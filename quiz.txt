Published in the Journal of Agricultural, Resource Economics, Volume 40, Issue 3, Pages 571-592
Abstract: This paper examines how farmers’ expectations about future commodity prices affect their current planting decisions. We use a unique data set that combines information from the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) with detailed farm-level price and yield data collected by Purdue University’s Center for Commodity Market Analysis (CCMA). Our analysis shows that farmers who expect higher future prices are more likely to plant corn, soybeans, and wheat. We also find evidence of a positive relationship between expected returns on investment in irrigation equipment and the probability of adopting this technology. Finally, we show that these relationships hold even after controlling for other factors such as farm size, crop rotation, and weather conditions. Our results suggest that farmers’ expectations about future prices play an important role in their decision-making process and can have significant implications for the agricultural sector.
Introduction: Farmers' planting decisions are influenced by a variety of factors, including current market prices, expected returns on investment, weather conditions, and government policies. However, one factor that has received relatively little attention is farmers' expectations about future commodity prices. These expectations can play an important role in shaping farmers' planting decisions, as they may influence their willingness to take risks and invest in new technologies or crops. In this paper, we

Q3. Which cities are new entrants to the top 10 list for workcations in 2 Written as a letter, what is the value of $f(x+4)$ if $f(x) = -2x^2 + 3$?

# Answer
To find the value of $f(x+4)$, we need to substitute $(x+4)$ into the function for every instance of $x$.

Given:
\[ f(x) = -2x^2 + 3 \]

We want to find:
\[ f(x+4) = -2(x+4)^2 + 3 \]

Expanding $(x+4)^2$:
\[ (x+4)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16 \]

Now substitute this back into the function:
\[ f(x+4) = -2(x^2 + 8x + 16) + 3 \]

Distribute the $-2$:
\[ f(x+4) = -2x^2 - 16x - 32 + 3 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ f(x+4) = -2x^2 - 16x - 29 \]

So, the value of $f(x+4)$ is $-2x^2 - 16x - 29$.

Published on: September 1, 2022 - 3:45 AM

The world's largest tech companies are racing to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models that can outperform human capabilities in various tasks. Among these contenders is Microsoft's GPT-5, a cutting-edge AI model that has already made significant strides in the field of natural language processing and understanding.

According to recent reports, startups like Cursor, Vercel, and Factory have quickly adopted GPT-5 as their default model for key products and tools within just one week of its release. These companies are touting several advantages offered by GPT-5, including faster setup times, improved performance on complex tasks, and a lower price point compared to other AI models in the market.

Behind the scenes, Microsoft has been investing heavily in building an enterprise sales team led by COO Brad Lightcap, which operates independently from its primary cloud partner, Microsoft itself. This move signifies Microsoft's commitment to expanding GPT-5's reach and influence within the corporate world.

During OpenAI's launch livestream, co-founder and CEO Michael Truell emphasized that GPT-5 is "the smartest coding model we've ever tried." However, it's important to note that this change applies only to new sign-ups; existing Cursor customers will continue using Anthropic as their default AI model.

Enterprise adoption of GPT-5 has been impressive so far, with the company reporting an 80% revenue contribution from enterprise clients and a remarkable annualized growth rate of 17 times over the past year. In just six months, OpenAI generated $3 billion in revenue, including $1 billion in June alone. The number of eight- and nine-figure deals signed this year has already tripled
