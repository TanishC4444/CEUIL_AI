Published in the Journal of Agricultural, Resource Economics, Volume 40, Issue 3, Pages 571-592
Abstract: This paper examines how farmers’ expectations about future commodity prices affect their current planting decisions. We use a unique data set that combines information from the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) with detailed farm-level price and yield data collected by Purdue University’s Center for Commodity Market Analysis (CCMA). Our analysis shows that farmers who expect higher future prices are more likely to plant corn, soybeans, and wheat. We also find evidence of a positive relationship between expected returns on investment in irrigation equipment and the probability of adopting this technology. Finally, we show that these relationships hold even after controlling for other factors such as farm size, crop rotation, and weather conditions. Our results suggest that farmers’ expectations about future prices play an important role in their decision-making process and can have significant implications for the agricultural sector.
Introduction: Farmers' planting decisions are influenced by a variety of factors, including current market prices, expected returns on investment, weather conditions, and government policies. However, one factor that has received relatively little attention is farmers' expectations about future commodity prices. These expectations can play an important role in shaping farmers' planting decisions, as they may influence their willingness to take risks and invest in new technologies or crops. In this paper, we
