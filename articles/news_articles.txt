Article: Swing and a miss: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) says the US added just 73,000 jobs in July, and those gains were almost entirely propped up by two industries: healthcare and social assistance. Another lost job: Hours after the revised data was released, President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing the Biden appointee of manipulating the numbers without providing evidence for that claim. The president called Powell a “stubborn MORON” who should be put “out to pasture,” and said if Powell doesn’t cut rates soon, the Fed’s Board of Governors should assume control of the central bank. And another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, announced Friday that she’s leaving her role at the central bank even though her term is not over, opening the door for Trump to appoint someone more inclined to cut interest rates.—BC

Article: Last night, with a self-imposed midnight deadline looming for the end of the tariff pause, meaning countries that hadn’t reached a new trade deal with the US would get turned into a pumpkin slapped with higher tariffs, President Trump rolled out new tariffs to be imposed on imports from dozens of countries—but pushed off their implementation until Aug. A senior US official told Bloomberg that the rates fell into roughly three groups: 10% for countries where the US has a trade surplus, 15% for those where the US has a small trade deficit, and higher for countries with a large deficit or that didn’t strike deals: For countries that did make deals–including Japan, Britain, the EU, Indonesia, and South Korea—the order appears to reflect the tariffs that were agreed to, even though the details are still being worked out. Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25%, but that this would exclude any goods covered by the trade deal he brokered with Canada and Mexico during his first term. There’s no getting around them: The order imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods deemed “transhipped,” which means made in one country with components from another to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile…a federal appeals court appeared skeptical yesterday of Trump’s legal power to set tariffs without congressional approval while hearing the Justice Department’s appeal of a federal trade court’s May ruling that struck down the tariffs (but was then halted).

The industry veteran inherited a mess worse than a lavatory after a 14-hour flight when he stepped into the role last summer, amid regulatory scrutiny over safety lapses and just before a nearly two-month strike in the fall that hampered assembly lines and, consequently, Boeing’s cash flow. But Ortberg said recently that 2025 can be the company’s “turnaround year.” In Q2, Boeing ramped up production of its best-selling 737 Max aircraft to 38 per month—the legal limit set by federal regulators—and it aims to get permission to bump that to 42 soon. Looking ahead…to convert its $522 billion order backlog into more revenue, the planemaker needs the government to green-light more of its plane models, but the target for getting the new Boeing 737 Max 7 and Max 10 certified was pushed back from this year to 2026.

The law is mainly intended to shield minors from pornography and anything that promotes eating disorders or self-harm, but critics aren’t sure this is the best way to go about it: Some sites ask for selfies, videos, or photos of IDs to check users’ ages, which has privacy experts worried about potential data breaches, since an age verification platform used by TikTok, Uber, and X left personal info exposed last year, according to 404 Media. Some tricksters have gotten creative: Gamers who didn’t want to hand over a facial scan figured out that they could get past Reddit and Discord’s age-verification checks by pointing their phone cameras at the face of the main character in Death Stranding.

Article: The parents in 19 Kids and Counting probably wish they lived in China, where the government will pay families $500 a year per baby until the child turns three, state media reported yesterday. The cash is meant to be a birthing incentive to remedy the country’s ongoing population decline, which threatens to undermine its economy: China’s fertility rate dropped from 2.51 children per woman in 1990 to 1.01 last year, well below the 2.1 rate needed to maintain a stable population. Local governments in China already offer their own baby bucks incentives, with the capital of the Inner Mongolia region offering the most generous subsidy of up to $14,000 per child. The Trump administration has reportedly considered a $5,000 “baby bonus,” and the recently passed Republican tax bill included the government funding a $1,000 investment account for babies born through 2028.

Article: After an hourlong meeting, the pair emerged with what Trump called “the biggest deal ever made.” The European Union’s 27 countries will be charged a baseline tariff of 15% on most exports. Europe wanted a zero-to-zero tariff deal or a 10% rate, like the UK negotiated, but ended up with less than the 20% tariff Trump originally announced in April and the 30% rate he floated on July 12. “It is the best we could get,” von der Leyen said, acknowledging that the negotiations started from “an imbalance,” a reference to the US’ significant trade deficit with the EU. However, von der Leyen said that the 15% rate would not stack on top of industry-specific tariffs already in place, and that the deal provided “stability” and “predictability” for the EU. No written documents were immediately provided with the announcement, and more details will likely be clarified this week, but the biggest takeaways yesterday were: The 50% tariff on steel from Europe remains in place.

The legal standard could make proving Tesla’s liability difficult: As The Verge reported, it’s likely an uphill climb for the plaintiffs, since the court is using Florida’s standard, which is “whether the car manufacturer exhibited a reckless disregard for human life equivalent to manslaughter by designing and marketing the vehicle.” As for other states…few have language on the books to determine who is liable in the case of an autonomous vehicle accident. Bottom line: Should Tesla lose this case, it could hurt the company’s reputation and further damage its already flagging sales, as the company has staked its future on growing its robotaxi fleet.—DL

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — After weeks of protests following a six-alarm fire at The Cooper Apartments, dozens of tenants displaced by that fire have filed a lawsuit against the complex seeking damages. According to a press release from Varghese Summersett, the Texas law firm representing the tenants in the case, some residents have been told they'll never be allowed to access their apartment or belongings, losing irreplaceable possessions and critical documents. This is cruelty piled on top of catastrophe.” In addition to the apartment complex, the apartment owner, the property management, the electrical contractor, the owner of the electrical contractor and the electrician on site that day are all listed as defendants in the suit. “I have to live with that for the rest of my life.” Another plaintiff, Zaire Harris, described the uncertainty and stress of going weeks without basic needs or access to his home. “Fluffy words, very little action.” Attorney Katie Steele, who is representing a growing group of 49 former residents, said her clients were not only displaced but also denied basic tenant rights. "I hope we get to the bottom of what happened and how it got to be so bad." Steele has also reportedly sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction of any portions of the apartment complex in order to preserve evidence. A spokesperson for The Cooper said in a statement to WFAA, "We are reviewing the allegations in the lawsuit and are unable to comment." A resident of The Cooper Apartments, who is among the complainants in the suit, shared a lease termination notice dated July 31, 2025, which said the following: The lease is terminated, effective seven days after the date of the letter Leases terminated Aug. 7 as notice was sent July 31 Tenants cannot access the apartment to retrieve their belongings because the building is structurally unsafe, all personal belongings were destroyed in fire and the units are too toxic Tenants will be refunded pro-rated rent from the date of the fire to the lease termination date as well as all deposits All remaining personal property will be thrown away, citing it as a health and safety hazard According to the Fort Worth Fire Department, the fire was reported around 1:30 p.m.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn't distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba's speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: ATLANTA — The Detroit Lions said safety Morice Norris was in stable condition after he was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions’ preseason game Friday night against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support.” Lions coach Dan Campbell asked for prayers for the 24-year-old Norris. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back’s midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we’ve all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.” When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board.” Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. “We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone’s eyes and see that.” Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

"This is a situation where you've got the needs of the many clearly outweigh the needs of a few or one." Hering tells WFAA that he and a lot of his neighbors do not oppose the family and their decisions to build or subdivide the land.

Article: City officials faced significant challenges preparing the budget, as Dallas grapples with a lower-than-expected sales tax revenue report, an increase in home appraisal appeals and a voter-approved mandate to hire hundreds of new police officers. In addition, Dallas increased the property tax exemption for seniors aged 65 and older or residents with disabilities for the seventh year in a row, raising it from $153,400 to $175,000. "This budget reflects a reimagining of service delivery, the elimination of duplications, the optimization of operational efficiencies and other measures that maintain responsiveness to the needs of the city." Budget Highlights: Keep Dallas safe by hiring 350 police recruits and retaining seasoned officers to end FY 2025-26 with 3,424 officers, the highest number since 2016. Working to provide market-based pay and step pay increases in accordance with the Meet and Confer Agreement for uniform employees, which expires in September, negotiations are underway for the new agreement. Continue with proven strategies to end street homelessness incrementally across the city, including accelerated diversion and rehousing from shelters, to prevent street sleeping with a $10 million investment to move more people inside and prevent overflow into our streets.

Article: 15 over claims that it has become "the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. Asana Partners, a real estate investment firm that owns several properties in the neighborhood — including some near the popular but controversial bar Rodeo Dallas — has filed for a temporary restraining order to have Rodeo's doors shut for the second time this week, according to court documents obtained by WFAA. Before the weekend began, Asana Partners filed the restraining order against Rodeo Ranch Texas LLC on Friday, accusing the bar of being “the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” "The wrongful activities emanating from Rodeo Dallas are egregious -- unfettered violence, drug use, displays of firearms, underage drinking, excessively loud music, massive uncontrollable crowds and murder," Asana Partners said in the original petition for the restraining order. "Deep Ellum as a whole is flourishing, but the ongoing operation of Rodeo Dallas must be immediately retrained to prevent further irreparable harm to [Asana Partners] and the entire Deep Ellum community." On Tuesday, WFAA spoke with nearby business owners and employees, many of whom celebrated the initial closure, calling it a win for the neighborhood. It's worth noting that a situation like this, where neighboring landlords file restraining orders to shutter businesses, is unprecedented for Deep Ellum, let alone a landlord locking out its tenant, which consistently ranks in the top 15 of alcohol sales for all of Dallas, according to the state. A sign was left on the door stating, "You will be missed." Managing Director of Asset Management for Asana Partners, Chris Dalton, provided the following statement on the temporary restraining order: "At today's 3pm hearing in the 44th District Court in Dallas County, Judge Veretta Frazier ruled in favor of the Temporary Restraining Order filed by Asana Partners against Rodeo Dallas. We thank and are encouraged by Judge Veretta Frazier and the 44th District Court for supporting efforts to protect Deep Ellum and the people who visit, work, and live there." Frazier listened to arguments from attorneys for Rodeo and Asana Partners Friday afternoon. "They want to pump as much alcohol into young folks as they can, and there are no concerns whatsoever for the ramifications or for anyone who lives in this community," attorney Ben Riemer said in court on behalf of Asana Partners. Dave Wishnew, an attorney for Rodeo, fought back, saying Asana Partners isn't representing the city or a community -- only business as a whole in the area and that Asana Partners is not aware of what Rodeo is doing to remedy issues with its landlord, Westdale, or the city. The city attorney of Dallas sent Rodeo a warning letter on July 30, listing several code violations that Rodeo had committed, such as operating as a restaurant rather than a bar, lacking a dance-hall license, and running a mechanical bull without a permit. Measures are in place for this weekend, and nobody is inviting crime into this business." Wishnew also stressed that the bar has no control over what people do outside of it and only inside of it, noting that over a dozen crimes the city connected to the establishment in the letter were never committed on the premises.

Article: Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. Bush said in a statement Friday night that Webster's “passion for the rule of law and for the greatness of America made him a model public servant.” President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path,” said David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, science team leader for the Hubble observations. Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles (tens of kilometers) across, but Hubble’s observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers).

Article: — A man suspected in a shooting at a Montana bar that left four people dead was captured Friday just a few miles from where the shooting happened after hundreds of law enforcement officers spent the past week scouring nearby mountainsides, authorities said. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a news conference that about 130 law enforcement officers made a hard push Thursday after getting tips that helped verify they were looking in the right area. Greg Gianforte first confirmed Brown’s capture on social media Friday afternoon, saying it was the result of what he called a “Herculean effort” from law enforcement officers across the state. The community finally would be able to sleep tonight, Anaconda-Deer Valley County Attorney Morgan Smith said, adding that the case is just the beginning for prosecutors who will be seeking to charge Brown with the killings. Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, said search teams found Brown at a structure near The Ranch Bar and that he looked to be “in pretty good shape, physically.” He was communicative and able to identify himself, Johnson said. Eric Hempstead, who owns The Ranch Bar, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) west of The Owl Bar, described an intense law enforcement presence in the densely wooded area over the last couple of days that involved search dogs and drones. Brown, who lived next door to The Owl Bar in Anaconda, served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005. The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Law Enforcement Department did not respond this week to several email and phone messages requesting records of the welfare checks Boyle said they helped conduct on Brown in the years leading up to the shooting.

He also said he and his client are in it "for the long fight and look forward to their day in court." The lawsuit was filed in Dallas County in September 2020 against Jones and the Dallas Cowboys by a woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe, who alleged in the lawsuit that Jones forcibly grabbed her and kissed her on the mouth in September 2018. The initial lawsuit didn’t detail where the alleged incident happened, but in a refiled version of the lawsuit, she alleged it happened in the Tom Landry room at AT&T Stadium.

Article: In the video, Thalia Salinas, 23, sits surrounded by her four closest friends — Ruby Cruz, Brianna Valadez, Jackie Velazco and Desiree Cervantes — as they sing to her, celebrating another year of life. On July 25, the longtime friends were heading to the lake when, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, a Dodge Ram 4500 pulling a horse trailer swerved into oncoming traffic on U.S. "I gave each one of them their last hug, and I truly… I’m glad I did.” Ruby’s younger sister, Ana Cruz, said her final conversation with her sister came just hours before the crash. "Those were the last words that came out of my mouth that I loved.” Thalia’s older brother, Sal Salinas, remembers the constant energy and noise in their home when the girls were together. "Her favorite things to do were go to the beach, go to the lake, anything water… all five of them are regularly at her house… just watching videos, listening to music, a bunch of random laughter very loud through the walls here.” Anger over driver leaving scene without testing The driver accused of causing the crash, 37-year-old Kody Talley, was not tested for drugs or alcohol before being released from the scene, despite having what the families say is a lengthy and troubling criminal record. Commercial driving questions: At the time of the crash, Talley was reportedly driving for his father’s company, hauling a trailer loaded with horses — something the families say raises questions about whether he should have been behind the wheel at all, given his history.

Article: WYLIE, Texas — If students at Wylie High School don't comply with a new state law about the use, or more accurately, the lack of use, of their cell phones and other communication devices, they will be sent to see Student Services Secretary Beth McPherson. "I give them the top copy," she said, tearing off a duplicate receipt at her desk in a small office off the main hallway at the high school of approximately 3,000 students. Wylie ISD, like all other school districts across Texas, is working to comply with House Bill 1481, which requires all school districts and open-enrollment charter schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal communication devices (cell phones, personal iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) while on school property during the school day. "The first day I was reaching, like where's my phone," said Wylie High School junior Julia Hudgins, admitting that it was a bit of an adjustment on Thursday, the first day of the school year. "There are some people that are just on their phones 24/7, sit in the back, take naps, just do whatever," Wylie High senior Eli Martin said of previous school years. "But now that's gone, I see them like they're sitting up, they're paying attention now." School districts are making exceptions for students who might need their phones to monitor glucose levels for diabetes or need them to operate hearing aid devices.

Article: Well, the implementation of that law -- which was passed by the Texas Legislature this year -- might vary from district to district, even if the intended effect is still the same: Students won't be able to use their phones in school. Here are the policies that several larger districts in North Texas have passed: Dallas ISD The new DISD policy bans cell phone use all day and includes escalating levels of punishment for each violation: 1st violation – phone confiscated, returned to parent/guardian 2nd – returned with $5 fee 3rd – returned with $10 fee 4th – returned with $15 fee The district decided that elementary teachers will collect cell phones and secure them during the day, and secondary campuses will give students a pouch to store their devices. Arlington ISD The Arlington district announced an "Away for the Day" cell phone policy, requiring students' personal devices -- including smartwatches, cell phones and tablets -- to be powered off and "out of sight" during all parts of the school day, including class time, transition between classes and at lunch. The police comes with four levels of discipline for each time a student violates the policy, from device confiscation and contacting a parent (first offense) to in-school suspension (third offense) and then, on a fourth violation, an assignment to the district's Choices program. Plano ISD The Plano district passed a policy requiring students to have all personal communication devices powered off and stored out of sight in their backpacks from the time they enter the building until they leave for the day. Duncanville ISD Duncanville students will have to power off their devices all day, although each individual campus will decide how the devices will be stored, according to the district's policy. Allen ISD Allen students will not be allowed to use phones or other communication devices from the time they arrive at school until they leave, including passing periods and at lunch, the new policy says.

Article: DALLAS — California Congressman Kevin Kiley, R- District 3, is one of the many Republicans who doesn't agree with any effort to redistrict mid-decade, like what is happening in Texas. And now that leaders in Democrat-run states such as California, Illinois and New York, are threatening to redraw their congressional lines to ice out the GOP, many blue state Republicans such as Kiley are growing increasingly alarmed that their seats will suddenly become vulnerable. Gavin Newsom for “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California,” the Republican did acknowledge to us that the fight started with Texas Republicans.

Article: HOUSTON — Billy Howton, a former Green Bay Packers star regarded as one of the most productive wide receivers of the pre-Super Bowl era who was a founder and the first president of the NFL Players Association, has died. Because of Billy’s advocacy as our first president, today’s players have a pension, disability benefits & a voice of their own in the business of football.” Howton scored the Packers' first receiving touchdown at Lambeau Field in 1957. He holds Green Bay's single-game franchise record with 257 receiving yards in a 1956 game against the Los Angeles Rams, and when he retired in 1963, he was the NFL's all-time leading receiver in receptions (503) and receiving yards (8,459). “For my money, Howton is the toughest pass receiver to cover in the National League,” Hall of Fame safety Emlen Tunnell said before the 1958 season, which was Howton’s last with the Packers. “He was an extremely dangerous receiver and had great technique.” After seven years in Green Bay, Howton was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1959 and then to Dallas as a member of the Cowboys' inaugural team in 1960. He represented the Packers at the first NFLPA meeting in 1956 and brought with him a list of four grievances that famously included a need for clean towels, shirts and jock straps for second practices — when NFL teams held two practices a day. He was elected as the organization's first president in 1958 and threatened to bring an antitrust suit against the NFL if it didn't establish a pension plan for retired players.

Article: Gavin Newsom, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and others about GOP-led redistricting efforts in Texas and a responding redistricting effort in heavily-Democratic California. "We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all." Pelosi introduced California Gov. Newsom likewise called the Texas Democratic lawmakers' efforts and California's potential redistricting efforts bids to "defend democracy." "We are trying to defend democracy as opposed to see it destroyed district by district, and we will stand firm," Newsom said. We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people and that's the difference between the approach we're taking and the approach they're taking." Watch Friday's full press conference below Newsom said he's calling for a special election in California in November, and the California Legislature has until Aug. In response to a question about how voters can be confident California's redistricting effort would be a "one-time exception" to California's independent redistricting commission, Newsom offered the following statement: "I'd say we want to do it for the '26, '28, '30 ballots just for congressional representatives alone. What is happening in Texas, what is being pushed out by the Trump administration beyond Texas, is something we thought we would never see where people's lives, their representation, their participation is willingly stifled, violently stifled," California Assembly Member Isaac Bryan said. "This is not just about lines on the map, this is about lives on the line.” Ahead of the press conferences, the Texas House again failed to establish quorum Friday, as our sister station KVUE reported. In addition to daily fines, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that he and Comptroller Kelly Hancock have enacted a new policy to prevent the absent lawmakers from having their paycheck, or per diem, deposited electronically. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also filed a lawsuit Friday in a bid for the Supreme Court of Texas to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic state representatives who left the state. I have asked the Texas Supreme Court to declare what has been clear from the beginning: that the runaway members have officially vacated their offices in the Texas House.” In addition to filing the petition, Paxton and Burrows moved to enforce civil arrest warrants in other states.

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. Lovell and fellow astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert received renewed fame with the retelling of the Apollo 13 mission in the 1995 movie “Apollo 13" where actor Tom Hanks — portraying Lovell — famously said, “Houston, we have a problem.” In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death affected him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises.” Lovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn't display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. I measure risk.'” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “He was a member of really the first generation of American astronauts and went on to inspire multiple generations of Americans to look at the stars and want to explore,” said Bruce McClintock, who leads the RAND Corp. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn't have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA's historian. Lovell showed a “leadership role and heroic efforts in the recovery of Apollo 13.” By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: The Senate confirmed Long on a 53-44 vote despite Democrats’ concerns about the Republican’s past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after Trump nominated him. Before Long's confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS.

Article: MCALLEN, Texas — A judge on Friday was considering a Trump administration request to end a decades-old policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody that the government says is inhibiting its immigration crackdown. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.” “It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Detroit safety Morice Norris was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions' preseason game against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. ATLANTA, Georgia -- Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. "It's never good when they bring out the stretchers." With 6:31 remaining in the fourth quarter, an official announced the game had been suspended "per New York" with the Lions leading the Falcons 17-10. We agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game." Norris, a former Fresno State standout, played in eight games last season after earning a spot on the team as an undrafted rookie.

Article: That particular wave is just coming off the coast of Africa, meaning that even if it were to eventually impact the U.S., it wouldn't be for another 10 to 12 days, giving us plenty of time to keep a watchful eye on it. August 3 There is now a low chance for development over the eastern Atlantic as a tropical wave is expected to move off the coast of Africa in the next day or two. July 29 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms and two named storms, the Atlantic Basin remains quiet for now with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 28 Update While the central and eastern Pacific basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements." One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times - Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 - with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame - thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions - and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission - immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell - that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Hanks posted a tribute to Lovell on Instagram Friday, writing, "There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive - and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites Friday morning. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they "are deteriorating." "It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it's willful," said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," where a lawsuit alleges detainees' constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump's tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

READ RELATED: Judge Lina Hidalgo's 'penny tax proposal' fails to pass; Commissioners Court meeting turns to chaos Hidalgo invited several children to attend the meeting, which devolved into commissioners arguing with and reprimanding Hidalgo. Ramsey said he feels it's the commissioners court's responsibility to "explore every option for ensuring our meetings remain professional and productive, including, if warranted, the potential removal of a court member." According to Texas state law, the county judge can be removed for incompetency or misconduct, but Ramsey acknowledged such a move would "involve significant, important, legal and procedural steps." ABC13 reached out to Judge Hidalgo regarding Ramsey's comments, but there has been no response. The decision to remove or keep an elected official is one that should be made by the voters through the electoral process."

Article: A shooting outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters on Friday left a police officer dead and officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency shaken. Citing a senior law enforcement official, The New York Times reported the shooter, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was fixated on the Covid vaccine, which he blamed for his health problems. In response to the shooting and reports of White’s motivations, newly appointed CDC Director Susan Monarez convened an online all-hands meeting of the agency division that focuses on vaccines — the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It is not fair to all of you who’ve given so much to contribute to public health,” Monarez told employees during the meeting Saturday, according to a recording reviewed by MSNBC. One said they felt like “sitting ducks.” As the leaders spoke, dozens of staffers posted messages in the meeting chat, many naming Kennedy, who oversees the CDC at the Department of Health and Human Services, citing his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines and vilifying the health agencies he now leads. One employee described the shooting as “the culmination of ongoing animosity toward CDC and the work that we do — not a one-off incident.” Another named Kennedy in a comment that drew dozens of supportive emoji reactions, writing: “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation. In videos from anti-vaccine conferences between 2013 and 2019, he likened the agency’s vaccine work to “fascism” and “child abuse,” called it a “cesspool of corruption” and said it was filled with profiteers. At a 2013 conference, when asked about why the CDC had failed to acknowledge the autism epidemic (which he falsely linked to vaccines), Kennedy said it was like the Holocaust. During the pandemic, Kennedy repeatedly framed the CDC and other HHS agencies as “corrupt,” falsely suggested Covid-19 was a “bioweapon,” and lied about the dangers of Covid vaccines, calling them “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” “The hatred RFK and his allies have spent their lives stoking puts a target on the backs of anyone in public health,” said one senior official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the agency and so they could speak critically about Kennedy. Monarez called it “a good question” and said the CDC had been in “constant communication” with his office and that “more will be coming.” Kennedy did post a message of support to the CDC from his HHS account shortly after the meeting. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.” The shooting marks a low point in an already dark period for public health.

Article: Temperatures will hit the triple digits in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys on Thursday, while interior regions of Los Angeles County will see temperatures in the 90s, according to the National Weather Service. California California fires are burning and incoming heat wave could make things worse A widespread heat wave is expected to intensify fire concerns across California as temperatures rise and landscapes further dry out. “A slight cooling trend is [forecast for] Friday through the weekend but temperatures will remain above normal away from the immediate coast well into next week.” Advertisement The sustained hot weather will continue to dry out vegetation, increasing the risk of wildfire starts and worsening conditions around blazes already burning across Central and Southern California, including the state’s largest this year: the 96,106-acre Gifford fire in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, quickly grew to more than 1,000 acres, prompting evacuation orders in Piru, Castaic, Val Verde and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles county fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by onshore winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour, according to Cal Fire and the National Weather Service. Conditions on Thursday will be even hotter in the Inland Empire and inland areas of San Diego County, where the weather service has issued regional heat advisories through Friday evening. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, grew to 600 acres in a little over an hour prompting evacuation orders in nearby communities of Piru, Castiac, Val Verde, and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles County fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by on shore winds, according to Cal Fire. “We’ll have pretty gusty onshore winds, anywhere from 15 to 25 miles an hour, with gusts to 20 to 40 across the interior locations each afternoon and evening, strongest across the I-5 corridor, Antelope Valley and southwest Santa Barbara County coast,” Black said. “With that, we’ll have an extended period of elevated fire weather risk.” California is already on pace for the worst wildfire year in recent history, driven by several large fires in Central and Southern California — including the Gifford fire and the devastating January firestorms in Los Angeles County. Advertisement As of Thursday morning, the Gifford fire was 15% contained, according to federal officials, after hot conditions and continued fire growth challenged firefighters and triggered additional evacuation orders and warnings for rural communities near the Los Padres National Forest.

Article: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel’s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in what local media called one of the largest anti-government protests in recent months following 22 months of war. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Health officials said that 20 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours, as the criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food to reach people in the besieged enclave. ‘Shut the country down’ Hostages’ families pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government amid new fears for the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” WATCH: Netanyahu’s Gaza takeover won’t end Hamas influence in the region, Mideast analyst says A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel’s decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel’s decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel’s plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites In the north, Israeli fire killed at least nine and wounded over 200 as people sought aid entering Gaza through the Zikim crossing, said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service in the area. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn. More deaths from hunger Gaza’s Health Ministry said the new adult deaths from malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours brought the total to 114 since it began counting such deaths in June.

Article: WASHINGTON — The White House is considering inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Alaska, where President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, according to a senior U.S. But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were "decisions against peace," adding, "They will not achieve anything." The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday. The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. The White House had made a Putin meeting with Zelenskyy a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. If Zelenskyy were to travel to Alaska, it is not clear if he and Putin would ever be in the same room, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. The surge in diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine comes after Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow ahead of a deadline on Friday that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. Zelenskyy said defiantly on Saturday that Ukrainians "will not give their land to occupiers." Trump said Friday that between Russia and Ukraine, "there'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both." Administration officials were working on Saturday to try to gain support for a potential ceasefire from Ukrainian government and European leaders.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

Article: The order came at the request of AG Ken Paxton, whom O’Rourke accused in a separate lawsuit of going on a "fishing expedition, constitutional rights be damned." (The Texas Tribune) Former U.S. Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton’s request for a temporary injunction, barring O’Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton’s contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either “directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators” to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for “unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators’ Constitutional duties.” O’Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O’Rourke said Paxton was trying to “make examples out of those who fight so that others won’t.” “Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, [President Donald] Trump and Abbott have on power in Texas,” O’Rourke said. With few tools to stop the map’s passage through the Republican-dominated Legislature, Democrats called on their one failsafe, leaving the state to deny quorum, or the minimum number of members required for the chamber to function. But this time, Republicans have gone on the offensive, filing lawsuits to cut off financial support; asking Illinois courts to enforce Texas’ civil warrants; investigating members and donors for bribery; and, in an unprecedented move, asking the Texas Supreme Court to expel lawmakers who left.

Article: Having finished 15 points adrift of their city rivals last season, Rangers are already a one behind Celtic before Brendan Rodgers' side play their game in hand in Aberdeen on Sunday. If Rangers get through their Euro tie after Tuesday's second leg against Plzen, they will postpone the league match against St Mirren on 24 August to prepare for the play-off tie, which means they could be seven behind by the time Celtic visit Ibrox the following week. It can be argued they were fortunate to escape Motherwell with a point last weekend, while Rangers had to play the final half hour against Dundee with 10 men before captain James Tavernier came off the bench to rescue another with his late spot kick. A "disappointed" Martin admitted: "There was just general lethargy and no speed in the first half." After last week's draw at Fir Park, Martin had questioned the mentality of some of his players, complaining that some "have to drop their ego", and was delighted with the reaction against Plzen. This time, he was "pleased with the response of the team when we went down to 10 men and we could've won the game in the end, but the mentality has to come from the very first kick of the match". Martin accepted some of the blame, admitting: "In hindsight, I should've made some changes to inject that energy in the team, but I explained my decision before the game and maybe I could've changed that now the game is finished. "We're learning about the group all the time, so that's a lesson learnt today." BBC pundit and former Rangers striker described them as "Jekyll and Hyde" but pointed out that the same happened under the previous two team bosses - Philippe Clement and Barry Ferguson - last season.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. WATCH: ‘The Devil Reached Toward the Sky’ documents motivation and development of the atomic bomb About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn’t distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” READ MORE: At 80th anniversary of Hiroshima bombing, survivors fear lessons may be forgotten as nuclear threat rises In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba’s speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: European officials presented their own Ukraine peace proposals to the United States on Saturday as President Donald Trump prepared for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war. The Wall Street Journal said European officials had presented a counterproposal that included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken and that any territory exchange must be reciprocal, with firm security guarantees. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke and pledged to find a "just and lasting peace" in Ukraine and "unwavering support" for Zelenskyy, while welcoming Trump's efforts to end the fighting, a Downing Street spokesperson said. "The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle." He had earlier rejected any territorial concessions, saying "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." The Trump administration is considering inviting Zelenskyy to join the U.S. "Ukraine's future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now," he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer.

In a brief post on the social media platform X, UEFA called the former national team member “a talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times”. The United Nations says that more than 1,000 people have been killed near aid distribution sites and aid convoys in Gaza since the launch of the GHF, a United States- and Israel-backed aid distribution system, in late May.

Article: Mars rock found in Niger sells for millions in New York - now the country wants answers 40 minutes ago Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save EPA The Martian meteorite found in Niger went on display in New York before it was auctioned "Brazen! He makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer. At first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find – less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour. Reuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth Sotheby's strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa). An Italian academic article published last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Niger's Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by "a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed". Meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. According to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was "sold by the local community to an international dealer" and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo. "As with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved." A spokesperson added that Sotheby's was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and "we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised". The academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the country's vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Niger's cultural and natural heritage – including anything that has fallen from outer space - returned. But, according to a 2019 study by international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. AFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks Morocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites - more than 1,000 - found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara. More than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a "Saharan gold rush", fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours. It's a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but it's the same state in all our countries." Prof Sereno hopes that the Sotheby's sale will prove a turning-point - firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly "if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it".

Article: What it means to be 'culturally' Irish in 2025 is complicated - as Ed Sheeran has shown 38 minutes ago Share Save Fergal Keane • @fergalkeane47 Special correspondent Share Save BBC He sang wistfully of the English town that shaped his life. But I can't wait to go home." Ed Sheeran grew up in Framlingham in Suffolk and its rolling hills and magnificent castle inspired his hit single, Castle on the Hill. "I can be allowed to feel a connection to a place half my family is from." Yet he was accused of being Irish "when it suits him" by one poster. Another wrote on X: "I've seen B*Witched live and have watched a couple of Gaelic football games, which I think gives me an even more legitimate claim to be culturally Irish than Ed Sheeran." Getty Images Ed Sheeran said: 'I class my culture as Irish. "That doesn't mean to say he doesn't like or love being British, that is part of him too." Certainly it is much easier to speak of an Irish identity in Britain now that there is peace in Northern Ireland. As the Belfast South MP, Claire Hanna, who is now leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told parliament during a St Patrick's Day debate in 2022: "Many are moving on from the traditional binaries of the past and embracing the 'or both' part of the Good Friday agreement, not feeling that they have to decide between being British and Irish if they do not wish to do so." Sheeran's declaration raises this point once again, and prompts the deeper question of what cultural "Irishness" really is today. Identity versus citizenship Professor Linda Connolly, director of sociology at Maynooth University in County Kildare, argues that Ed Sheeran's statement is about an idea of identity that is bigger than where you were born or what you write on a census form. I am also a Cork, Kerry and Waterford person' (County Cork pictured) For many unionists, staunch political loyalty to Britain and the Monarchy, sits alongside a deep attachment to the land they have lived on for hundreds of years. There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup. Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles Everyone has their own menu of what being "culturally Irish" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously. It runs a wide spectrum of styles, influences, opinions and genres - from Oasis (born in Manchester to Irish parents), the rappers Kneecap, novelist Sally Rooney, the Irish actress of Nigerian descent Demi Isaac Oviawe, the London-born playwright Martin McDonagh of The Banshees of Inisherin fame. Getty Images Noel and Liam Gallagher were born in Manchester to Irish parents The core members of The Beatles all had Irish grandparents or great grandparents, prompting John Lennon to tell a concert in Dublin: "We're all Irish." That was in 1963 – some 62 years before Ed Sheeran's declaration. There are many voices too from the Irish Protestant tradition in Ulster – the singer Van Morrison and the novelist Jan Carson, who has written about growing up in an evangelical Christian home, and says she now feels "much more ease and comfort with an Irish identity than a British one". Getty Images Culturally Irish can mean a sense of a particular landscape - like the world of "the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting," evoked by Shane McGowan of the Pogues. Today, it is undoubtedly easier these days for a big mainstream star like Sheeran to embrace an Irish cultural identity in Britain than it would have been several decades ago. I think of the powerful song Nothing But the Same Old Story by Paul Brady, about an Irishman in Britain during the 1970s, amid the ongoing IRA campaign: "In their eyes, we're nothing but a bunch of murderers." Cross-fertilisation of cultures Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including legendary BBC presenter Terry Wogan and musicians such as U2, Thin Lizzy, Sinead O'Connor, the Pogues "and now Ed Sheeran!" Yet all of these icons are building on the foundations laid by the unacknowledged millions who came to Britain over many centuries. In those days, most Irish immigrants found expression of their culture in the ballrooms of places like Kilburn in northwest London, or the Astoria in Manchester, or the Irish pubs which often catered to clientele from a specific county. For two millennia there are records of the Irish trading, settling, and inter-marrying in Britain; they shared a common language with western Scotland and the Isle of Man, and a Druidic culture with the rest of Britain. Getty Images Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including the late Sinead O'Connor One of the bestselling songwriters of early 19th century Britain was Irishman Thomas Moore. His story typifies the often complex nature of cultural relationships: he was a champion of Irish liberty, but his great song "The Minstrel Boy" – written for rebels fighting Britain – is played by the band of the Irish Guards at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day. "The physical distance between Ireland and Britain has diminished in the Ryanair era… It seems to me also that Irish migration to Britain is now more likely to be temporary - people may come for a few years, then go home - whereas previously it was a more permanent departure." 'I'm an Irishman, and a Londoner - and much else too' I should declare an interest. Fergal Keane today, alongside a photo of him as an aspiring young folk singer back in Limerick in the 1980s The Irish language and music is an essential part of my cultural makeup. But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: "And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here." My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. 'The old battle of identities is far from finished' The nature of identity is evolving - in Ireland it is absorbing the influences of other cultures, but also influencing those cultures. Professor Nic Dháibhéid hopes the prominence of Irish cultural identities in Britain will prompt a greater interest in the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly among the under-25s who, as she sees it, "will have no memory of the Troubles, and so there is an even greater need to ensure that there is good mutual understanding between the people on our two islands." The big British audiences for Kneecap, to take an example, didn't happen because young people had a sudden awakening about the problems of life in nationalist west Belfast. Press Association The Derry Girls phenomenon is real, says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city It is important to recognise that the cultural influence can be polarising. One member of the band, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. "The Kneecap phenomenon is real, as is the Derry Girls one," says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, also referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city in the 1990s. I watch them navigate the challenges and opportunities of different and overlapping identities, encouraging them to follow James Joyce's advice and fly past any barriers others put in their way.

Article: "These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties," Serena says, "but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it." Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. "If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round." But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The "functional beverage" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could "prevent, treat or cure disease" were a step too far. Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. "In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks." Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. "I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option." Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, "crack on", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a "therapy session or a massage at the end of the month". "I'm ADHD," Emily says, "so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down." TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said

Article: 41 minutes ago Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save Universal Pictures/Prime Video The whole film shows either Ice Cube's computer screen or his face as seen on the monitor's camera Film critics have delivered a verdict: the new version of War of the Worlds – which stars Ice Cube as a man who must save humanity from an alien invasion without leaving his desk – is bad. 'Verges on parody' Lon Harris, executive producer of the This Week in Startups podcast, stoked the conversation this week when he posted: "Dipping below like 5% on Rotten Tomatoes has basically the same appeal to me as breaking 90%. "I watch a lot of movies, there's so much content coming out, and most of it is bland and forgettable." Harris was intrigued enough to watch War of the Worlds, and it duly lived down to his expectations. "It's very silly, Ice Cube's solo performance just reacting to things on his laptop screen verges at times on parody and frequently made me laugh, and there's a whole subplot involving Amazon drone deliveries that's so on-the-nose it's almost unbelievable that they included it," he says. "That's more interesting than just 'another alien invasion movie' to me." After its initial battering, one critic has now taken pity on War of the Worlds, having enjoyed watching it. It's certainly stupid, but it's also a great deal of fun." That write-up, which concluded that the "movie is a mess, but an uproarious one", was deemed positive by Rotten Tomatoes so has nudged the film's Tomatometer score up from 0% to the giddy heights of 4% at the time of writing. Getty Images Samurai Cop is famously bad but built up such a fanbase that it got a sequel 24 years later Truly atrocious movies are preferable to those that are simply forgettable, according to Timon Singh, who set up the Bristol Bad Film Club a decade ago. "In comparison, Samurai Cop is technically a terrible film, but it's 90 minutes of pure enjoyable terrible acting, awful fight scenes, and once you've seen it, you're never going to forget it. "Whereas you'll probably forget Transformers: The Last Knight while you're watching it."

Those claims – and the app's sudden surge in popularity – wiped $600bn (£446bn) or 17% off the market value of chip giant Nvidia, marking the largest one-day loss for a single stock in the history of the US stock market. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen referred to the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment," a reference to the Soviet satellite that had kicked off the space race between the US and the USSR more than a half century earlier. Bloomberg via Getty Images Shares of Japanese semiconductor-related companies extended a late January drop after the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek prompted a selloff in US tech stocks Still relevant It has now been six months since DeepSeek stunned the world. Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that "with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model". When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based. In online forums, users explain how to run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China - a workaround they believe can protect their data from being shared surreptitiously. "China was seen as playing catch-up in large language models until this point, with competitive models but always trailing the best western ones," policy analyst Wendy Chang of the Mercator Institute for China Studies told the BBC.

Article: Man's anger over number plate mix-up parking penalty 33 minutes ago Share Save Dan Martin & Ben Carr BBC News, Leicester Share Save Richard Lynn Richard Lynn said his vehicle was recorded entering the car park - but another with a nearly identical number plate was clocked leaving hours later A man was wrongly issued with a parking charge after his car was mixed up with another vehicle with a nearly identical number plate. Richard Lynn said that on 18 March 2024, he paid £1.70 to park for about 30 minutes in Rushton's Yard car park in Ashby, Leicestershire, but later received a demand for £165 from solicitors representing private firm Horizon Parking. The 53-year-old said photographic evidence, provided by the company, showed his Hyundai entering the car park - but a Kia with an identical number plate bar one letter leaving nine hours later. Supplied Horizon Parking provided photos showing Mr Lynn's car (left) with its number plate starting FH6 - and another car with an FP6 registration Reflecting on the situation, Mr Lynn said: "It's ridiculous. "The result of this is that I received a pretty nasty letter, threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay a fine I should not have been issued with in the first place." On 25 March 2024, Mr Lynn was sent a letter demanding £85 - £51 if he paid within 14 days. However, he said he only became aware of the matter in July this year - when he received a letter from solicitors acting on behalf of Horizon Parking demanding £165. Mr Lynn said he moved house in December 2022 but said he had, in error, not notified the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) of his change of address until some time in "early 2024".

Article: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposts video of pastors saying women shouldn't vote toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reposted and praised a video interview of a self-described Christian nationalist pastor whose church doesn't believe women shouldn't be allowed to vote. Doug Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, said during the interview with CNN that, "Women are the kind of people that people come out of." "The wife and mother, who is the chief executive of the home, is entrusted with three or four or five eternal souls," he continued. In his repost of the interview on the platform X, Hegseth added, "All of Christ for All of Life." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told NPR in an emailed statement on Saturday that Hegseth is a "proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches," which was founded by Wilson. In the CNN video, a congregant in Wilson's church explained that her husband "is the head of our household and I do submit to him." A fellow pastor also said that families should vote as a household, with the husband and father casting the vote. Andrew Whitehead, a sociology professor at Indiana University Indianapolis and an expert on Christian nationalism, told NPR the goal for Wilson and his followers is to spread these ideas across the country – and ultimately make them enforceable. "It really does matter if the Secretary of Defense is retweeting a video with very particular views about whether women should be able to vote or serve in combat roles or if slavery really isn't all that bad," Whitehead said.

Article: Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home’s front yard Officials plan to seek the death penalty for a Tennessee man charged with killing 4 TITPONVILLE, Tenn. -- Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home's front yard on Thursday. Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge. The Dyer County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that a caller reported a minivan or midsize SUV had dropped the infant at a “random individual’s front yard.” The sheriff’s office later said they were working with investigators in neighboring Lake County, where four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds. Hours before Tuesday's arrest, Jackson Police posted a roughly 20-second video surveillance clip showing someone they said was Drummond wearing camouflage and carrying a firearm, trying to enter the door of an unspecified building. Jackson Police Chief Thom Corley said the calls from the public helped officers arrest Drummond, who had been staying in a vacant building near the woods where he was taken into custody.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior FBI official who served as acting director in the first weeks of the Trump administration and resisted demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in the Jan. The circumstances of Brian Driscoll’s ouster were not immediately clear, but his final day is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The news comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of current director FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked international counterterrorism investigations in New York and had also commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys manpower and resources to crisis situations. Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination.” Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about President Donald Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. Wildlife biologists and a state veterinarian who visited the trail near Tupper Lake, New York, on Wednesday saw that the moose was severely emaciated and showed other signs of advanced disease. In addition, information gathered from this animal will help DEC better understand and manage moose in New York,” Jacqueline Lendrum, director of the agency's Division of Fish and Wildlife, said in a prepared statement. Jennifer Bloodgood of the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine said a necropsy will be performed to help authorities understand the cause of the moose's decline and to provide more information on threats to the large mammals in New York state.

That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AKP via AP) BANGKOK -- Three Thai soldiers on patrol were wounded Saturday when one stepped on a land mine in territory along the border with Cambodia, Thailand’s army announced. The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side.” The Ottawa Convention, also called the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, is an international agreement banning the weapons’ use, and both Thailand and Cambodia have committed to it. A statement from Thailand’s foreign ministry said the incident confirmed the Thai army’s findings “that new land mines are being laid in blatant violation of international law.” It also noted this was the third such incident in less than a month. Winthai Suvaree, charged that Saturday’s mine explosion constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems.” A statement issued in response by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied Thailand’s allegation that Cambodia had laid new mines. “We have not, and will not, plant new land mines,” said the statement, noting that Cambodia is a party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty Convention, “and has an internationally recognized record of removing, not deploying, these indiscriminate weapons." It noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970.

Britain’s unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in the three months through May, the highest level in four years, signaling that previous tax increases and uncertainty about the global economy are weighing on employers.

Article: Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades Crown-of-thorns starfish are seen at Tern Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef in far North Queensland, Australia, on Jan. (Australian Institute of Marine Science via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say. But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths — caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change — have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday. The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world’s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said. Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest — and fourth ever recorded — mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world’s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. Coral reefs are considered a “unique and threatened system” due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. That report said “tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.” The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s “suggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.” “Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.

Article: Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir, accusing them of promoting a "false narrative" and "secessionism." SRINAGAR, India -- Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir that they say propagate “false narratives” and “secessionism” in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019. It said such books played “a critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.” The action was taken following “investigations and credible intelligence” about “systemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature” that was “often disguised as historical or political commentary,” it said. A year earlier to that, police arrested a college lecturer on charges he gave his students an English exam filled with questions attacking a crackdown on demonstrations challenging Indian rule in the region. “It only exposes the insecurities and limited understanding of those behind such authoritarian actions, and the contradiction in proudly hosting the ongoing Book Festival.” Banning books is not common in India, but authorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have increasingly raided independent media houses, jailed journalists and sought to re-write history in school and university textbooks to promote the Hindu nationalist vision of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: Texas Democrats have prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump Texas Democrats who left state prevent vote, for now, on Trump's efforts to add GOP House seats State Reps. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. The Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. “We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the Democrats “un-Texan.” “Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said. Hours after Monday's halted House session, a gaggle of Democrats — state lawmakers who left and members of Congress whose lines would be redrawn — mocked Abbott as the weak figure in this battle.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions.

Article: (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) When Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to try to prevent the Republican-led Legislature from redrawing the state's congressional districts, it marked the latest episode in a long national history of gerrymandering. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: “The Constitution supplies no objective measure for assessing whether a districting map treats a political party fairly.” The Supreme Court noted that partisan gerrymandering claims could continue to be decided in state courts under their own constitutions and laws. In a 2023 case from Alabama, the high court said the congressional districts drawn by the state's Republican-led Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting strength of Black residents.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

Article: Republican Nate Morris warmed up a recent crowd of party faithful by gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey Mitch McConnell's legacy comes under fire in Kentucky race to replace him in the Senate Tech entrepreneur Nate Morris, a candidate for United States Senate, talks with reporters at the annual Fancy Farm picnic Saturday, Aug. -- Republican Nate Morris had deftly warmed up a crowd of party faithful, gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey — from hardscrabble childhood to wealthy entrepreneur — when he turned his attention to the man he wants to replace, Sen. While bashing Kentucky's longest-serving senator at a GOP dinner on the eve of Saturday's Fancy Farm picnic, a tradition-laden stop on the state's political circuit, Morris was cut off in midsentence by a party activist in the crowd, who noted that McConnell isn't seeking reelection and pointedly asked Morris: “What are you running on?” Morris touted his hard line stance on immigration and defended Trump's tariffs as a boon for American manufacturing. “Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell told a Republican crowd that included Morris at a pre-picnic breakfast in Mayfield. McConnell endorsed Trump in 2024, but in a biography by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, released shortly before the election, McConnell described him as “a despicable human being.” Morris, who started a waste management technology company, says the senator has been insufficiently loyal to Trump and allowed festering issues like immigration and the national debt to grow worse during his years in Senate leadership. "It seems, to me, maybe just maybe, Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago." McConnell had his customary front-row seat for much of the event but wasn't there for Morris' remarks.

Article: (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) FILE - Bill Clinton, Founder and Board Chair of the Clinton Foundation & 42nd President of the United States, speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative, on Monday, Sept. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) Former President Bill Clinton plans big changes for this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting “by necessity” to address the changing landscape for global development and increasing needs driven by war and climate disasters. “We need to redefine how we show up, how we work, and how we find ways to honor our common humanity,” Clinton wrote in a letter to the CGI community released Thursday. “This September, our goal will be to connect dots across issues, expose the consequences, and confront the complicated issues in front of us.” Since its launch in 2005, the CGI annual meeting has served as a platform for political, business and philanthropic leaders to announce new initiatives or new financial support for existing programs addressing the world’s problems. At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women’s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better. This year’s meeting — held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton — will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. “This year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.” In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI hopes to close those gaps with a series of “Leaders Stage Sessions,” where representatives from a wide range of organizations – including GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan, Center for Disaster Philanthropy CEO Patricia McIlreavy, AFL-CIO President, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten -- will work together to create new initiatives. “Now is the time to stand up and roll up our sleeves — and do our part to reverse the trend lines and begin charting a brighter future,” Clinton said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump holds up the signed document after signing the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency, in the East Room of the White House, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

Claudio Lavenia | Getty Images "Loud luxury" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out "quiet luxury" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. "We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment," Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last month. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus." The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piano have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags. "There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance," Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email. Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench. Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was "reigniting brand desire" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as "a luxury brand with broad universal appeal."

Wwd | Getty Images Gucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label. Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a "first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. "Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again." New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Venetta and the famously out-there Versace. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time," group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month. The big divide Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand.

Article: — Stetson Bennett passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns in a strong start to the preseason, leading the Los Angeles Rams to a 31-21 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday night in new Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer's debut. Blake Corum rushed for short TDs to cap the Rams' first two offensive drives behind Bennett, the two-time national champion at the University of Georgia attempting to secure his job as the Rams' third-string quarterback for another season. Looking much sharper than he did a year ago against the Cowboys, Bennett went 16 for 24 and hit Cody Schrader and Brennan Presley for touchdowns in the second half. Joe Milton passed for 143 yards before injuring his elbow in the fourth quarter of a solid debut with the Cowboys, throwing a touchdown pass to Rivaldo Fairweather with 8:48 to play. The Rams didn't even play second-string quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo — but Matthew Stafford, who didn't participate in training camp due to a back injury, went through a lengthy workout before the game ahead of his anticipated return to practice Monday. Schotty starts The game was the head coaching debut for the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant coach with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Although he has no intention of showing much of his offensive tendencies in the preseason to start his first year as Dallas' play-caller, Schottenheimer got right to work in the other privileges of his new job: He unsuccessfully challenged a sideline catch by the Rams' Xavier Smith on a 39-yard pass from Bennett on the game's opening drive. Offensive interference Lamb didn’t stay out of the action entirely despite being in street clothes: He got a penalty in the second quarter when an official ran into him as he strayed into the white paint on the sideline.

Article: WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country's safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. A crackdown came after an assault The catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.

Monarez said Friday that she was “heartbroken by today’s attack.” In a letter to employees on Saturday, Monarez said that “Monday will be a remote workday for all employees in order for us to conduct a security assessment before returning to the office.” “Law enforcement is still assessing damage to CDC buildings, but it is a relief to report that no CDC employees or visitors were harmed, and we are grateful for the swift response of CDC Security and local law enforcement,” she said. Asked if it was believed that the shooter targeted the CDC, Dickens said Friday the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that he could not say more about a possible motive. He referred to the suspect as “a known person that may have some interests in certain things, that I can’t reiterate right know with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.” A neighbor of the suspect, who said she knew him very well and requested anonymity, told NBC News that White had expressed anti-vaccine sentiments to her on multiple occasions.

One extreme case: Irena Green of Florida had to spend a week in jail in May after minor HOA violations snowballed into a lawsuit, then into a warrant for her arrest. In Texas last summer, at least one resident was getting brown lawn warnings from her HOA while also receiving reminders from her utility company not to exceed water limits—both of which carried potential fines. Homegrown efforts to redo lawns so they need less water also haven’t gone over well—even when local governments encourage it: A Long Island village recently tried to sue one of its residents for $2,000 after she used her town’s $350 native plants grant to re-wild her yard, which the village mayor called “hideous.” (They compromised with a 4-foot cap on the garden’s height.) Clover and moss are becoming more popular as low-maintenance grass lawn alternatives, but HOAs usually categorize them as weeds that could warrant a fine.

Changing landscape An increasing number of communities are trying to keep gas-powered leaf blowers off the streets, according to USA Today: California has a statewide ban on selling them, though many cities there take it a step further and prohibit using them at all. On the flip side, Texas and Florida have passed statewide laws to prevent gas-powered leaf blowers from being banned, ensuring your right to have an emergency back-up Ghostbuster costume this Halloween.

Article: Europe allies say Ukraine peace talks must include Kyiv 31 minutes ago Share Save Stuart Lau BBC News Share Save EPA Macron, Zelensky and Starmer held a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv in May European allies have rallied behind Ukraine in a renewed surge of support, insisting that any peace talks with Russia must include Kyiv. "The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine," said a joint statement issued by the leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland and the European Commission. Late on Saturday, a White House official said that Trump would be willing to hold a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky - but for now, it remains just the two of them, as initially requested by the Russian leader. Trump has previously suggested that he could start by meeting only with Putin, telling reporters he planned to "start off with Russia." But the US president also said that he believed "we have a shot at" organising a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky. Whether Putin would agree to this is unclear - he has refused several opportunities to hold direct talks, and the two leaders have not met face-to-face since Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago. Speaking on Friday, Trump also suggested that there "will be some swapping of territories" in order for Moscow and Kyiv to reach an agreement - to which Zelensky reacted strongly. still impose the idea of 'exchanging' Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing but more convenient positions for the Russians to resume the war," he added defiantly. CBS, the BBC's US media partner, has reported that the White House is trying to sway European allies to accept an agreement that would include Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, and keeping the Crimean Peninsula.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Sponsor Message CDC shooter identified The Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter, but authorities haven't said whether he was killed by police or killed himself. "This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia." Kennedy reaches out to staff "We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose," Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." toggle caption Mike Stewart/AP Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a "Dear colleagues" email, and called for his resignation. Sponsor Message "Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC's workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust," said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration. Opponents say officials' rhetoric contributed Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. "When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains." A request for comment from Vought's agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the "physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers," said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. Sponsor Message Nancy Hoalst, who lives on the same street as White's family, said he seemed like a "good guy" while doing yard work and walking dogs for neighbors, but he would bring up vaccines even in unrelated conversations. "He emphatically believed that." But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: "I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC." Slain officer leaves wife and 3 kids Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and "quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism," DeKalb County said. Growing security concerns Senior CDC leadership told some staff Saturday that they would do a full security assessment following the shooting, according to a conference call recording obtained by the AP. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to "the misinformation, the disinformation" that "caused this issue." It is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted.

Article: In the first six months of the year, real (that is, inflation-adjusted) consumer spending, the main driver behind business cycles and robust economic expansion, barely grew, after rising 3 percent last year. When overall growth falls that sharply, the labor market tends to follow, which is precisely what happened: Job growth, at 35,000 per month on average between May and July, is dangerously close to stall speed. In the ’70s, stagflation was caused not by an unconstrained president but by “exogenous shocks,” meaning big, unexpected disruptions originating from events outside the country and exacerbated by the inaction of the Federal Reserve to offset them.

In announcing the list on Tuesday, the federally appointed government of the Indian-administered region called the works “secessionist literature” that were “disguised as historical or political commentary” but promoted a “culture of grievance, victimhood and terrorist heroism.” The order makes it illegal to circulate, possess or access the texts in the valley, under threat of years in prison.

Article: A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective.” By STEVE PEOPLES Associated Press , LINLEY SANDERS Associated Press , and HYOJIN YOO Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective,” according to a poll that finds considerable pessimism within Democratic ranks. Republicans are more complimentary of their party, although a small but significant share describe the GOP as “greedy” or say it is generally "bad." The poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July reveals warning signs for both major U.S. adults held a dim view of both parties, with about 4 in 10 using negative attributes, including words such as “dishonest” or “stupid." But nearly nine months after Republican Donald Trump won a second presidential term, Democrats appear to be harboring more resentment about the state of their party than do Republicans. About 15% described it using words like “weak," or “apathetic,” while an additional 10% believe it is broadly “ineffective” or "disorganized.” Only about 2 in 10 Democrats described their party positively, with roughly 1 in 10 saying it is “empathetic,” or “inclusive.” An additional 1 in 10 used more general positive descriptors. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to describe their party positively, with many also using straightforward ideological descriptors like “conservative.” About 4 in 10 Republicans used positive attributes to characterize the GOP, making general mentions of words such as “patriotic” or “hardworking,” or offering associations with the word “freedom.” Samuel Washington, 65, of Chicago, said he typically votes Republican. About 2 in 10 Republicans said something negative about the party, including phrases such as “greedy,” “for the rich” or “corrupt.” Republican Dick Grayson, an 83-year-old veteran from Trade, Tennessee, said he is “disappointed” by his party's fealty to Trump. Among other things, he pointed to the price tag of Trump's tax-and-spend package, which will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. He said he is ready for a serious third party to emerge before the next presidential election, pointing to Elon Musk's new “America Party,” which has been slow to launch.

Article: Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine near the Cambodian border on Saturday, the Thai army said, days after the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire halting last month's deadly five-day conflict. One soldier lost a foot and two were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine while patrolling an area between Thailand's Sisaket and Cambodia's Preah Vihear provinces, the army said in a statement. The foreign ministry said Bangkok would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty, to which both are signatories, that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty. The country is a "proud state party" to the Ottawa Convention against landmines and has cleared more than 1 million mines left from decades of war, the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that Thailand's accusations risked undermining the spirit of the ceasefire. Bangkok and Phnom Penh have quarrelled for decades over undemarcated parts of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was its colony. The July 24-28 clashes, the worst fighting between the countries in more than a decade, involved exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties that killed at least 43 and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides. The fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to let observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
