Article: CDC to disburse delayed funds for fighting fentanyl and more, staffers say toggle caption Ben Hendren/Bloomberg/Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available. Sponsor Message NPR reported last month that the Trump administration was withholding $140 million from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S. The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper." Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says Sharon Gilmartin, director of the Safe States Alliance, a national membership association for the field of injury and violence prevention. As an example of the toll, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that laid off staff because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?" There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office of Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more. "What does it all mean?" Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. What does it all mean?" There were whole teams fired during the dramatic reduction in force across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the Rape Prevention and Education Program. Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.

"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation's capital and re-instate pre-existing statues," the National Park Service said in a statement, pointing to President Trump's executive order on Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful and the executive order on Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.

Article: Your call to a local Social Security office may be picked up by someone who can't help toggle caption George Walker IV/AP Phone calls to local Social Security offices are currently being rerouted to other field offices — often to staff who don't have jurisdiction over the caller's case, employees say. Sponsor Message "Under the newly implemented system, calls to local field offices may be routed to available staff at other field offices, regardless of geographic location, to help manage high call volumes." But Angela Digeronimo, a claims specialist in Woodbridge, N.J., and president of a union that represents employees at 25 offices in the state, told NPR this new system creates a "hit or miss" situation for people calling in to their local office. "All SSA field offices are equipped to handle inquiries and resolve issues for callers, irrespective of where a caller lives or where their case originated," the spokesperson said in a statement. "SSA staff across the country have access to the necessary systems and information to assist with a wide range of Social Security matters." Sponsor Message But Amber Westbrook, a local union chapter president and field office employee in the Chicago region, said that's just not how the system works. It's just kind of the way that they retain that to make sure that things are accurate and complete." Westbrook said workers in other field offices may be able to see what's going on with someone's case, but if they're in the wrong jurisdiction they can't "actually take care of the issue." Jen Burdick, a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, said the new phone sharing system is creating a situation where it is taking her group "more time to help people" get and keep Social Security disability benefits. "I feel like perhaps there was good intentions here, but this is ineffective and this is going to waste more people's time, at least when I am rerouted to another office," she said. It's been a whirlwind for people." Nancy Altman — president of Social Security Works, a group that advocates for the expansion of Social Security — said in past administrations officials would have gotten input from every level before implementing a new system. "Then you announce it to the employees and it's only then that you roll it out to the public." Altman said phone sharing is also another example of the agency rolling out a new policy without a heads up to the public and stakeholders, which is forcing advocates and beneficiaries to scramble.

Article: Sean Combs denied bail, will remain in custody until sentencing toggle caption Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images On Monday, a federal judge denied Sean Combs' request to be released on bail pending his sentencing hearing scheduled for Oct. On July 29, Combs' defense attorneys filed a motion for his release on new conditions, including a $50 million bond secured by his Miami residence, where he would reside until the hearing, and turning over his passport to the U.S. In the request, Combs' attorneys argued their client does not pose a danger to the safety of others and there was no legal precedent for keeping Combs in custody solely on the prostitution convictions, otherwise known as the Mann Act. But attitudes about sex and morality have come a long way in the last 115 years." In his response, Judge Arun Subramanian stated that Combs' circumstances had not changed since he was last denied bail following the verdict. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Combs' physical assaulting his ex-girlfriends — including a hotel security footage that showed Combs hitting, kicking and dragging the singer Cassie Ventura — and Combs' defense team conceded that their client had committed domestic violence. "Combs's Mann Act arguments might have traction in a case that didn't involve evidence of violence, coercion, or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three," Judge Arun Subramanian wrote. He addressed the mogul's concerns about conditions within the Metropolitan Detention Center, the jail where he is being held in Brooklyn, but ruled it was not sufficient reason for release. Sponsor Message "As Combs acknowledges, MDC staff has been able to keep him safe and attend to his needs, even during an incident of threatened violence from an inmate," Judge Subramanian wrote.

The payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.” Previous court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air. “It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020. Key false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said. “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.” Broadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs Lou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.” “Yes. Key false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said. Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’” Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion. Broadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani Statements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Key false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.

Key false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said. Key false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said. “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said. “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Article: CNN — A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family. Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

Article: The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” “He’s very highly thought of,” Trump said in June when asked directly about Warsh.

Article: UMM AL-KHAIR, West Bank (AP) — Nearly two dozen Bedouin women, enrobed in black, sat on the floor of a modest hut that baked under the desert sun of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The women are on a hunger strike to call for Israeli authorities to release the body of a beloved community leader killed during a clash with a Jewish settler last week. Israeli authorities said they would only return the body if the family agrees to certain conditions that would “prevent public disorder.” The villagers say those include limiting attendance for a funeral that would normally draw hundreds and burying him at night in a nearby city. Their story won an Oscar, but their suffering continues The plight of Palestinians in this area of the West Bank, known as Masafer Yatta, was featured in “No Other Land,” an Oscar-winning documentary about settler violence and life under Israeli military rule. It documents life in a region where Jewish residents are building new settlements and expanding old ones on hilltops ringing Palestinian villages — all while Israeli military bulldozers arrive frequently to demolish Palestinian homes they say amount to illegal construction. READ MORE: Israeli settlers attack Palestinians and IDF military vehicles in West Bank Witnesses said that the confrontation that led to Al Hathaleen’s death began after settler excavators began digging on village land. The Israeli military said that during the confrontation Palestinians hurled rocks at an Israeli civilian, who opened fire toward the “terrorists.” Levi, a well known settler who is under international sanctions for violence toward Palestinians, was briefly arrested last week. A feeling of complete vulnerability On Monday, a week after Al Hathaleen was killed, Levi was back within eyesight of the village, the sound of his excavators pummeling the ground audible from the hut where the hunger-striking women sat. We don’t know who will be next, or who they will take next.” Most of Umm al-Khair’s residents are related — some closely, some distantly — and nearly all share the surname Hathaleen. “The men are hurt by settlers or taken by the army, put in prison, and are not available.” Three of the women on strike — Al Hathaleen’s mother, sister and widow — have needed medical attention, according to Sara Hathaleen. We just want to live in justice, and in silence.” Hanady Al Hathaleen, 24, said that she will settle for nothing less than a proper burial for her husband in his hometown.

Ukraine invasion triggers crackdown After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as Signal and a few other messaging apps. Last year, authorities raised the cost of obtaining an internet provider license from 7,500 rubles (about $90) to 1 million rubles (over $12,300), and state data shows that more than half of all IP addresses in Russia are managed by seven large companies, with Rostelecom, Russia’s state telephone and internet giant, accounting for 25%. Stanislav Seleznev, cyber security expert and lawyer with the Net Freedom rights group, doesn’t expect ubiquitous prosecutions, since tracking individual online searches in a country of 146 million remains a tall order. Anastasiya Zhyrmont of the Access Now digital rights group said both Telegram and WhatsApp were disrupted in Russia in July in what could be a test of how potential blockages would affect internet infrastructure. It’s been helped by “years of perfecting the technology, years of taking over and understanding the architecture of the internet and the players,” as well as Western sanctions and companies leaving the Russian market since 2022, said Kruope of Human Rights Watch.

Article: CAIRO (AP) — Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of sending Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against the military in the country’s civil war. The foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that the Sudanese government has “irrefutable evidence” confirming mercenaries from Colombia and some neighboring African countries were sponsored and financed by Emirati authorities. “This unprecedented phenomenon poses a serious threat to peace and security in the region and across the continent,” the foreign ministry said, asserting that hundreds of thousands of mercenaries were hired from across the African continent. In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, the UAE’s foreign affairs ministry said the government “categorically rejects” the allegations and denied involvement in the war by backing armed groups. “The UAE emphasizes that these claims are merely attempts to derail the peace process and evade the moral, legal, and humanitarian obligations to end the conflict and pave the way for a transitional process that reflects the aspirations of the Sudanese people for security, stability and development,” the statement by the ministry’s media office added. A spokesperson for the Emirati government said at the time that the UAE was the “target of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at undermining our foreign policy, regional role and humanitarian efforts.” Sudan’s army and the RSF both have been accused of committing atrocities like ethnic cleansing, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence against civilians, including children.

Article: KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours — has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccine sparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Documents show yearslong problems on polio vaccination teams Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. READ MORE: UN: Taliban suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Critics point to continued use of the oral polio vaccine Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world’s southernmost fishery. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit. The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill’s Omega-3 rich oil – for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements — have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill — until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.

About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty — companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L’Oréal — support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The State Department says it supports provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment. “If the negotiations are to succeed, the agreement must be aimed at protecting the environment from plastic pollution, and the agreement should recognize the importance plastics play in our economies,” the State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press. Tracey Campbell, an executive vice president at the plastics and chemicals company LyondellBasell and vice chair of the executive committee of the World Plastics Council, said she’ll ask negotiators to “find a way to agree on a few things and get started” and then build from there.

Article: BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO has started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($578 million). Sweden also announced Tuesday it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts. European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, estimates that as of June, European countries had provided 72 billion euros ($83 billion) worth of military aid since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, compared to $65 billion in U.S. READ MORE: Kyiv mourns after deadliest attack in a year kills 31 people in Ukraine, including 5 children Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said that “American air defense systems and munitions, in particular, are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself.” Announcing the deliveries Monday, he said Russia’s attacks are “pure terror, intended to break Ukraine.” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the Netherlands, posting on social media that “Ukraine, and thus the whole of Europe, will be better protected from Russian terror.” He said the deliveries are coming “at a time when Russia is trying to scale up its strikes. is “going to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they’ll be doing what they want, but I guess it’s for the most part working with Ukraine.” Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Kirsten Grieshaber and David Keyton in Berlin contributed to this report.

Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Putin, has apparently sought to curry favor with his mentor by making provocative statements and frequently lobbing nuclear threats. he responded to Trump’s deadline for Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine or face sanctions by warning him against “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and declaring that “each new ultimatum is a threat and a step toward war.” WATCH: Ex-CIA analyst challenges Trump’s attempt to discredit Russian election interference probe Medvedev also commented on the Foreign Ministry’s statement, describing Moscow’s withdrawal from the moratorium as “the result of NATO countries’ anti-Russian policy.” “This is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with,” he wrote on X. Putin has praised the Oreshnik’s capabilities, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at speeds up to Mach 10 are immune to being intercepted and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.

But Slatkine said the steep tariff level could be aimed to send Switzerland’s Big Pharma — epitomized by Roche and Novartis — a message that it too could come under pressure. The trip comes a day after Switzerland’s executive branch, the Federal Council, held an extraordinary meeting and said it was “keen to pursue talks with the United States on the tariff situation,” the government statement Tuesday said.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s Supreme Court on Monday ordered the house arrest for former President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election — a case that has gripped the South American country as it faces a trade war with the Trump administration. They said his words “good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom” — broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro — cannot “be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.” The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X that the Trump administration “condemns (de) Moraes’ order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.” “Putting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro’s ability to defend himself in public is not a public service. The case against Bolsonaro Brazil’s prosecutors accuse Bolsonaro of heading a criminal organization that plotted to overturn the election, including plans to kill Lula and Justice de Moraes after the far-right leader narrowly lost his reelection bid in 2022. Monday’s order followed one from the top court last month that ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and imposed a curfew on his activities while the proceedings are underway.

De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with “a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary” — likely a veiled reference to Trump’s support for Bolsonaro. On Monday, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs called the Brazilian justice “a U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser” and accused him of using “institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy.” De Moraes said in his decision that “(Brazil’s) judiciary will not allow a defendant to make a fool out of it.” “Justice is the same for all. Possible trouble ahead Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro’s house arrest opens a new moment for the country’s opposition, which will could gather steam in fighting against Lula’s reelection bid next year. “One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,” the analyst said. Lula was imprisoned for 580 days between 2018 and 2019 in a corruption conviction that was later tossed out by the Supreme Court, citing the bias of the judge in the case. Michel Temer, who became president after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016, was arrested for 10 days in 2019 in connection with a graft investigation, which later ended without a conviction.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department on Tuesday for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and other former top officials. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation. Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein — and who else could have been involved. Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee nodded to that line of questioning last month by initiating the subpoenas for the Clintons, both Democrats, as well as demanding all communications between President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein.

Article: Tom Lehrer, a social and political satirist who amassed a devoted following in the 1950s and 1960s for routines featuring blithely subversive musical numbers such as “So Long Mom (A Song for World War III),” “National Brotherhood Week” and “The Vatican Rag,” died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lehrer — an Ivy League mathematics teacher who spent his early academic career on the periphery of show business — created a repertoire of songs that subverted saccharine clichés about romance, patriotism and small-town life when they weren’t skewering the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America or the U.S. “All the world seems in tune/ On a spring afternoon/ When we’re poisoning pigeons in the park,” he warbled to the one-two-three of a tinkling waltz titled “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.” Sentimentality was Mr. Get in line in that processional Advertisement Step into that small confessional There, the guy who’s got religion’ll Tell you if your sin’s original His astute social commentary, verbal dexterity and often academic subject matter differentiated him from mere novelty acts. His song “National Brotherhood Week” was a send-up of platitudes about racial conciliation during bloody civil rights encounters and famously envisioned Black singer and civil rights activist Lena Horne and segregationist Alabama sheriff James Clark dancing cheek to cheek. Lehrer was not the only social satirist of the post-World War II period — Stan Freberg and Mort Sahl were contemporaries, and it was the heyday of Mad magazine — but he is the only one still widely known. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Many of his topics, among them the military-industrial complex, the threat of nuclear Armageddon, xenophobia and environmental catastrophe, still resonate with pointed lyrics about moral ambiguity and ethical compromise. His ballad “Wernher von Braun,” focused on the Nazi Germany missile scientist who later worked for NASA: “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?’/‘That’s not my department,’ says Wernher von Braun.” All four of the LPs that Mr. Lehrer made in the 1950s and 1960s are still in print, with one, 1964’s “That Was the Year That Was,” earning a gold record a remarkable 31 years after its release. Demento’s radio show, the first being another avowed Lehrer fan, “Weird Al” Yankovic.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Thomas Andrew Lehrer was born April 9, 1928, in Manhattan, where his father was a necktie manufacturer. He described himself as “Jewish by ancestry — more to do with the delicatessen than the synagogue.” He began studying classical piano at 7 but soon abandoned it in favor of learning the popular songs of the day. His most-cited musical influence was entertainer Danny Kaye, whose delivery in “Tchaikovsky” — a rhyming list of 50 Russian composers recited at breakneck speed — he quickly learned to imitate. As an undergraduate, he wrote the college fight song send-up “Fight Fiercely, Harvard” (“Albeit they possess the might/ Nonetheless we have the will”) that remained a staple of the university’s football games for decades. Three years later, having realized with some surprise that he had accumulated enough material to make a record, he paid $15 for an hour of studio time and recorded the dozen tunes that comprise “Songs by Tom Lehrer” in one sitting. Lehrer told The Washington Post in 1982, “I was often accused of bad taste in the ’50s and ’60s, but the songs which prompted that accusation seem positively genial today.” He was a peculiarly 1950s figure — a well-mannered iconoclast, the antiestablishment figure operating within the establishment. Advertisement In addition to teaching at Harvard, Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — at one point concurrently — he spent 16 years pursuing a PhD that he never completed, and remained a familiar campus figure even during his brief stint in the limelight. Rather than wait to be drafted, he enlisted in the Army (inspiration for his tune “It Makes a Fellow Proud to be a Soldier”) and worked for the National Security Agency from 1955 to 1957. Lehrer was famously ambivalent about performing, and many factors influenced his decision to quit: He eschewed the “anonymous affection” offered by audiences and took a cynical view of his function as an entertainer. In 1964, he was hired to write topical tunes for the short-lived NBC program “That Was the Week That Was.” He did not perform on the show, whose regulars included David Frost, Buck Henry and Alan Alda; his songs were sung on the air by folk singer Nancy Ames. Lehrer complained that the show’s producers took out all the best lines and replaced them with “something vapid,” so the following year he performed them himself on his third and final album, “That Was the Year That Was.” Many of his most trenchant songs hail from this period: “The Folk Song Army,” “Send the Marines” and “National Brotherhood Week.” Mr. Lehrer’s career took an unpredictable turn in 1970, when his Harvard friend Joe Raposo tapped him to write 10 songs for the Children’s Television Workshop show “The Electric Company.” Today the best-known of these is “Silent E” (Who can turn a cub into a cube?/ Who can turn a tub into a tube?). Lehrer — who never married and ascribed the fact to his short attention span — began to divide his time between Cambridge and Santa Cruz, California, where he joined the University of California at Santa Cruz faculty. He spent January through June in California, teaching, among other things, mathematics to liberal arts students, a class he jokingly referred to as “Math for Tenors.” He also taught a popular course in the history of musical theater. The production, a modest success that was later performed in New York, occasioned a burst of “Where Is He Now?” press coverage — a burst that was repeated in 2000, when Rhino Entertainment released a comprehensive three-disc box set of Mr. Writing in the liner notes to the 1997 compilation “Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer,” he said, “If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.” Sophia Nguyen contributed to this report.

Family members for Angela Clay said in statements that they had waited more than three decades for the execution and regretted that Black had not taken responsibility for his crimes. During the briefing, media witnesses reported seeing Black exhibit signs of distress such as sighing heavily, panting and raising and lowering his head around 10:34 a.m., after the intravenous flow began. Advertisement “It was unanimous among all of us that he was in distress, and we heard him in distress,” said Nashville Banner editor Steve Cavendish, one of the media witnesses. Attorneys for Black had petitioned to force the TDOC to deactivate Black’s cardiac implantable electronic device shortly before his lethal injection, arguing that it could prolong his death by delivering painful shocks to his heart to try to revive him. After Nashville General Hospital, identified by the prison as the partner medical provider, said it would refuse to participate, the state Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s ruling, allowing Black’s execution to move forward. Advertisement Paul Litton, who previously taught bioethics and is dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, told The Post last week that cases like Black’s are an ethical quandary for medical providers. Major health care associations like the American Medical Association and the American Society of Anesthesiologists generally oppose their members taking part in executions, but some health care workers might be willing to participate if they can spare a prisoner additional suffering, Litton said. Even without the ethical issues raised by the deactivating the heart implant, Henry said that under current standards, Black would not even be on death row given his intellectual disability.

Investigation of debris from the Titan showed a failure of the adhesive that glued the craft’s carbon fiber hull to titanium segments at the front and back of the sub, according to the report. The CEO of a submersible manufacturing company deemed a prototype of the Titan “amateurish” after inspecting it in 2019, he testified, and an engineering contractor who worked with OceanGate said the company had a culture of “safety theater” and often dismissed concerns from experts. OceanGate’s own director of marine operations frequently raised safety concerns to other company leaders about the Titan sub but was fired by Rush in 2018, the Coast Guard report said. An OSHA investigator assigned to the case said he faced a backlog of complaints at the time, and OSHA never began an investigation into OceanGate, according to the Coast Guard report. Other sub operators and former OceanGate employees also testified that the company tried to skirt federal regulations by designating Titan passengers as “mission specialists.” In reality, the “mission specialists” performed no specialized work and in fact paid to be on the sub.

Article: “I kind of have the attitude of: If somebody else can do it, you know, why can’t I?” Case in point: After failing to finish a 135-mile race within the time limit three years ago, and limping across the finish line from cramps, Becker figured he would never accomplish his goal of becoming the event’s oldest finisher. “And I absolutely fell in love with it.” Becker ran the mile competitively for his high school track team but didn’t get into running as an adult until 2002, when his friends invited him to a marathon in Duluth, Minnesota, thinking it would be a fun get-together. After Becker ran about 100 miles in the Florida Keys in 2007 — taking him roughly 28 hours — he turned the route into an ultramarathon he founded called the KEYS100. When he wasn’t near steep hills, Becker simulated them by dragging an SUV tire from a rope tied around his waist — an idea he said was bizarre when an endurance running trainer, Lisa Smith-Batchen, taught it to him. Advertisement One of Becker’s favorite races came in November 2016, when he ran about 100 miles in southwest China, near the same area his late father, Mickey, fought Japanese soldiers while serving in the U.S. In July 2022, Becker ran the Badwater Ultramarathon, which starts at eastern California’s Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, and ends 135 miles later at Whitney Portal, which leads to Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States. Smith-Batchen and three of Becker’s friends followed him during the July race in a black Cadillac Escalade, giving him energy gels, milk chocolate-flavored Ensure and iced bandannas, and spraying cold water onto his back.

Article: AKRON, Ohio — Alexis Martin, a prominent antitrafficking activist, was ordered released from prison Monday following more than a decade of lobbying from advocates, legislators and celebrities, who argued courts should do more to protect, rather than punish, child trafficking survivors who commit crimes related to their abuse. An Ohio judge’s decision to suspend Martin’s sentence and free her on judicial release was the result of an agreement in which Martin pleaded guilty to lesser charges, including involuntary manslaughter, for her role in the death of her alleged abuser when she was 15. It’s now time for us to have you in the presence of individuals who will help you make good decisions,” said Judge Joy Malek Oldfield of the Summit County Common Pleas Court. Martin had already served more than 11½ years and might not have had the same support services available to her in the future if her time in prison were prolonged, Oldfield said. But rather than have her original sentence thrown out entirely, the state placed Martin under parole supervision for at least 14 years, equal to the minimum remainder of her sentence. “As a former prosecutor handling these cases, it just seemed wrong that she would be punished like she was.” Advertisement Advertisement Martin’s defense had argued that Martin would not be subject to a similar judgment and sentence if she were tried today given the increased understanding prosecutors and police have around the effects of trafficking on victims who commit crimes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “It’s not that I want revenge, but this is my family’s truth: Every birthday, every holiday, every ordinary day there’s something missing,” Dennis, 36, told The Post on the eve of the hearing. In court Monday, Dennis was joined by her brother, Alecio Samuel — who was shot in the head during the 2013 incident that killed his brother — and mother, Marjorie Rumph, who all pleaded with Oldfield not to release Martin, whom they described as manipulative and dangerous. Advertisement Advertisement Clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, Martin spoke in a quiet but steady voice as she accepted responsibility for her role in Kerney’s death and said she was committed to rebuilding her life. “But in the time that I’ve served, I’ve changed the reckless adolescent mindset that I had.” “I want to help society so that no little girl or teen is ever in my position.” Martin’s case was the subject of a 2022 Washington Post investigation that found officials failed to afford the teen the protections of Ohio’s “safe harbor” law, which is meant to direct child sex trafficking victims into supportive services, and in most cases, eventually dismiss the charges against them. Advertisement Such laws have become increasingly common as antitrafficking advocates have pushed officials to recognize that minors forced into commercial sex are frequently arrested for crimes they commit at the direction of — or to escape — their traffickers. The teen told police that Kerney was her “pimp,” and that she had helped orchestrate the robbery, saying, “I set my dad up.” Judges later acknowledged there was evidence Martin was being sold by Kerney. “People have watched this case closely because there was a sense that justice was not done in her case, that she was not treated as a victim of human trafficking,” said Sally Duffy, who sits on the board of the U.S. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now, Martin is planning to complete her transition program in Franklin County, where she will spend at least the next 18 months living, working and receiving counseling and services through Amethyst House, a recovery center for survivors of sex trafficking and drug addiction. Martin will be supervised by CATCH Court, a trauma-informed subdivision of the Franklin County Municipal Court designed to address the needs of defendants who have experienced prostitution and sex trafficking.

Article: Pregnant veterans would no longer be allowed to receive abortions at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnancy threatens their health under a proposed rule from the Trump administration that would revoke a Biden-era policy expanding abortion access. Months after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022, the Biden administration implemented a rule change allowing VA for the first time to provide abortion services for veterans and eligible family members in limited circumstances, including in states with abortion bans. Thus, VA said, the policy change was “essential.” In its filing Friday, the Trump administration called the 2022 rule change “inappropriate” and “legally questionable.” The Trump team’s move to once again restrict abortion access has received praise from conservatives who staunchly oppose federal funding for abortion services of any kind. Advertisement Lindsay Church, executive director of Minority Veterans of America, which pushed against the proposal, worries that if the new abortion rule takes effect, it would push veterans away from receiving health care through VA. I would go anywhere else.” A VA spokesperson called the Biden-era policy “politically motivated.” Trump’s proposed rule, which is open for a 30-day public comment period that started Monday, would bring VA “back in line with historical norms,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Advertisement When the Biden administration expanded abortions through VA, it was among the few strategies officials could leverage to protect access to the procedure after the high court overturned Roe v. The VA rule mirrored the policy of the Defense Department, which can perform or pay for abortions for service members and their beneficiaries only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. The Biden-era VA said in 2022 that it was “unconscionable” that veterans did not have access to “these same critical services following their transition to civilian life.” The policy was geared toward veterans living in states hostile to abortion, especially in the South, the region that most severely restricted abortion access after Roe fell.

Article: The technology behind that — “Drone as First Responder,” or DFR — has skyrocketed in popularity among police departments nationwide since the Federal Aviation Administration streamlined the process for agencies to adopt the program this spring. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “When you have a camera in the sky that can see things that police officers can’t normally see, that offers a huge potential for privacy invasion,” said Beryl Lipton, a senior researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. One of the hardest aspects of policing is that in calls for service, “we don’t have crystal balls, we don’t know what we’re going into,” said Roxana Kennedy, chief of the police department in Chula Vista, California. There is no public list of law enforcement agencies that have adopted the programs, and gray areas around what constitutes a DFR versus a different kind of drone program makes creating a definitive count difficult. Advertisement The FAA has approved waivers for at least 300 agencies to adopt drone first-responder programs so far this year, according to Werner, who said he meets regularly with representatives of the federal regulatory agency. Advertisement Advertisement “The FAA made the review process faster by removing duplicate steps and giving first responders updated guidance on how to submit waiver requests,” an FAA spokesperson said in an unsigned statement to The Washington Post. They don’t need to be within an officer’s line of sight, which is why they require a special waiver from the FAA as part of a regulatory process meant to prevent collisions and other hazards. The incident that “changed everything” for Kennedy, she said, was when a drone responded in 2019 to a call about a man who appeared to be erratically waving a gun. Advertisement “Drones and aerial cameras could be used to surveil political protests, and it could even be deployed for other purposes to see who is seeking health care in California from another state, or used to track who’s coming and going at an immigration courthouse,” said Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. “So the idea that we should all be assured that law enforcement is just saying, ‘Don’t worry, it’s only for a narrow purpose’ flies in the face of what’s happened historically.” Advertisement Advertisement In Chula Vista, a lawsuit filed by a local newspaper publisher seeks to force the police department to release the drone video footage collected in one month of 2021. Privacy advocates say police departments may promise to use the DFRs only to respond to calls for service or certain kinds of emergencies, but once the technology is out of the bottle, it will be hard to put it back in. Advertisement Advertisement Skydio, a DFR manufacturer, works with agencies to help develop policies surrounding drone use, “and more importantly, how they do not intend on using drones,” said Noreen Charlton, the senior manager of public safety marketing at the firm. In Redmond, the city’s policy “prohibits the department from using drones for general surveillance, harassing or discriminating against individuals or groups, or conducting personal business.” But those concerned about excessive surveillance remain skeptical. Part of that, she said, could involve “annual reviews by the city council and public meetings to discuss what reasons the surveillance tools were used for and whether there were any violations.” In the same vein, independent oversight bodies and local government could help assuage some of the concerns by imposing strict limits on the programs, said Jay Stanley, a privacy and technology policy analyst at the ACLU.

In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked. Another lawsuit concerns the termination of the agency’s funding for 56 state and territorial humanities councils, which by law are entitled to a portion of the agency’s funding, which they use to support local projects, including many in rural areas.

Article: The real reason weather forecasters (like me) often appear to get it wrong 5 minutes ago Share Save Carol Kirkwood Lead weather forecaster Share Save BBC Sometimes I'll be walking around a supermarket, and a shopper will approach me in the aisle. Despite great strides in the accuracy of forecasting, there are still gaps in public trust Liz Bentley, a professor of meteorology at Reading University and chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, says that a one-day forecast is correct over 90% of the time. When YouGov asked British adults last summer whether they trusted the weather forecast, a substantial minority - 37% - said they didn't trust it "very much" or "at all." (Reassuringly, 61% said they did trust forecasters like me.) Jokes about the forecast are widespread. The 2012 Olympics opening ceremony included a clip of the moment from 1987, when the weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry because there wouldn't be a hurricane - only for a storm to hit hours later. AFP via Getty Images In the summer months in particular, viewers pay huge attention to the weather forecast Another part of the challenge is how that wealth of information is boiled down and communicated. It's difficult to condense the masses of data into a snappy, digital app-friendly predictions Every day, across the British Isles, forecasters collect "observations" (or data) on things like temperature and wind speed, through a network of more than 200 "weather stations" run by the Met Office. Chaos Theory: when weather goes wrong The atmosphere is known as a "chaotic system", meaning that a slight error - even as small as 0.01C - in the initial observations can produce a drastically different result. A slight error in the data - even as small as 0.01C - in the initial observations can produce a drastically different result In the 1990s, a weather event needed to be larger than about 100 miles (161km) before it could be fully observed - now, the UK-wide weather model used by the Met Office can map weather events as small as 2 miles (3km), Prof Bentley says. "It's as complex as nuclear fusion physics, but most of us don't experience that day to day, and so we don't have to come up with a way to communicate that science to the public." One cause of confusion is when different weather providers appear to show different forecasts - Carol Kirkwood explains why this happens It's also easy to forget that forecasting is just that - predicting. In this style, forecasters could say things like, "What we're seeing now is similar to what we saw at a certain event a few years ago' - something within memory." Getty Images More creativity is needed in communicating the weather, according to some experts - one has suggested a "storyline approach" This is partly why the Met Office, in 2015, decided to name storms. "Because they've had that information given to them so often, they kind of get it." The new weather super predictor Weather forecasting could soon change dramatically with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In 1987, weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry because there wouldn't be a hurricane - only for a storm to hit hours later But Prof Bentley identifies a weakness in AI-driven weather models: they are fed with reams of historic data, and trained to spot patterns - which in her view makes it very difficult to predict events that haven't happened yet. But if AI is always looking backwards, it will never see 41 because we've not had it yet." Prof Turner accepts that this is a challenge with AI models like his and says his team is working on remedies. "Do you put something on [a weather app] that says, 'If you're planning a barbecue, then you might want to do it at lunchtime because the chances are you're going to get washed out in the afternoon'?" This chimes with a trend I've noticed from my own career: a growing interest in understanding the science behind the weather. Carol Kirkwood has been a weather forecaster for 30 years and has observed a change in what viewers want Viewers are no longer just interested in knowing whether there'll be a heatwave; they want to know why.

Trump has tried to lessen some of the questions and criticism on the issue by lobbying for the release of grand jury testimony connected to Epstein, who died in prison while waiting to go on trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In a court filing submitted on Tuesday, Maxwell's lawyers pushed back against the government's attempt to make the transcripts public, arguing it could negatively impact her efforts to have the Supreme Court review her case.

A lawyer for the government, Nicole O’Connor, argued at a hearing in July that the funds can be used both for disaster recovery and disaster prevention and that FEMA should have discretion to use the money how it sees fit. READ MORE: Why older rural Americans can be hit hardest after floods and other disasters “There is an inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and the potential hardship accruing to the States from the funds being repurposed is great,” Stearns wrote. “The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives.” The program has provided grants for a range of disaster management projects, including strengthening electrical grids, constructing levees for flood protection and relocating vulnerable water treatment facilities. FEMA said in a news release in April that it was “ending” the program, but the agency’s acting chief, David Richardson, later said in a court filing that FEMA was merely evaluating whether to end or revise it. Stearns said it appeared FEMA had decided to end the program and was “inching towards a fait accompli,” noting it had cancelled new funding opportunities and told stakeholders they shouldn’t expect any unobligated funding.

Article: Zara ads banned for 'unhealthily thin' models 47 minutes ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards • @edwardsclm Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Zara Two adverts by fashion brand Zara have been banned for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said shadows and a slick back bun hairstyle made one model appear "gaunt" while the pose and low cut design of a shirt in another image showed the model's "protruding" collarbones. The watchdog ruled that the "irresponsible" adverts must not appear again in their current form and that Zara must ensure all its images were "prepared responsibly." Zara has removed the adverts and said that both models in question had medical certification proving they were in good health when the pictures were taken. It also said the positioning of her upper arms and elbow joints made her look "out of proportion." 'Protruding collarbones' Zara The other banned advert was for a shirt and the model was said to be in a position that made "protruding" collarbones a "focal feature" of the advert.

Article: Call for help with school uniform costs in England 38 minutes ago Share Save Dan Whitworth & Dearbail Jordan Reporting from Winsford, Cheshire Share Save Getty Images Few councils offer school uniform support, and one of the UK's largest debt advisers has called on the government to change that Low-income families in England struggling with the cost of school uniform should be offered grants as standard, one of the UK's largest debt advisers has said. The Department for Education (DfE) said it was already changing the law to limit the number of branded items schools can insist on, saving some families over £50 on the back-to-school shop. Money Wellness says of 153 local education authorities in England, just 22 offer a dedicated uniform grant, while a further seven provide help but only in exceptional circumstances such as fire, flooding or being made homeless. But, it said: "The vast majority offer nothing at all." Mr Rolfe said: "We urgently need a consistent, national approach to school uniform support to ensure no child is disadvantaged simply because of where they live." The Local Government Association, the membership group for English councils, said: "While some councils choose to help parents with the cost of school uniforms, funding pressures on council budgets make it increasingly difficult for them to continue these concessionary grants. While pupils in England are still out for the summer, the break finishes in around four weeks' time and the Children's Society charity said now is the time that school uniform banks are starting to get busier. "And Dillon will grow out of them so it is a continual issue really and with Christmas not far off, it is back-to-back for families with costs." Jason, with Amelia, Julie and Bobby, says councils should standardise help with school uniform costs With household bills such as energy, water and council tax rising in April, Mr Rolfe said the costs of the start of the school year was an added financial burden. Jason, who was at the Green Uniform and Baby Bank in Cheshire with his wife Julie and their children Amelia and Bobby, said it was not just low income families who were struggling with costs. Josh, whose daughter Isabella was going into year seven, said the cost of school uniforms was "very high", but he received an email from the school telling him about the bank. There used to be a lot of stigma, it had to be branded but now there's no stigma on that, everyone's in the same boat struggling." And it is a sustainable way to shop, according to Jason: "You're not having uniforms and clothes going to landfill sites". The Green Uniform and Baby Bank's Michelle Hawthorne says it has never been busier Michelle Hawthorne, who helps run a school uniform bank in Winsford, Cheshire, said school uniform costs were an "enourmous" pressure for families. unbearable." A Department for Education spokesperson said: "Our Plan for Change is removing barriers to opportunity, with limits on branded items of school uniform just one of the steps we're taking to put money back into parents' pockets and break the link between background and success."

Article: RFK Jr cancels $500m in mRNA vaccine development in the US Doctors and health experts have criticised Kennedy's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and his debunked views on health policies. The development of mRNA vaccines to target Covid-19 was critical in helping slow down the pandemic and saving millions of lives, said Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official. Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted the flu virus mutates every year regardless of whether people get vaccinated, while the measles virus has not mutated, despite the majority of people being vaccinated with an mRNA shot. HHS said the department that runs the vaccine projects, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), would focus on "platforms with stronger safety records and transparent clinical and manufacturing data practices". In June, he fired all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations, replacing them with some people who have criticized the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

Article: No bullying found in Harry charity row, but blame for all sides Prince Harry left the Sentebale charity that he had co-founded But the commission did criticise "all parties" for allowing a "damaging" dispute to play out publicly - and gave the charity a regulatory action plan to deal with "governance weaknesses". Harry quits charity he set up in Diana's honour over internal row Although Prince Harry's team welcomed the finding that there had not been evidence of bullying, a spokesman said the report "falls troublingly short" in that the "consequences of the current chair's actions will not be borne by her". "Sentebale's problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity's reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity's ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve," said Charity Commission chief executive David Holdsworth. The row had seen Prince Harry accused of being a "toxic" brand by the charity's chair Ms Chandauka - and he had stepped down saying his and the trustees' relationship with her was broken "beyond repair" and saying that they had faced " blatant lies ". Sophie Chandauka says the charity will continue and grow stronger The current chair, Ms Chandauka, remains at the head of the charity, with the watchdog finding no reason for her not to continue. The Charity Commission also said that although there was no evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir [discrimination against black women], it acknowledged a "strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties" and said it wasn't its role as a regulator to adjudicate on individual claims of bullying. "For 19 years, its dedicated staff and steadfast supporters have provided vital care to over 100,000 young people across southern Africa, including young people living with HIV/Aids and those facing mental health challenges," said a spokesman for Prince Harry. Prince Harry's spokesman said the charity had been grown to become a "flowering force for good" and that he will "now focus on finding new ways to continue supporting the children of Lesotho and Botswana". Ms Chandauka said: "Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso." The Charity Commission concluded that those running charities should not let disagreements make them forget their initial good intentions and to focus on those they were trying to help.

"But it's extremely hard to study, because once individuals leave a group, it's hard to keep track of them." Working in partnership with the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, at a field site that has been monitored since 1967, Ms Martignac and her colleagues were able to track those movements. Poring through decades of information on the animals' lives, the scientists followed the "dispersals" of 56 female mountain gorillas - examining which new group they chose to join and why.

Article: Despite Trump's peace calls, Russian attacks on Ukraine double since inauguration 3 hours ago Share Save Matt Murphy & Ned Davies BBC Verify Share Save Reuters Russia has more than doubled the number of drones and missiles fired towards Ukraine since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, a BBC Verify analysis has found, despite his calls for a ceasefire. However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions. The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared to 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term. "This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long," White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. "President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to NATO members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire." In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again. On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: "What the hell happened to him [Putin]?" Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city. "Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live," Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June. "Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that." Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks. "It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites," he said. Justin Bronk, an analyst focussing on the Russian military at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said restrictions on the supply of military equipment imposed by the White House had made Ukraine "vulnerable" to missile and drone attacks. But he also noted that Russia has ramped up the production of missiles and so-called 'kamikaze' drones such as the Geran-2 - a domestically produced version of the Iranian Shahed drone. EPA Russia is said to be producing huge numbers of Geran drones for use against Ukraine Ukraine's Military Intelligence agency (HUR) recently told domestic media that Russia was now producing up to 85 ballistic missiles per month, up from 44 in April 2024. In a recent interview with Russian military TV, the facility's director Timur Shagivaleyev boasted that Alabuga had become "the largest combat drone production plant in the world", adding that his workers were producing nine times more units than initially expected.

Article: Taiwanese TV show imagines Chinese invasion 4 hours ago Share Save Tessa Wong BBC News, Asia Digital Reporter Share Save Watch: Taiwanese TV show explores Chinese invasion scenario A Chinese fighter jet plane crashes in the waters off Taiwan's coast, prompting Chinese warships to blockade the island for a "search and rescue". Showrunner Chen Hsin-mei told the BBC she wanted to make the series to "warn the Taiwanese people that the war is really coming," citing China's rising use of "disinformation campaigns and grey zone warfare to put our society in chaos and make us confused about our identity". Zeroday Cultural and Creative The show depicts "fifth column" Chinese sympathisers stirring up unrest in Taiwan Zero Day Attack's message echoes the rhetoric of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government and its leader President William Lai, who have warned about China's threat and preached the need to raise the island's defences. In recent days Wang Hung-wei, a prominent lawmaker from the opposition Kuomintang party, criticised Zero Day Attack as "selling dried mangoes", a Taiwanese euphemism that means stoking unnecessary fear about the destruction of one's country. While Lai has in the past described himself as a "pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence", he has also insisted Taiwan has no need to formally declare independence because it is already a sovereign nation. "The Taiwanese people can relate to it as it reflects our current situation, the Chinese Communist Party must be repulsed as their tactics have been exposed." Some have praised the first episode, which depicts the invasion quietly beginning amid a contentious presidential election marked by violence and political fighting. Polls show that most Taiwanese do not believe Beijing will attack imminently, and prefer the "status quo" in Taiwan's relationship with China, which means neither unifying with Beijing nor formally declaring independence.

Article: The decision by Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the “Russia Hoax” comes at a time of increasing pressure on the Trump administration to produce more information about the F.B.I.’s files on Jeffrey Epstein. President Trump has urged and browbeaten supporters to shift their obsession from the Jeffrey Epstein files to the investigation and potential prosecution of Democratic officials he accuses of persecuting him, a cardinal grievance that bonds him to his base. Trump, reeling from the angry backlash over its handling of the Epstein case, is now taking its most concrete — if still murky — investigative steps against Trump targets, starting with officials he blames for what he sees as the plot against him: the investigation of his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week authorized prosecutors to investigate the inquiry the president calls the “Russia hoax” and present a case to a grand jury in South Florida if the evidence warrants it, according to people briefed on the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations. But Trump appointees are reluctant to present evidence to a grand jury in the District of Columbia where key decisions in the Russia investigation were made nearly a decade ago. The decision to authorize a grand jury investigation, which could include subpoenas, into the statements and testimony by government officials surrounding the 2016 election suggests the Trump administration has begun turning its rhetoric of revenge into action. Such concerns, however significant, have been swept aside, at least for now, by the eagerness to appease an impatient president demanding to use the vast powers of federal law enforcement to exact vengeance — and the political imperative of making the Epstein fiasco disappear. Many Trump advisers and allies also view the Russia investigation as a gross abuse of power, while some were personally affected by the inquiry and forced to hire lawyers to defend themselves. Trump has privately carped about the slow pace of Justice Department action to his political enemies, according to people in his orbit, and made it unmistakably known what he wanted. Bondi’s order — then celebrated the move to investigate Obama administration national security officials, saying “they deserve it.” The decision also comes as the Trump administration faces increasing pressure to produce more information about the F.B.I.’s files on Mr. The emergence of the grand jury inquiry was unusual in several ways — not least, because its existence was revealed to right-leaning media outlets like Fox News before any actual investigative steps had apparently been taken. Last week, an obscure agency that scrutinizes potential misconduct by or against federal employees, the Office of Special Counsel, took a step in that direction, confirming it was investigating Jack Smith, the former federal prosecutor who oversaw the criminal cases against Mr. Trump, who is marking his first six months in office, would have pushed quite so forcefully for the department to act against his perceived foes if the Epstein case was not still smoldering political fire. Epstein’s interactions with wealthy and powerful friends — are equally if not more enthusiastic about deploying the Justice Department, F.B.I., and intelligence services to uncover what they claim to be a vast decade-long, Democratic-led conspiracy to destroy Mr. Trump’s key congressional allies and some of the most vocal members of his base have been beating the drums for arrests almost from the moment that the bureau and intelligence officials started releasing documents on the Russia investigation last month. On Monday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, posted a message on social media with a “scorecard” showing that no one had been arrested yet for popular MAGA-world bugbears like the “Russia Collusion Hoax,” “Jan. Among the most fervid Trump supporters calling for arrests are the rioters who were charged in connection with — and then granted clemency for — the storming of the Capitol on Jan. “Dear God, has anyone been arrested yet?” wrote one pardoned rioter, Benjamin Martin, who was initially sentenced to 13 months in prison for holding open a door at the Capitol so that others could spray chemicals at the police. Bondi by referring the investigation of the Russian investigation to the Justice Department, claiming a cache of documents she released proved Obama administration officials engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy.” In response, Ms. The claims by Trump supporters that Obama-era officials engaged in a far-reaching conspiracy to undermine his 2016 campaign have already been exhaustively investigated by a special counsel, John Durham, with little to show for it. Durham filed two criminal indictments based on that investigation, one against a private practice lawyer on charges of lying to the F.B.I., and another against a Russia analyst for essentially the same offense.
