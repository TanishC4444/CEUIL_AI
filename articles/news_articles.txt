Article: CDC to disburse delayed funds for fighting fentanyl and more, staffers say toggle caption Ben Hendren/Bloomberg/Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available. Sponsor Message NPR reported last month that the Trump administration was withholding $140 million from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S. The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper." Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says Sharon Gilmartin, director of the Safe States Alliance, a national membership association for the field of injury and violence prevention. As an example of the toll, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that laid off staff because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?" There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office of Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more. "What does it all mean?" Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. What does it all mean?" There were whole teams fired during the dramatic reduction in force across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the Rape Prevention and Education Program. Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.

"The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation's capital and re-instate pre-existing statues," the National Park Service said in a statement, pointing to President Trump's executive order on Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful and the executive order on Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.

Article: Your call to a local Social Security office may be picked up by someone who can't help toggle caption George Walker IV/AP Phone calls to local Social Security offices are currently being rerouted to other field offices — often to staff who don't have jurisdiction over the caller's case, employees say. Sponsor Message "Under the newly implemented system, calls to local field offices may be routed to available staff at other field offices, regardless of geographic location, to help manage high call volumes." But Angela Digeronimo, a claims specialist in Woodbridge, N.J., and president of a union that represents employees at 25 offices in the state, told NPR this new system creates a "hit or miss" situation for people calling in to their local office. "All SSA field offices are equipped to handle inquiries and resolve issues for callers, irrespective of where a caller lives or where their case originated," the spokesperson said in a statement. "SSA staff across the country have access to the necessary systems and information to assist with a wide range of Social Security matters." Sponsor Message But Amber Westbrook, a local union chapter president and field office employee in the Chicago region, said that's just not how the system works. It's just kind of the way that they retain that to make sure that things are accurate and complete." Westbrook said workers in other field offices may be able to see what's going on with someone's case, but if they're in the wrong jurisdiction they can't "actually take care of the issue." Jen Burdick, a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, said the new phone sharing system is creating a situation where it is taking her group "more time to help people" get and keep Social Security disability benefits. "I feel like perhaps there was good intentions here, but this is ineffective and this is going to waste more people's time, at least when I am rerouted to another office," she said. It's been a whirlwind for people." Nancy Altman — president of Social Security Works, a group that advocates for the expansion of Social Security — said in past administrations officials would have gotten input from every level before implementing a new system. "Then you announce it to the employees and it's only then that you roll it out to the public." Altman said phone sharing is also another example of the agency rolling out a new policy without a heads up to the public and stakeholders, which is forcing advocates and beneficiaries to scramble.

Article: Sean Combs denied bail, will remain in custody until sentencing toggle caption Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images On Monday, a federal judge denied Sean Combs' request to be released on bail pending his sentencing hearing scheduled for Oct. On July 29, Combs' defense attorneys filed a motion for his release on new conditions, including a $50 million bond secured by his Miami residence, where he would reside until the hearing, and turning over his passport to the U.S. In the request, Combs' attorneys argued their client does not pose a danger to the safety of others and there was no legal precedent for keeping Combs in custody solely on the prostitution convictions, otherwise known as the Mann Act. But attitudes about sex and morality have come a long way in the last 115 years." In his response, Judge Arun Subramanian stated that Combs' circumstances had not changed since he was last denied bail following the verdict. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Combs' physical assaulting his ex-girlfriends — including a hotel security footage that showed Combs hitting, kicking and dragging the singer Cassie Ventura — and Combs' defense team conceded that their client had committed domestic violence. "Combs's Mann Act arguments might have traction in a case that didn't involve evidence of violence, coercion, or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three," Judge Arun Subramanian wrote. He addressed the mogul's concerns about conditions within the Metropolitan Detention Center, the jail where he is being held in Brooklyn, but ruled it was not sufficient reason for release. Sponsor Message "As Combs acknowledges, MDC staff has been able to keep him safe and attend to his needs, even during an incident of threatened violence from an inmate," Judge Subramanian wrote.

The payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.” Previous court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air. “It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020. Key false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said. “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.” Broadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs Lou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.” “Yes. Key false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said. Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’” Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion. Broadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani Statements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Key false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.

Key false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said. Key false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said. “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said. “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Article: CNN — A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family. Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

Article: The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” “He’s very highly thought of,” Trump said in June when asked directly about Warsh.

Article: UMM AL-KHAIR, West Bank (AP) — Nearly two dozen Bedouin women, enrobed in black, sat on the floor of a modest hut that baked under the desert sun of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The women are on a hunger strike to call for Israeli authorities to release the body of a beloved community leader killed during a clash with a Jewish settler last week. Israeli authorities said they would only return the body if the family agrees to certain conditions that would “prevent public disorder.” The villagers say those include limiting attendance for a funeral that would normally draw hundreds and burying him at night in a nearby city. Their story won an Oscar, but their suffering continues The plight of Palestinians in this area of the West Bank, known as Masafer Yatta, was featured in “No Other Land,” an Oscar-winning documentary about settler violence and life under Israeli military rule. It documents life in a region where Jewish residents are building new settlements and expanding old ones on hilltops ringing Palestinian villages — all while Israeli military bulldozers arrive frequently to demolish Palestinian homes they say amount to illegal construction. READ MORE: Israeli settlers attack Palestinians and IDF military vehicles in West Bank Witnesses said that the confrontation that led to Al Hathaleen’s death began after settler excavators began digging on village land. The Israeli military said that during the confrontation Palestinians hurled rocks at an Israeli civilian, who opened fire toward the “terrorists.” Levi, a well known settler who is under international sanctions for violence toward Palestinians, was briefly arrested last week. A feeling of complete vulnerability On Monday, a week after Al Hathaleen was killed, Levi was back within eyesight of the village, the sound of his excavators pummeling the ground audible from the hut where the hunger-striking women sat. We don’t know who will be next, or who they will take next.” Most of Umm al-Khair’s residents are related — some closely, some distantly — and nearly all share the surname Hathaleen. “The men are hurt by settlers or taken by the army, put in prison, and are not available.” Three of the women on strike — Al Hathaleen’s mother, sister and widow — have needed medical attention, according to Sara Hathaleen. We just want to live in justice, and in silence.” Hanady Al Hathaleen, 24, said that she will settle for nothing less than a proper burial for her husband in his hometown.

Ukraine invasion triggers crackdown After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as Signal and a few other messaging apps. Last year, authorities raised the cost of obtaining an internet provider license from 7,500 rubles (about $90) to 1 million rubles (over $12,300), and state data shows that more than half of all IP addresses in Russia are managed by seven large companies, with Rostelecom, Russia’s state telephone and internet giant, accounting for 25%. Stanislav Seleznev, cyber security expert and lawyer with the Net Freedom rights group, doesn’t expect ubiquitous prosecutions, since tracking individual online searches in a country of 146 million remains a tall order. Anastasiya Zhyrmont of the Access Now digital rights group said both Telegram and WhatsApp were disrupted in Russia in July in what could be a test of how potential blockages would affect internet infrastructure. It’s been helped by “years of perfecting the technology, years of taking over and understanding the architecture of the internet and the players,” as well as Western sanctions and companies leaving the Russian market since 2022, said Kruope of Human Rights Watch.

Article: CAIRO (AP) — Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of sending Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against the military in the country’s civil war. The foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that the Sudanese government has “irrefutable evidence” confirming mercenaries from Colombia and some neighboring African countries were sponsored and financed by Emirati authorities. “This unprecedented phenomenon poses a serious threat to peace and security in the region and across the continent,” the foreign ministry said, asserting that hundreds of thousands of mercenaries were hired from across the African continent. In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, the UAE’s foreign affairs ministry said the government “categorically rejects” the allegations and denied involvement in the war by backing armed groups. “The UAE emphasizes that these claims are merely attempts to derail the peace process and evade the moral, legal, and humanitarian obligations to end the conflict and pave the way for a transitional process that reflects the aspirations of the Sudanese people for security, stability and development,” the statement by the ministry’s media office added. A spokesperson for the Emirati government said at the time that the UAE was the “target of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at undermining our foreign policy, regional role and humanitarian efforts.” Sudan’s army and the RSF both have been accused of committing atrocities like ethnic cleansing, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence against civilians, including children.

Article: KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours — has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccine sparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Documents show yearslong problems on polio vaccination teams Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. READ MORE: UN: Taliban suspended polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Critics point to continued use of the oral polio vaccine Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world’s southernmost fishery. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit. The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill’s Omega-3 rich oil – for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements — have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill — until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.

About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty — companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L’Oréal — support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The State Department says it supports provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment. “If the negotiations are to succeed, the agreement must be aimed at protecting the environment from plastic pollution, and the agreement should recognize the importance plastics play in our economies,” the State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press. Tracey Campbell, an executive vice president at the plastics and chemicals company LyondellBasell and vice chair of the executive committee of the World Plastics Council, said she’ll ask negotiators to “find a way to agree on a few things and get started” and then build from there.

Article: BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO has started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($578 million). Sweden also announced Tuesday it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts. European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, estimates that as of June, European countries had provided 72 billion euros ($83 billion) worth of military aid since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, compared to $65 billion in U.S. READ MORE: Kyiv mourns after deadliest attack in a year kills 31 people in Ukraine, including 5 children Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said that “American air defense systems and munitions, in particular, are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself.” Announcing the deliveries Monday, he said Russia’s attacks are “pure terror, intended to break Ukraine.” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the Netherlands, posting on social media that “Ukraine, and thus the whole of Europe, will be better protected from Russian terror.” He said the deliveries are coming “at a time when Russia is trying to scale up its strikes. is “going to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they’ll be doing what they want, but I guess it’s for the most part working with Ukraine.” Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Kirsten Grieshaber and David Keyton in Berlin contributed to this report.

Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Putin, has apparently sought to curry favor with his mentor by making provocative statements and frequently lobbing nuclear threats. he responded to Trump’s deadline for Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine or face sanctions by warning him against “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and declaring that “each new ultimatum is a threat and a step toward war.” WATCH: Ex-CIA analyst challenges Trump’s attempt to discredit Russian election interference probe Medvedev also commented on the Foreign Ministry’s statement, describing Moscow’s withdrawal from the moratorium as “the result of NATO countries’ anti-Russian policy.” “This is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with,” he wrote on X. Putin has praised the Oreshnik’s capabilities, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at speeds up to Mach 10 are immune to being intercepted and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.

But Slatkine said the steep tariff level could be aimed to send Switzerland’s Big Pharma — epitomized by Roche and Novartis — a message that it too could come under pressure. The trip comes a day after Switzerland’s executive branch, the Federal Council, held an extraordinary meeting and said it was “keen to pursue talks with the United States on the tariff situation,” the government statement Tuesday said.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s Supreme Court on Monday ordered the house arrest for former President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election — a case that has gripped the South American country as it faces a trade war with the Trump administration. They said his words “good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom” — broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro — cannot “be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.” The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X that the Trump administration “condemns (de) Moraes’ order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.” “Putting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro’s ability to defend himself in public is not a public service. The case against Bolsonaro Brazil’s prosecutors accuse Bolsonaro of heading a criminal organization that plotted to overturn the election, including plans to kill Lula and Justice de Moraes after the far-right leader narrowly lost his reelection bid in 2022. Monday’s order followed one from the top court last month that ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and imposed a curfew on his activities while the proceedings are underway.

De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with “a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary” — likely a veiled reference to Trump’s support for Bolsonaro. On Monday, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs called the Brazilian justice “a U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser” and accused him of using “institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy.” De Moraes said in his decision that “(Brazil’s) judiciary will not allow a defendant to make a fool out of it.” “Justice is the same for all. Possible trouble ahead Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro’s house arrest opens a new moment for the country’s opposition, which will could gather steam in fighting against Lula’s reelection bid next year. “One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,” the analyst said. Lula was imprisoned for 580 days between 2018 and 2019 in a corruption conviction that was later tossed out by the Supreme Court, citing the bias of the judge in the case. Michel Temer, who became president after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016, was arrested for 10 days in 2019 in connection with a graft investigation, which later ended without a conviction.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department on Tuesday for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to President Donald Trump and other former top officials. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation. Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein — and who else could have been involved. Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee nodded to that line of questioning last month by initiating the subpoenas for the Clintons, both Democrats, as well as demanding all communications between President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein.

Article: Tom Lehrer, a social and political satirist who amassed a devoted following in the 1950s and 1960s for routines featuring blithely subversive musical numbers such as “So Long Mom (A Song for World War III),” “National Brotherhood Week” and “The Vatican Rag,” died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lehrer — an Ivy League mathematics teacher who spent his early academic career on the periphery of show business — created a repertoire of songs that subverted saccharine clichés about romance, patriotism and small-town life when they weren’t skewering the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America or the U.S. “All the world seems in tune/ On a spring afternoon/ When we’re poisoning pigeons in the park,” he warbled to the one-two-three of a tinkling waltz titled “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.” Sentimentality was Mr. Get in line in that processional Advertisement Step into that small confessional There, the guy who’s got religion’ll Tell you if your sin’s original His astute social commentary, verbal dexterity and often academic subject matter differentiated him from mere novelty acts. His song “National Brotherhood Week” was a send-up of platitudes about racial conciliation during bloody civil rights encounters and famously envisioned Black singer and civil rights activist Lena Horne and segregationist Alabama sheriff James Clark dancing cheek to cheek. Lehrer was not the only social satirist of the post-World War II period — Stan Freberg and Mort Sahl were contemporaries, and it was the heyday of Mad magazine — but he is the only one still widely known. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Many of his topics, among them the military-industrial complex, the threat of nuclear Armageddon, xenophobia and environmental catastrophe, still resonate with pointed lyrics about moral ambiguity and ethical compromise. His ballad “Wernher von Braun,” focused on the Nazi Germany missile scientist who later worked for NASA: “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?’/‘That’s not my department,’ says Wernher von Braun.” All four of the LPs that Mr. Lehrer made in the 1950s and 1960s are still in print, with one, 1964’s “That Was the Year That Was,” earning a gold record a remarkable 31 years after its release. Demento’s radio show, the first being another avowed Lehrer fan, “Weird Al” Yankovic.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Thomas Andrew Lehrer was born April 9, 1928, in Manhattan, where his father was a necktie manufacturer. He described himself as “Jewish by ancestry — more to do with the delicatessen than the synagogue.” He began studying classical piano at 7 but soon abandoned it in favor of learning the popular songs of the day. His most-cited musical influence was entertainer Danny Kaye, whose delivery in “Tchaikovsky” — a rhyming list of 50 Russian composers recited at breakneck speed — he quickly learned to imitate. As an undergraduate, he wrote the college fight song send-up “Fight Fiercely, Harvard” (“Albeit they possess the might/ Nonetheless we have the will”) that remained a staple of the university’s football games for decades. Three years later, having realized with some surprise that he had accumulated enough material to make a record, he paid $15 for an hour of studio time and recorded the dozen tunes that comprise “Songs by Tom Lehrer” in one sitting. Lehrer told The Washington Post in 1982, “I was often accused of bad taste in the ’50s and ’60s, but the songs which prompted that accusation seem positively genial today.” He was a peculiarly 1950s figure — a well-mannered iconoclast, the antiestablishment figure operating within the establishment. Advertisement In addition to teaching at Harvard, Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — at one point concurrently — he spent 16 years pursuing a PhD that he never completed, and remained a familiar campus figure even during his brief stint in the limelight. Rather than wait to be drafted, he enlisted in the Army (inspiration for his tune “It Makes a Fellow Proud to be a Soldier”) and worked for the National Security Agency from 1955 to 1957. Lehrer was famously ambivalent about performing, and many factors influenced his decision to quit: He eschewed the “anonymous affection” offered by audiences and took a cynical view of his function as an entertainer. In 1964, he was hired to write topical tunes for the short-lived NBC program “That Was the Week That Was.” He did not perform on the show, whose regulars included David Frost, Buck Henry and Alan Alda; his songs were sung on the air by folk singer Nancy Ames. Lehrer complained that the show’s producers took out all the best lines and replaced them with “something vapid,” so the following year he performed them himself on his third and final album, “That Was the Year That Was.” Many of his most trenchant songs hail from this period: “The Folk Song Army,” “Send the Marines” and “National Brotherhood Week.” Mr. Lehrer’s career took an unpredictable turn in 1970, when his Harvard friend Joe Raposo tapped him to write 10 songs for the Children’s Television Workshop show “The Electric Company.” Today the best-known of these is “Silent E” (Who can turn a cub into a cube?/ Who can turn a tub into a tube?). Lehrer — who never married and ascribed the fact to his short attention span — began to divide his time between Cambridge and Santa Cruz, California, where he joined the University of California at Santa Cruz faculty. He spent January through June in California, teaching, among other things, mathematics to liberal arts students, a class he jokingly referred to as “Math for Tenors.” He also taught a popular course in the history of musical theater. The production, a modest success that was later performed in New York, occasioned a burst of “Where Is He Now?” press coverage — a burst that was repeated in 2000, when Rhino Entertainment released a comprehensive three-disc box set of Mr. Writing in the liner notes to the 1997 compilation “Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer,” he said, “If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.” Sophia Nguyen contributed to this report.

Family members for Angela Clay said in statements that they had waited more than three decades for the execution and regretted that Black had not taken responsibility for his crimes. During the briefing, media witnesses reported seeing Black exhibit signs of distress such as sighing heavily, panting and raising and lowering his head around 10:34 a.m., after the intravenous flow began. Advertisement “It was unanimous among all of us that he was in distress, and we heard him in distress,” said Nashville Banner editor Steve Cavendish, one of the media witnesses. Attorneys for Black had petitioned to force the TDOC to deactivate Black’s cardiac implantable electronic device shortly before his lethal injection, arguing that it could prolong his death by delivering painful shocks to his heart to try to revive him. After Nashville General Hospital, identified by the prison as the partner medical provider, said it would refuse to participate, the state Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s ruling, allowing Black’s execution to move forward. Advertisement Paul Litton, who previously taught bioethics and is dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, told The Post last week that cases like Black’s are an ethical quandary for medical providers. Major health care associations like the American Medical Association and the American Society of Anesthesiologists generally oppose their members taking part in executions, but some health care workers might be willing to participate if they can spare a prisoner additional suffering, Litton said. Even without the ethical issues raised by the deactivating the heart implant, Henry said that under current standards, Black would not even be on death row given his intellectual disability.

Investigation of debris from the Titan showed a failure of the adhesive that glued the craft’s carbon fiber hull to titanium segments at the front and back of the sub, according to the report. The CEO of a submersible manufacturing company deemed a prototype of the Titan “amateurish” after inspecting it in 2019, he testified, and an engineering contractor who worked with OceanGate said the company had a culture of “safety theater” and often dismissed concerns from experts. OceanGate’s own director of marine operations frequently raised safety concerns to other company leaders about the Titan sub but was fired by Rush in 2018, the Coast Guard report said. An OSHA investigator assigned to the case said he faced a backlog of complaints at the time, and OSHA never began an investigation into OceanGate, according to the Coast Guard report. Other sub operators and former OceanGate employees also testified that the company tried to skirt federal regulations by designating Titan passengers as “mission specialists.” In reality, the “mission specialists” performed no specialized work and in fact paid to be on the sub.

Article: “I kind of have the attitude of: If somebody else can do it, you know, why can’t I?” Case in point: After failing to finish a 135-mile race within the time limit three years ago, and limping across the finish line from cramps, Becker figured he would never accomplish his goal of becoming the event’s oldest finisher. “And I absolutely fell in love with it.” Becker ran the mile competitively for his high school track team but didn’t get into running as an adult until 2002, when his friends invited him to a marathon in Duluth, Minnesota, thinking it would be a fun get-together. After Becker ran about 100 miles in the Florida Keys in 2007 — taking him roughly 28 hours — he turned the route into an ultramarathon he founded called the KEYS100. When he wasn’t near steep hills, Becker simulated them by dragging an SUV tire from a rope tied around his waist — an idea he said was bizarre when an endurance running trainer, Lisa Smith-Batchen, taught it to him. Advertisement One of Becker’s favorite races came in November 2016, when he ran about 100 miles in southwest China, near the same area his late father, Mickey, fought Japanese soldiers while serving in the U.S. In July 2022, Becker ran the Badwater Ultramarathon, which starts at eastern California’s Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, and ends 135 miles later at Whitney Portal, which leads to Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States. Smith-Batchen and three of Becker’s friends followed him during the July race in a black Cadillac Escalade, giving him energy gels, milk chocolate-flavored Ensure and iced bandannas, and spraying cold water onto his back.

Article: AKRON, Ohio — Alexis Martin, a prominent antitrafficking activist, was ordered released from prison Monday following more than a decade of lobbying from advocates, legislators and celebrities, who argued courts should do more to protect, rather than punish, child trafficking survivors who commit crimes related to their abuse. An Ohio judge’s decision to suspend Martin’s sentence and free her on judicial release was the result of an agreement in which Martin pleaded guilty to lesser charges, including involuntary manslaughter, for her role in the death of her alleged abuser when she was 15. It’s now time for us to have you in the presence of individuals who will help you make good decisions,” said Judge Joy Malek Oldfield of the Summit County Common Pleas Court. Martin had already served more than 11½ years and might not have had the same support services available to her in the future if her time in prison were prolonged, Oldfield said. But rather than have her original sentence thrown out entirely, the state placed Martin under parole supervision for at least 14 years, equal to the minimum remainder of her sentence. “As a former prosecutor handling these cases, it just seemed wrong that she would be punished like she was.” Advertisement Advertisement Martin’s defense had argued that Martin would not be subject to a similar judgment and sentence if she were tried today given the increased understanding prosecutors and police have around the effects of trafficking on victims who commit crimes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “It’s not that I want revenge, but this is my family’s truth: Every birthday, every holiday, every ordinary day there’s something missing,” Dennis, 36, told The Post on the eve of the hearing. In court Monday, Dennis was joined by her brother, Alecio Samuel — who was shot in the head during the 2013 incident that killed his brother — and mother, Marjorie Rumph, who all pleaded with Oldfield not to release Martin, whom they described as manipulative and dangerous. Advertisement Advertisement Clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, Martin spoke in a quiet but steady voice as she accepted responsibility for her role in Kerney’s death and said she was committed to rebuilding her life. “But in the time that I’ve served, I’ve changed the reckless adolescent mindset that I had.” “I want to help society so that no little girl or teen is ever in my position.” Martin’s case was the subject of a 2022 Washington Post investigation that found officials failed to afford the teen the protections of Ohio’s “safe harbor” law, which is meant to direct child sex trafficking victims into supportive services, and in most cases, eventually dismiss the charges against them. Advertisement Such laws have become increasingly common as antitrafficking advocates have pushed officials to recognize that minors forced into commercial sex are frequently arrested for crimes they commit at the direction of — or to escape — their traffickers. The teen told police that Kerney was her “pimp,” and that she had helped orchestrate the robbery, saying, “I set my dad up.” Judges later acknowledged there was evidence Martin was being sold by Kerney. “People have watched this case closely because there was a sense that justice was not done in her case, that she was not treated as a victim of human trafficking,” said Sally Duffy, who sits on the board of the U.S. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now, Martin is planning to complete her transition program in Franklin County, where she will spend at least the next 18 months living, working and receiving counseling and services through Amethyst House, a recovery center for survivors of sex trafficking and drug addiction. Martin will be supervised by CATCH Court, a trauma-informed subdivision of the Franklin County Municipal Court designed to address the needs of defendants who have experienced prostitution and sex trafficking.

Article: Pregnant veterans would no longer be allowed to receive abortions at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnancy threatens their health under a proposed rule from the Trump administration that would revoke a Biden-era policy expanding abortion access. Months after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022, the Biden administration implemented a rule change allowing VA for the first time to provide abortion services for veterans and eligible family members in limited circumstances, including in states with abortion bans. Thus, VA said, the policy change was “essential.” In its filing Friday, the Trump administration called the 2022 rule change “inappropriate” and “legally questionable.” The Trump team’s move to once again restrict abortion access has received praise from conservatives who staunchly oppose federal funding for abortion services of any kind. Advertisement Lindsay Church, executive director of Minority Veterans of America, which pushed against the proposal, worries that if the new abortion rule takes effect, it would push veterans away from receiving health care through VA. I would go anywhere else.” A VA spokesperson called the Biden-era policy “politically motivated.” Trump’s proposed rule, which is open for a 30-day public comment period that started Monday, would bring VA “back in line with historical norms,” the spokesperson said in a statement. Advertisement When the Biden administration expanded abortions through VA, it was among the few strategies officials could leverage to protect access to the procedure after the high court overturned Roe v. The VA rule mirrored the policy of the Defense Department, which can perform or pay for abortions for service members and their beneficiaries only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. The Biden-era VA said in 2022 that it was “unconscionable” that veterans did not have access to “these same critical services following their transition to civilian life.” The policy was geared toward veterans living in states hostile to abortion, especially in the South, the region that most severely restricted abortion access after Roe fell.

Article: The technology behind that — “Drone as First Responder,” or DFR — has skyrocketed in popularity among police departments nationwide since the Federal Aviation Administration streamlined the process for agencies to adopt the program this spring. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “When you have a camera in the sky that can see things that police officers can’t normally see, that offers a huge potential for privacy invasion,” said Beryl Lipton, a senior researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. One of the hardest aspects of policing is that in calls for service, “we don’t have crystal balls, we don’t know what we’re going into,” said Roxana Kennedy, chief of the police department in Chula Vista, California. There is no public list of law enforcement agencies that have adopted the programs, and gray areas around what constitutes a DFR versus a different kind of drone program makes creating a definitive count difficult. Advertisement The FAA has approved waivers for at least 300 agencies to adopt drone first-responder programs so far this year, according to Werner, who said he meets regularly with representatives of the federal regulatory agency. Advertisement Advertisement “The FAA made the review process faster by removing duplicate steps and giving first responders updated guidance on how to submit waiver requests,” an FAA spokesperson said in an unsigned statement to The Washington Post. They don’t need to be within an officer’s line of sight, which is why they require a special waiver from the FAA as part of a regulatory process meant to prevent collisions and other hazards. The incident that “changed everything” for Kennedy, she said, was when a drone responded in 2019 to a call about a man who appeared to be erratically waving a gun. Advertisement “Drones and aerial cameras could be used to surveil political protests, and it could even be deployed for other purposes to see who is seeking health care in California from another state, or used to track who’s coming and going at an immigration courthouse,” said Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. “So the idea that we should all be assured that law enforcement is just saying, ‘Don’t worry, it’s only for a narrow purpose’ flies in the face of what’s happened historically.” Advertisement Advertisement In Chula Vista, a lawsuit filed by a local newspaper publisher seeks to force the police department to release the drone video footage collected in one month of 2021. Privacy advocates say police departments may promise to use the DFRs only to respond to calls for service or certain kinds of emergencies, but once the technology is out of the bottle, it will be hard to put it back in. Advertisement Advertisement Skydio, a DFR manufacturer, works with agencies to help develop policies surrounding drone use, “and more importantly, how they do not intend on using drones,” said Noreen Charlton, the senior manager of public safety marketing at the firm. In Redmond, the city’s policy “prohibits the department from using drones for general surveillance, harassing or discriminating against individuals or groups, or conducting personal business.” But those concerned about excessive surveillance remain skeptical. Part of that, she said, could involve “annual reviews by the city council and public meetings to discuss what reasons the surveillance tools were used for and whether there were any violations.” In the same vein, independent oversight bodies and local government could help assuage some of the concerns by imposing strict limits on the programs, said Jay Stanley, a privacy and technology policy analyst at the ACLU.

In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked. Another lawsuit concerns the termination of the agency’s funding for 56 state and territorial humanities councils, which by law are entitled to a portion of the agency’s funding, which they use to support local projects, including many in rural areas.

Article: The real reason weather forecasters (like me) often appear to get it wrong 5 minutes ago Share Save Carol Kirkwood Lead weather forecaster Share Save BBC Sometimes I'll be walking around a supermarket, and a shopper will approach me in the aisle. Despite great strides in the accuracy of forecasting, there are still gaps in public trust Liz Bentley, a professor of meteorology at Reading University and chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, says that a one-day forecast is correct over 90% of the time. When YouGov asked British adults last summer whether they trusted the weather forecast, a substantial minority - 37% - said they didn't trust it "very much" or "at all." (Reassuringly, 61% said they did trust forecasters like me.) Jokes about the forecast are widespread. The 2012 Olympics opening ceremony included a clip of the moment from 1987, when the weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry because there wouldn't be a hurricane - only for a storm to hit hours later. AFP via Getty Images In the summer months in particular, viewers pay huge attention to the weather forecast Another part of the challenge is how that wealth of information is boiled down and communicated. It's difficult to condense the masses of data into a snappy, digital app-friendly predictions Every day, across the British Isles, forecasters collect "observations" (or data) on things like temperature and wind speed, through a network of more than 200 "weather stations" run by the Met Office. Chaos Theory: when weather goes wrong The atmosphere is known as a "chaotic system", meaning that a slight error - even as small as 0.01C - in the initial observations can produce a drastically different result. A slight error in the data - even as small as 0.01C - in the initial observations can produce a drastically different result In the 1990s, a weather event needed to be larger than about 100 miles (161km) before it could be fully observed - now, the UK-wide weather model used by the Met Office can map weather events as small as 2 miles (3km), Prof Bentley says. "It's as complex as nuclear fusion physics, but most of us don't experience that day to day, and so we don't have to come up with a way to communicate that science to the public." One cause of confusion is when different weather providers appear to show different forecasts - Carol Kirkwood explains why this happens It's also easy to forget that forecasting is just that - predicting. In this style, forecasters could say things like, "What we're seeing now is similar to what we saw at a certain event a few years ago' - something within memory." Getty Images More creativity is needed in communicating the weather, according to some experts - one has suggested a "storyline approach" This is partly why the Met Office, in 2015, decided to name storms. "Because they've had that information given to them so often, they kind of get it." The new weather super predictor Weather forecasting could soon change dramatically with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In 1987, weather forecaster Michael Fish told viewers not to worry because there wouldn't be a hurricane - only for a storm to hit hours later But Prof Bentley identifies a weakness in AI-driven weather models: they are fed with reams of historic data, and trained to spot patterns - which in her view makes it very difficult to predict events that haven't happened yet. But if AI is always looking backwards, it will never see 41 because we've not had it yet." Prof Turner accepts that this is a challenge with AI models like his and says his team is working on remedies. "Do you put something on [a weather app] that says, 'If you're planning a barbecue, then you might want to do it at lunchtime because the chances are you're going to get washed out in the afternoon'?" This chimes with a trend I've noticed from my own career: a growing interest in understanding the science behind the weather. Carol Kirkwood has been a weather forecaster for 30 years and has observed a change in what viewers want Viewers are no longer just interested in knowing whether there'll be a heatwave; they want to know why.

Trump has tried to lessen some of the questions and criticism on the issue by lobbying for the release of grand jury testimony connected to Epstein, who died in prison while waiting to go on trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In a court filing submitted on Tuesday, Maxwell's lawyers pushed back against the government's attempt to make the transcripts public, arguing it could negatively impact her efforts to have the Supreme Court review her case.

A lawyer for the government, Nicole O’Connor, argued at a hearing in July that the funds can be used both for disaster recovery and disaster prevention and that FEMA should have discretion to use the money how it sees fit. READ MORE: Why older rural Americans can be hit hardest after floods and other disasters “There is an inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and the potential hardship accruing to the States from the funds being repurposed is great,” Stearns wrote. “The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives.” The program has provided grants for a range of disaster management projects, including strengthening electrical grids, constructing levees for flood protection and relocating vulnerable water treatment facilities. FEMA said in a news release in April that it was “ending” the program, but the agency’s acting chief, David Richardson, later said in a court filing that FEMA was merely evaluating whether to end or revise it. Stearns said it appeared FEMA had decided to end the program and was “inching towards a fait accompli,” noting it had cancelled new funding opportunities and told stakeholders they shouldn’t expect any unobligated funding.

Article: Zara ads banned for 'unhealthily thin' models 47 minutes ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards • @edwardsclm Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Zara Two adverts by fashion brand Zara have been banned for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said shadows and a slick back bun hairstyle made one model appear "gaunt" while the pose and low cut design of a shirt in another image showed the model's "protruding" collarbones. The watchdog ruled that the "irresponsible" adverts must not appear again in their current form and that Zara must ensure all its images were "prepared responsibly." Zara has removed the adverts and said that both models in question had medical certification proving they were in good health when the pictures were taken. It also said the positioning of her upper arms and elbow joints made her look "out of proportion." 'Protruding collarbones' Zara The other banned advert was for a shirt and the model was said to be in a position that made "protruding" collarbones a "focal feature" of the advert.

Article: Call for help with school uniform costs in England 38 minutes ago Share Save Dan Whitworth & Dearbail Jordan Reporting from Winsford, Cheshire Share Save Getty Images Few councils offer school uniform support, and one of the UK's largest debt advisers has called on the government to change that Low-income families in England struggling with the cost of school uniform should be offered grants as standard, one of the UK's largest debt advisers has said. The Department for Education (DfE) said it was already changing the law to limit the number of branded items schools can insist on, saving some families over £50 on the back-to-school shop. Money Wellness says of 153 local education authorities in England, just 22 offer a dedicated uniform grant, while a further seven provide help but only in exceptional circumstances such as fire, flooding or being made homeless. But, it said: "The vast majority offer nothing at all." Mr Rolfe said: "We urgently need a consistent, national approach to school uniform support to ensure no child is disadvantaged simply because of where they live." The Local Government Association, the membership group for English councils, said: "While some councils choose to help parents with the cost of school uniforms, funding pressures on council budgets make it increasingly difficult for them to continue these concessionary grants. While pupils in England are still out for the summer, the break finishes in around four weeks' time and the Children's Society charity said now is the time that school uniform banks are starting to get busier. "And Dillon will grow out of them so it is a continual issue really and with Christmas not far off, it is back-to-back for families with costs." Jason, with Amelia, Julie and Bobby, says councils should standardise help with school uniform costs With household bills such as energy, water and council tax rising in April, Mr Rolfe said the costs of the start of the school year was an added financial burden. Jason, who was at the Green Uniform and Baby Bank in Cheshire with his wife Julie and their children Amelia and Bobby, said it was not just low income families who were struggling with costs. Josh, whose daughter Isabella was going into year seven, said the cost of school uniforms was "very high", but he received an email from the school telling him about the bank. There used to be a lot of stigma, it had to be branded but now there's no stigma on that, everyone's in the same boat struggling." And it is a sustainable way to shop, according to Jason: "You're not having uniforms and clothes going to landfill sites". The Green Uniform and Baby Bank's Michelle Hawthorne says it has never been busier Michelle Hawthorne, who helps run a school uniform bank in Winsford, Cheshire, said school uniform costs were an "enourmous" pressure for families. unbearable." A Department for Education spokesperson said: "Our Plan for Change is removing barriers to opportunity, with limits on branded items of school uniform just one of the steps we're taking to put money back into parents' pockets and break the link between background and success."

Article: RFK Jr cancels $500m in mRNA vaccine development in the US Doctors and health experts have criticised Kennedy's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of vaccines and his debunked views on health policies. The development of mRNA vaccines to target Covid-19 was critical in helping slow down the pandemic and saving millions of lives, said Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official. Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted the flu virus mutates every year regardless of whether people get vaccinated, while the measles virus has not mutated, despite the majority of people being vaccinated with an mRNA shot. HHS said the department that runs the vaccine projects, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), would focus on "platforms with stronger safety records and transparent clinical and manufacturing data practices". In June, he fired all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations, replacing them with some people who have criticized the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

Article: No bullying found in Harry charity row, but blame for all sides Prince Harry left the Sentebale charity that he had co-founded But the commission did criticise "all parties" for allowing a "damaging" dispute to play out publicly - and gave the charity a regulatory action plan to deal with "governance weaknesses". Harry quits charity he set up in Diana's honour over internal row Although Prince Harry's team welcomed the finding that there had not been evidence of bullying, a spokesman said the report "falls troublingly short" in that the "consequences of the current chair's actions will not be borne by her". "Sentebale's problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity's reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity's ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve," said Charity Commission chief executive David Holdsworth. The row had seen Prince Harry accused of being a "toxic" brand by the charity's chair Ms Chandauka - and he had stepped down saying his and the trustees' relationship with her was broken "beyond repair" and saying that they had faced " blatant lies ". Sophie Chandauka says the charity will continue and grow stronger The current chair, Ms Chandauka, remains at the head of the charity, with the watchdog finding no reason for her not to continue. The Charity Commission also said that although there was no evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir [discrimination against black women], it acknowledged a "strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties" and said it wasn't its role as a regulator to adjudicate on individual claims of bullying. "For 19 years, its dedicated staff and steadfast supporters have provided vital care to over 100,000 young people across southern Africa, including young people living with HIV/Aids and those facing mental health challenges," said a spokesman for Prince Harry. Prince Harry's spokesman said the charity had been grown to become a "flowering force for good" and that he will "now focus on finding new ways to continue supporting the children of Lesotho and Botswana". Ms Chandauka said: "Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso." The Charity Commission concluded that those running charities should not let disagreements make them forget their initial good intentions and to focus on those they were trying to help.

Article: Despite Trump's peace calls, Russian attacks on Ukraine double since inauguration 3 hours ago Share Save Matt Murphy & Ned Davies BBC Verify Share Save Reuters Russia has more than doubled the number of drones and missiles fired towards Ukraine since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, a BBC Verify analysis has found, despite his calls for a ceasefire. However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions. The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared to 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term. "This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long," White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. "President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to NATO members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire." In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again. On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: "What the hell happened to him [Putin]?" Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city. "Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live," Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June. "Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that." Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks. "It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites," he said. Justin Bronk, an analyst focussing on the Russian military at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said restrictions on the supply of military equipment imposed by the White House had made Ukraine "vulnerable" to missile and drone attacks. But he also noted that Russia has ramped up the production of missiles and so-called 'kamikaze' drones such as the Geran-2 - a domestically produced version of the Iranian Shahed drone. EPA Russia is said to be producing huge numbers of Geran drones for use against Ukraine Ukraine's Military Intelligence agency (HUR) recently told domestic media that Russia was now producing up to 85 ballistic missiles per month, up from 44 in April 2024. In a recent interview with Russian military TV, the facility's director Timur Shagivaleyev boasted that Alabuga had become "the largest combat drone production plant in the world", adding that his workers were producing nine times more units than initially expected.

Article: Taiwanese TV show imagines Chinese invasion 4 hours ago Share Save Tessa Wong BBC News, Asia Digital Reporter Share Save Watch: Taiwanese TV show explores Chinese invasion scenario A Chinese fighter jet plane crashes in the waters off Taiwan's coast, prompting Chinese warships to blockade the island for a "search and rescue". Showrunner Chen Hsin-mei told the BBC she wanted to make the series to "warn the Taiwanese people that the war is really coming," citing China's rising use of "disinformation campaigns and grey zone warfare to put our society in chaos and make us confused about our identity". Zeroday Cultural and Creative The show depicts "fifth column" Chinese sympathisers stirring up unrest in Taiwan Zero Day Attack's message echoes the rhetoric of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government and its leader President William Lai, who have warned about China's threat and preached the need to raise the island's defences. In recent days Wang Hung-wei, a prominent lawmaker from the opposition Kuomintang party, criticised Zero Day Attack as "selling dried mangoes", a Taiwanese euphemism that means stoking unnecessary fear about the destruction of one's country. While Lai has in the past described himself as a "pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence", he has also insisted Taiwan has no need to formally declare independence because it is already a sovereign nation. "The Taiwanese people can relate to it as it reflects our current situation, the Chinese Communist Party must be repulsed as their tactics have been exposed." Some have praised the first episode, which depicts the invasion quietly beginning amid a contentious presidential election marked by violence and political fighting. Polls show that most Taiwanese do not believe Beijing will attack imminently, and prefer the "status quo" in Taiwan's relationship with China, which means neither unifying with Beijing nor formally declaring independence.

Article: The decision by Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the “Russia Hoax” comes at a time of increasing pressure on the Trump administration to produce more information about the F.B.I.’s files on Jeffrey Epstein. President Trump has urged and browbeaten supporters to shift their obsession from the Jeffrey Epstein files to the investigation and potential prosecution of Democratic officials he accuses of persecuting him, a cardinal grievance that bonds him to his base. Trump, reeling from the angry backlash over its handling of the Epstein case, is now taking its most concrete — if still murky — investigative steps against Trump targets, starting with officials he blames for what he sees as the plot against him: the investigation of his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia. Attorney General Pam Bondi this week authorized prosecutors to investigate the inquiry the president calls the “Russia hoax” and present a case to a grand jury in South Florida if the evidence warrants it, according to people briefed on the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations. But Trump appointees are reluctant to present evidence to a grand jury in the District of Columbia where key decisions in the Russia investigation were made nearly a decade ago. The decision to authorize a grand jury investigation, which could include subpoenas, into the statements and testimony by government officials surrounding the 2016 election suggests the Trump administration has begun turning its rhetoric of revenge into action. Such concerns, however significant, have been swept aside, at least for now, by the eagerness to appease an impatient president demanding to use the vast powers of federal law enforcement to exact vengeance — and the political imperative of making the Epstein fiasco disappear. Many Trump advisers and allies also view the Russia investigation as a gross abuse of power, while some were personally affected by the inquiry and forced to hire lawyers to defend themselves. Trump has privately carped about the slow pace of Justice Department action to his political enemies, according to people in his orbit, and made it unmistakably known what he wanted. Bondi’s order — then celebrated the move to investigate Obama administration national security officials, saying “they deserve it.” The decision also comes as the Trump administration faces increasing pressure to produce more information about the F.B.I.’s files on Mr. The emergence of the grand jury inquiry was unusual in several ways — not least, because its existence was revealed to right-leaning media outlets like Fox News before any actual investigative steps had apparently been taken. Last week, an obscure agency that scrutinizes potential misconduct by or against federal employees, the Office of Special Counsel, took a step in that direction, confirming it was investigating Jack Smith, the former federal prosecutor who oversaw the criminal cases against Mr. Trump, who is marking his first six months in office, would have pushed quite so forcefully for the department to act against his perceived foes if the Epstein case was not still smoldering political fire. Epstein’s interactions with wealthy and powerful friends — are equally if not more enthusiastic about deploying the Justice Department, F.B.I., and intelligence services to uncover what they claim to be a vast decade-long, Democratic-led conspiracy to destroy Mr. Trump’s key congressional allies and some of the most vocal members of his base have been beating the drums for arrests almost from the moment that the bureau and intelligence officials started releasing documents on the Russia investigation last month. On Monday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, posted a message on social media with a “scorecard” showing that no one had been arrested yet for popular MAGA-world bugbears like the “Russia Collusion Hoax,” “Jan. Among the most fervid Trump supporters calling for arrests are the rioters who were charged in connection with — and then granted clemency for — the storming of the Capitol on Jan. “Dear God, has anyone been arrested yet?” wrote one pardoned rioter, Benjamin Martin, who was initially sentenced to 13 months in prison for holding open a door at the Capitol so that others could spray chemicals at the police. Bondi by referring the investigation of the Russian investigation to the Justice Department, claiming a cache of documents she released proved Obama administration officials engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy.” In response, Ms. The claims by Trump supporters that Obama-era officials engaged in a far-reaching conspiracy to undermine his 2016 campaign have already been exhaustively investigated by a special counsel, John Durham, with little to show for it. Durham filed two criminal indictments based on that investigation, one against a private practice lawyer on charges of lying to the F.B.I., and another against a Russia analyst for essentially the same offense.

Article: Violent Channel smuggling gang's French and UK network exposed by undercover BBC investigation 11 hours ago Share Save Andrew Harding Paris correspondent Share Save BBC The BBC team filmed senior gang member, Abdullah, in northern France - and another man at a busy UK station A BBC investigation has exposed the French and UK operations of a powerful and violent smuggling gang taking people across the English Channel in small boats. A reporter, posing as a migrant wanting to cross, helped us gain unprecedented access to the smugglers' notorious forest hideout in northern France - an area plagued by armed battles between rival gangs. We have managed to identify three men - Jabal, Aram and al-Millah - all Iraqi-Kurds, who are believed to lead the outfit, which is one of the main groups in northern France transporting people to the UK by small boat. Another gang member, Besha, who had escorted migrants in France, took a small boat to the UK himself, we learned, ending up in a migrant hostel in West Yorkshire having claimed asylum. Secret filming: The moment cash is handed over at Birmingham New Street station, for a place on a migrant boat "There's no danger," said smuggler Abdullah last week, as he spoke to our undercover colleague and gestured towards a cluster of tents hidden deep within a forest outside the French port of Dunkirk. We need to move early to avoid the police - it's a cat and mouse game," Abdullah continued, with the reassuring smile of an airline official at a check-in counter. "God willing, the weather will be on our side." The trip across the Channel would be with "a mixture of Somalis, Sudanese, Kurds and so on", he explained, boasting about two successful launches the previous week, with 55 people on each. The gang's forest hideout is deep in the trees, outside the French port of Dunkirk Criss-crossed by narrow sandy paths, the forest is beside a main road, a huge canal and a train line, some 4km (2.5 miles) from the French coast. The investigation is continuing." Delrieu later told us there had been "one arrest [of an Iraqi] linked to Sarah's death", but declined to give any further information, citing operational secrecy. So, they're always one step ahead of us." Migrants were led through a forest by smuggler Abdullah, ahead of attempting a Channel crossing It is a gloomy assessment, backed up by some of our own findings during this investigation, and it shows how difficult it may be for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to deliver on his promise to "smash the gangs". Then the gang changed its name twice more - firstly to al-Millah, the nickname of the shadowy third gang leader, and then to Kaka, which means Brother but is also, we believe, another of his nicknames. Although some people carry cash with them, many others arrange to pay the smugglers through bank transfers or via intermediaries in a range of countries including Turkey, Germany, Belgium and the UK. A few hours later in a text, he sent us a UK mobile phone number and indicated his own name "Abdullah" should be used as a payment reference, along with the single word "Birmingham". A few hours later, having arranged for a separate BBC colleague, who also speaks Arabic, to pose as one of Abu Ahmed's relatives in the UK and to hand over an envelope containing the cash, we staked out a meeting place in the centre of Birmingham's New Street. Our undercover reporter met the gang's associate by Ozzy, the mechanical bull in Birmingham New Street station Bahman appeared relaxed and unsuspecting as the two men briefly chatted in the middle of the busy concourse, as we secretly filmed their encounter. We had deliberately left a sum unpaid to give our colleague a good reason to meet Abdullah in his camp, rather than joining the group later as it headed south along the coast to attempt a crossing. With two undercover security guards watching his back from a distance, Abu Ahmed walked towards the forest, following the directions that Abdullah handed out, one texted detail at a time, until he was told to leave the road and clamber down a steep bank. There, he handed over another €400 (£348) to Abdullah, as agreed, before making his excuses, explaining he was staying with other friends in Calais who were also seeking to cross to England. Secret filming: BBC gets access to forest hideout and follows migrants heading for the coast Two days later, our undercover reporter received confirmation from Abdullah that an attempted crossing would be made early the next morning. As we had often observed before, French police were already positioned outside the bus and train stations in Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne - the main gathering points for migrants moving to the beaches. Roughly half of all the small boats crossing the Channel are now so-called "taxi-boats" - a police source told us - launched with few or no passengers and in secret. "Forty-three tickets," said one of the small hands, addressing a bus driver, as he and a crowd of mostly African men and women clustered at the door, alongside our undercover colleague. It was a familiar scene, with different smuggling gangs all arranging for their customers to gather and to travel along the French coastline on public transport towards different launch spots. Our colleague, Abu Ahmed, initially travelled with the migrants, but - for his own safety - we had agreed he would slip away from the group before nightfall, and before they got close to the beaches. They waited for several hours, until early evening, before getting on a local bus heading south towards Ecault beach, an area we knew was a favourite launch spot for the gang. By seven that evening, with our cameras in plain sight, we were openly following Abdullah and perhaps 40 other people, as they walked down a sandy path through the woods and towards the long straight expanse of Ecault beach. Perhaps Abdullah thought that by telling journalists this story, he was building a useful public alias that he might use later - like others in the gang have done - if he ever sought to claim asylum in the UK. The police had found whatever boat the gang had prepared for them overnight - we had seen Abdullah disappear into the darkness for at least an hour at one point - and destroyed it. Quietly, people stood up, gathered their lifejackets and blankets and, following Abdullah and his team, began to walk back up the path towards the closest bus stop to head back to their camps and wait for another chance to cross.

Abu Ahmed said his two friends in Calais also wanted to cross, and that he had left Abdullah's group on the bus because he preferred to travel with his friends.

Article: Titan implosion that killed all five on board was 'preventable', says report 10 hours ago Share Save Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News Share Save American Photo Archive The US Coast Guard has determined the implosion of OceanGate's Titan submersible that killed all five people on board was "preventable", citing the company's "critically flawed" safety practices. A damning 335-page report from Coast Guard investigators states that OceanGate, the company that owned and operated the Titan, failed to follow maintenance and inspection protocols for the deep-sea vessel. "There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework," Jason Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard Marine Board, said in a statement. "This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable," said Jason Neubauer, the chairman of the Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation that was charged with investigating the Titan disaster. "When you listen to the sounds of that hull under stress, and the cracking and the popping, that's the sign of damage in the hull, that means the hull is getting weaker," Mr McCallum said. "So you can't expect to take a vehicle to the same depth every time knowing that it's weaker than the dive before, and expect it not to fail at some stage, It is a mathematical certainty that it will fail," he said. "The tragedy is, you don't know when it's going to fail." Stockton Rush's wife Wendy asks "what's that bang?" in footage that appears in new BBC documentary OceanGate used 'intimidation tactics' to avoid scrutiny The report accuses OceanGate of intentionally avoiding regulatory scrutiny through intimidation and strategic manipulation. OceanGate founder and Titan pilot Stockton Rush's 'negligence' contributed to deaths The report also blames Stockton Rush, OceanGate's founder and the pilot of the Titan sub during its fatal voyage, for contributing to the disaster. "One of the biggest standouts that I think that any company could take away is, if your CEO, was also filling the role of safety officer, and lead engineer at the end, it's just too many," he said. "It's a consolidation of power that leads to no checks and balances." Recommendations to prevent future incidents To prevent similar disasters in future, the Marine Board issued 14 safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard and the wider submersible industry. Key among them: US Coast Guard (USCG) pursue "proper regulatory oversight" of submersibles Revoking ORV (Oceanographic Research Vessel) designations for submersibles, requiring them to meet certification standards under new passenger vessel requirements Dedicated USCG resources "providing field support for vessels of novel design"

Article: When a police force in England and Wales arrests or charges a suspect and they are thinking of giving information to the media, they need to have two things in mind: the laws about contempt of court which are designed to make sure suspects have a fair trial, and the College of Policing guidance on media relations. This culminated in the College of Policing guidance on media relations which says that if someone is arrested (but not yet charged) police should only give the suspect's gender and age. "The person's occupation can be released if it is relevant to the crime - for example, a teacher charged with the assault of a pupil at the school where they work." So there is nothing in the guidance that prevents police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even ethnicity of someone who has been charged. This guidance does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status." While this last sentence is true, the guidance does not actually make suggestions one way or another on ethnicity and immigration status. We do think more information should be provided, including on issues around nationality including on some of those asylum issues." The prime minister's official spokesman had earlier said: "Our position is that authorities, whether it is the police or whether central government, should be as transparent as possible on these issues." In truth, what information should be released to the media is largely at the discretion of the police force. As events in Liverpool in May showed, when forces think it is in the public interest they will release information about a suspect's ethnicity even before they have been charged. When a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's winning of the Premiership title, Merseyside Police quickly said the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a terrorist attack. The College of Policing said: "Police forces make challenging and complex decisions on a case-by-case basis and transparency is essential to prevent misinformation and reassure the public." It said that its guidance was "already under review" and that police forces were considering how to balance their legal obligations with "their responsibility to prevent disorder". The issue of what information police can release about a suspect came sharply into focus last summer when Axel Rudakubana was arrested for murdering three young girls, Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, in Southport.

Article: Clintons subpoenaed to testify in congressional Epstein investigation 52 minutes ago Share Save Ben Hatton and Kayla Epstein BBC News Share Save Getty Images Bill and Hillary Clinton appear onstage together at an event. Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, had indicated she was willing to testify before the powerful investigatory committee, with strict legal protections. The Epstein legal saga has spanned two decades, with Florida police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation first scrutinising the well-connected tycoon for allegations of sexual abuse in the early 2000s. Comer wrote in letters to each person that the committee must "conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr Epstein" and Maxwell. Former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales were summoned, along with Jeff Sessions and William Barr, who both led the justice department during Trump's first term. In 2019, a spokesman said the former president "knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York." The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Article: Trump administration wants more companies using UAVs toggle caption Jeff Roberson/AP The Trump administration wants to make it easier for companies to use drones for business — from delivering coffee to inspecting power lines to working on farms. "And because of that complication, I don't think we saw the innovation that we should have in America." The proposal comes about two months after President Trump signed an executive order on drones, in part to speed up the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by businesses in the United States. Sponsor Message "Drone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crude aircraft, placing an artificial ceiling on innovation and hampering progress," said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance. In an emailed statement to NPR, the Air Line Pilots Association said it was committed to working with the Department of Transportation to "ensure that emerging technologies and drone operations do not compromise aviation safety." The group added that "[r]ecent tragic events have underscored the critical importance of maintaining rigorous safety standards in our increasingly complex airspace, and we will continue advocating for policies that require all airspace users to operate with adequate surveillance, communication, and collision avoidance capabilities." Under the proposed rule, drones used by businesses would have to be built to certain industry standards and have collision avoidance technology to ensure they maintain a safe separation from other aircraft, including commercial airplanes. Commercial drones would be banned from flying over large outdoor gatherings, such as concerts and sporting events, and certain employees would be subject to a security check by the Transportation Security Administration. Asked whether the skies are already too crowded, in light of the accident between a firefighting plane and a drone in Los Angeles this year, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said it was an example of why the proposal was necessary. "So regulating to a common standard, making sure the vehicles comply with our regulations and then surveilling that is a much better place than where we're at today." The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 60 days.

Article: 7, I reported on a proposal from former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called a “squeeze approach,” which he saw as essential to “not play along with the lines that Hamas wrote for us.” Bennett’s central insight was that Israel should avoid being lured into nonstop urban combat and instead surround and isolate the battlefield, allowing food and medicine to get in but not the things Hamas would need to maintain its war machine, particularly fuel for generators in the tunnels. But Gaza would not be where it is now had it not been for Hamas, and Gaza cannot be more than it is now so long as Hamas retains effective control. At the same time, being pro-Israel means looking at Gaza through the wider lens of Israel’s overall interests: the return of the hostages to heal Israel’s heart; the relief of Gaza to rehabilitate Israel’s reputation (above all among wavering friends); the resumption of regional diplomacy to take advantage of Israel’s temporary victories over Hezbollah and Iran; and the restoration of deterrence against Israel’s larger and still-menacing enemies.

Article: Ghislaine Maxwell told DOJ Trump never did anything concerning around her: Sources Ghislaine Maxwell attends day 1 of the 4th Annual WIE Symposium at Center 548 on September 20, 2013 in New York City. During her nine hours speaking with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month, Ghislaine Maxwell said nothing during the interview that would be harmful to President Donald Trump, telling Blanche that Trump had never done anything in her presence that would have caused concern, according to sources familiar with what Maxwell said. Maxwell, an associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was convicted of sex trafficking and other charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022, which she was serving at a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, until her recent move to a more relaxed federal prison camp in Texas. ABC News Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus, said following her meetings with Blanche that Maxwell “would welcome any relief.” He also said Maxwell was asked about "one hundred different people," and said "she didn't hold anything back." Trump, asked Tuesday whether he approved the prison transfer for Maxwell, said, "I didn't know about it at all, no. It's not a very uncommon thing," Trump also just said that anything Blanche discussed with Maxwell during his meetings with her would be "totally above board." Following his first day of meetings with Maxwell, Blanche tweeted that "The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time." CNN first reported the administration was considering releasing the transcripts. In an interview with Newsmax last week, when asked when Americans could hear about the contents of the meeting, Trump said: "I don't know, because I haven't spoken about it, but he's a very talented guy, Todd Blanche, and a very straight shooter, and I think he probably wanted to know, you know, just to get a feeling of it, because we'd like to release everything, but we don't want people to get hurt that shouldn't be hurt.

Article: Global chemical manufacturer DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, have agreed to a $2 billion settlement with New Jersey to resolve environmental claims tied to decades of pollution involving Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), commonly known as “forever chemicals,” as well as other pollutants originating from four industrial sites across the state. It also mandates that DuPont and its affiliates create a $1.2 billion remediation fund for cleanup efforts at the four industrial sites and establish a separate $475 million reserve fund to ensure that, if any of the companies go bankrupt or otherwise fail to meet their obligations, New Jersey taxpayers are not left footing the bill. "Polluters who place profit above public well-being by releasing poisonous PFAS and other contamination in our State can expect to be held responsible to clean up their mess and fully compensate the State and its citizens for the precious natural resources they’ve damaged or destroyed," Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said. In a press release, DuPont, Chemours and Corteva said the settlement will not only resolve the 2019 lawsuit, but “all legacy contamination claims related to the companies’ current and former operating sites (Chambers Works, Parlin, Pompton Lakes and Repauno) and claims of statewide PFAS contamination unrelated to those sites." ABC News reached out to the companies for comment, and they declined to comment further. Commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” PFAS do not break down easily in the human body or the environment, and are associated with certain cancers, hormonal dysfunction, and other health problems, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The affected sites include Pompton Lakes Works in Pompton Lakes and Wanaque in Passaic County; the Parlin Site in Sayreville, Middlesex County; the Repauno Site in Greenwich Township in Gloucester County; Chambers Works, in Pennsville and Carney’s Point in Salem County. “DuPont has finally been held responsible for what they have done to New Jersey, to our public health, and to our environment”, NJ Sierra Club Chapter Director, Anjuli Ramos-Busot, said in a statement. I remain committed to working alongside the Attorney General and the DEP to ascertain how to swiftly and effectively allocate these funds to best clean up our communities and protect public health in the future,” State Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex/Mercer) said.

Mary Rothwell Davis, an attorney for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where Go’s mother works as a priest, said the family had not received an explanation for the arrest or abrupt reversal. “We were moving heaven and earth to make it known that we thought this was a mistake.” A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Go had been placed in expedited removal proceedings for overstaying an expired visa. “The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported," agency spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. A graduate of Scarsdale High School in the suburbs of New York City, Go studies at Purdue's College of Pharmacy and remains active in the Episcopalian church, according to Davis.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

Article: The Justice Department has identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions Associated Press -- The Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.” “Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” she said. The new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York and California, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois. The administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a “non-sanctuary city.” The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a “Page Not Found” error message. The administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York.

Article: A federal judge has temporarily blocked some of Arkansas' largest school districts from enforcing a new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A new Arkansas law requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments cannot be enforced in a handful of the state’s largest school districts where parents brought challenges on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, a federal judge ruled Monday. “Most likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.” The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation. "We’re proud to stand with our clients — families of many different backgrounds — who simply want their kids to get an education.” Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office defended the law, said he was reviewing the decision and assessing legal options. ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Bailey said through a spokesperson that “it is clear from this order and long established law that all should refrain from posting” the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. Last month in Louisiana — the first state that mandated the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms — a panel of three appellate judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional.

Bill Lee declined Monday to grant a reprieve, clearing the way for Byron Black’s execution after a legal battle and ongoing uncertainty about whether the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator will shock his heart when the lethal drug takes effect. Twenty-seven men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. Kelley Henry, Black's attorney, said the execution could become a “grotesque spectacle.” The legal case also spurred a reminder that most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of health care ethics. Linette Bell, whose sister and two nieces were killed, recently told WKRN-TV: “He didn’t have mercy on them, so why should we have mercy on him?” In recent years, Black's legal team has unsuccessfully tried to get a new hearing over whether he is intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty under U.S. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." In Funk's attempt, he focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

In a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the department said it would start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa. A preview of the bond notice, which was posted on the Federal Register website on Monday, said the pilot program would take effect within 15 days of its formal publication and is necessary to ensure that the U.S.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) WENDOVER, Utah -- A driver trying to set a speed record during a racing event at Utah’s famed Bonneville Salt Flats died Sunday after losing control of his vehicle, organizers said. Driver Chris Raschke was treated by medical professionals at the scene, but died from his injuries, according to the Southern California Timing Association, which organizes the popular land-speed racing event known as “Speed Week.” Raschke lost control of the vehicle about two and a half miles into a run. For decades, people have used the flat, glasslike surface at Bonneville Salt Flats, 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Salt Lake City, to set speed records sometimes topping 400 mph (644 kph). According to the Speed Demon racing team’s site, Raschke worked at the Ventura Raceway in the early 1980s, raced 3-wheelers and cars in the mini stock division, learned to fabricate and maintain race cars when working with an acclaimed engine builder and later became a driver for the Speed Demon team.

Article: The Senate is leaving Washington Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of President Donald Trump’s nominees Senate heads home with no deal to speed confirmations as irate Trump tells Schumer to 'go to hell' WASHINGTON -- The Senate left Washington Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of President Donald Trump's nominees, calling it quits after days of contentious bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer can “GO TO HELL!” Without a deal in hand, Republicans say they may try to change Senate rules when they return in September to speed up the pace of confirmations. Trump has been pressuring senators to move quickly as Democrats blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any fast unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that can take several days per nominee. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.” Schumer said a rules change would be a “huge mistake," especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward. The latest standoff comes as Democrats and Republicans have gradually escalated their obstruction of the other party's executive branch and judicial nominees over the last two decades, and as Senate leaders have incrementally changed Senate rules to speed up confirmations — and make them less bipartisan. But Republicans hoped to make a deal with Democrats instead, and came close several times over the last few days as the two parties and the White House negotiated over moving a large tranche of nominees in exchange for reversing some of the Trump administration's spending cuts on foreign aid, among other issues. The Senate held a rare weekend session on Saturday as Republicans held votes on nominee after nominee and as the two parties tried to work out the final details of a deal. “Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.” Thune said afterward that there were “several different times” when the two sides thought they had a deal, but in the end “we didn't close it out.” It’s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn’t allowed at least some quick confirmations. But Democrats had little desire to give in without the spending cut reversals or some other incentive, even though they too were eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.

Pirro, a 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin, who had never served as a prosecutor or tried a case before taking office in January. In the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro’s ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.

Article: Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections Texas state Rep Chris Turner holds a map as he asks questions during a public hearing on congressional redistricting in Austin, Texas, Friday, Aug. The revolt by Democrats, and Abbott giving them until Monday to come home or face efforts to strip them of their elected positions, pushed a widening fight over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections into new territory. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.” A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Pritzker, who has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics during his second term, had been in quiet talks with Texas Democrats for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state to break quorum. Pritzker also met privately with Texas Democratic Chair Kendall Scudder in June to begin planning for the possibility that lawmakers would depart for Illinois if they did decide to break quorum to block the map, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Trump is looking to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency, and hopes the new Texas map will aid that effort.

The son said in his victim impact statement that, “I am not OK and I never will be.” Brooks had been serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault since 2017 and was transferred to Marcy from a nearby lockup on the night he was beaten. Under questioning in May from Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, Walrath admitted that he and other guards assaulted Brooks, that he put Brooks in a chokehold, and that he struck the inmate’s body and groin.

Article: A federal judge has ruled that Rhode Island's gun permit system does not violate the Second Amendment Judge rules that Rhode Island's gun permit system does not violate Second Amendment PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A federal judge says Rhode Island's gun permit system, which requires residents to show “a need” to openly carry a firearm throughout the state, does not violate the Second Amendment. However, it also allows the attorney general’s office to issue open-carry permits “upon a proper showing of need.” Unlike municipalities, the attorney general is not required to issue such permits. The plaintiffs, largely led by Michael O’Neil, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition and a firearm instructor, said in their initial complaint that the attorney general's office denied all seven of their applications in 2021 for an “unrestricted” firearm permit, allowing both open and concealed carry. Smith said in his ruling that unrestricted permits “are a privilege and there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining one.” The plaintiffs had hoped for a similar ruling handed down by the U.S. Yet, notably, Smith said in his ruling that the high court's 2022 ruling did not declare that the Second Amendment “requires open carry,” but even if it did, Rhode Island's law “is within the Nation’s historical tradition of regulation.” Frank Saccoccio, the attorney representing the gun owners, said in an email Monday that they did not believe Smith's decision was in line with the 2022 SCOTUS decision and would be appealing.

(AP Photo/Paul Beaty) William McNeil Jr., left, along with his mother Latoya Solomon, center, and attorney Sue-Ann Robinson, right, look on during a press conference Tuesday, July 29, 2025, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Paul Beaty) A video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles. It offered a unique view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can't clearly be seen in officer body camera footage released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Since McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, “we got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,” said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil. Because what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don’t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.” McNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on due to bad weather, his lawyers said. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: “Physical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.” But after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the sheriff's office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.” The traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated but “it was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful." McNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent — Philando Castile's girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. Christopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil's legal team's suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver's car could offer a unique point of view. It's actually a smart thing in my opinion.” Rod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it's a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police — as long as doing so doesn't make the situation worse. Crump, though, said McNeil's video shows that he “never reaches for anything,” and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window. A camera inside a motorist's vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police bodycams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian's recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. Waters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a football game last year between the universities of Georgia and Florida.

(AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan) MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- Chanting anti-India slogans, hundreds of people rallied Tuesday in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to mark the sixth anniversary of India’s revocation of the disputed region’s semi-autonomous status. The rallies came nearly three months after Pakistan and India exchanged military strikes over a mass shooting in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, a charge Pakistan denied. The protesters denounced the August 5, 2019, revocation of Kashmir's special status by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded the restoration of statehood for the Himalayan region, which has been split between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety. Mazhar Saeed Shah, a leader of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference — an alliance of pro-freedom Kashmiri political and religious groups — at the rally urged the international community to help ensure Kashmiris are granted the right to self-determination, as called for in U.N. Similar anti-India demonstrations were held in Islamabad, where Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s moral and diplomatic support for Kashmiris seeking what he called “freedom from India’s illegal occupation.” Meanwhile in Srinagar in Indian-controlled Kashmir, supporters of India’s opposition Congress party rallied to demand that the government restore the statehood of the disputed region.

(Hu Zhixuan/Xinhua via AP, File) MANILA, Philippines -- A top Philippine security official on Tuesday condemned China’s latest rocket launch, which caused suspected debris to fall near a western Philippine province. “We condemn in no uncertain terms the irresponsible testing done by the People's Republic of China of its Long March 12 rocket which alarmed the public and placed the people of Palawan at risk,” Año said in a statement. People were alarmed after hearing loud explosions Monday night in Palawan’s Puerto Princesa city and nearby towns, Año said, adding that “local residents also saw a fireball cross the sky that later exploded causing the ground to shake.” Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Año's statement. China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that the Long March-12 rocket that lifted off Monday night from a commercial spacecraft launch site on the southern island province of Hainan successfully carried a group of internet satellites into pre-set orbit. The Philippine Space Agency said Monday that debris from the rocket launch was expected to have fallen within two identified drop zones about 21 nautical miles (39 kilometers) from Puerto Princesa City in Palawan and 18 nautical miles (33 kilometers) from Tubbataha Reef Natural Park, an area of coral reefs in the Sulu Sea off eastern Palawan that is popular among divers and conservators. “While not projected to fall on land features or inhabited areas, falling debris poses danger and potential risk to ships, aircraft, fishing boats and other vessels that will pass through the drop zone.” Philippine aircraft and vessels were deployed Tuesday to search for the rocket debris, Año said.

Article: Going online in Russia can be frustrating, complicated and even dangerous How Russia blocks websites and isolates its internet from the world A woman wearing a niqab, checks her phone while walking along the Red Square in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Human Rights Watch researcher Anastasiia Kruope describes Moscow’s approach to reining in the internet as “death by a thousand cuts." "Bit by bit, you’re trying to come to a point where everything is controlled.” Kremlin efforts to control what Russians do, read or say online dates to 2011-12, when the internet was used to challenge authority. Companies like Google or Facebook were pressured to store user data on Russian servers, to no avail, and plans were announced for a “sovereign internet” that could be cut off from the rest of the world. Still, experts had dismissed Kremlin efforts to rein in the internet as futile, arguing Russia was far from building something akin to China’s “Great Firewall,” which Beijing uses to block foreign websites. Last year, authorities raised the cost of obtaining an internet provider license from 7,500 rubles (about $90) to 1 million rubles (over $12,300), and state data shows that more than half of all IP addresses in Russia are managed by seven large companies, with Rostelecom, Russia’s state telephone and internet giant, accounting for 25%. Stanislav Seleznev, cyber security expert and lawyer with the Net Freedom rights group, doesn’t expect ubiquitous prosecutions, since tracking individual online searches in a country of 146 million remains a tall order. Anastasiya Zhyrmont of the Access Now digital rights group said both Telegram and WhatsApp were disrupted in Russia in July in what could be a test of how potential blockages would affect internet infrastructure. It's been helped by “years of perfecting the technology, years of taking over and understanding the architecture of the internet and the players,” as well as Western sanctions and companies leaving the Russian market since 2022, said Kruope of Human Rights Watch.

Article: Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of sending Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against the military in the country’s civil war Sudan accuses the UAE of funding Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the RSF in civil war CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) — Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of sending Colombian mercenaries to fight alongside the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against the military in the country’s civil war. The foreign ministry said in a statement Monday that the Sudanese government has “irrefutable evidence” confirming mercenaries from Colombia and some neighboring African countries were sponsored and financed by Emirati authorities. “This unprecedented phenomenon poses a serious threat to peace and security in the region and across the continent,” the foreign ministry said, asserting that hundreds of thousands of mercenaries were hired from across the African continent. A spokesperson for the Emirati government said at the time that the UAE was the “target of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at undermining our foreign policy, regional role and humanitarian efforts.” Sudan's army and the RSF both have been accused of committing atrocities like ethnic cleansing, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence against civilians, including children.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

(AP Photo/Sujan Gurung, File) FILE - Damaged vehicles are visible after severe monsoon rains flooded the Bhotekoshi River and swept away a key bridge connecting the country with China in Rasuwagadi, north of the capital, Kathmandu, Nepal, July, 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Sujan Gurung, File) KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Floods that damaged hydropower dams in Nepal and destroyed the main bridge connecting the country to China show the vulnerability of infrastructure and need for smart rebuilding in a region bearing the brunt of a warming planet, experts say. The flooding of the Bhotekoshi River on July 8 also killed nine people and damaged an inland container depot that was being built to support increasing trade between the two countries. Elsewhere in the Himalayas, flash floods swept away roads, homes and hotels on Tuesday in northern India, killing at least four people and leaving many others trapped under debris, officials said. The Himalayan region, which crosses Nepal and several nearby countries including India, is especially vulnerable to heavy rains, floods and landslides because the area is warming up faster than the rest of the world due to human-caused climate change. “The risk that goes into building a bridge or other infrastructure is generally based on historical observations of past risk, but this is no longer useful because future risk is different and often much higher.” While damage estimates from the July floods in the Rasuwa region are still being calculated, past construction costs give a sense of the financial toll. This has severely affected workers, hotel operators, laborers, and truck drivers who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods,” said Kaami Tsering, a local government official, in a phone interview with The Associated Press. He added: “The whole area was severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and just when life was slowly returning to normal, this devastating flood struck." The Nepal floods are the latest in a series of disasters in South Asia during this year’s monsoon season. “What we have to avoid is the insanity of rebuilding after a natural disaster in the same place where it occurred and where we know it will occur again at even higher probability," said Pomeroy, the Canadian hydrologist. Unfortunately, that’s what most countries do.” Before rebuilding in Rasuwa, Nepal government officials need to assess overall risks, including those due to extreme weather and climate change, said Bipin Dulal, an analyst at Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The bridge connecting the two countries was rebuilt to better withstand earthquakes after it was destroyed in 2015, but it appears that officials didn't properly account for the risk of flooding as intense as what occurred in early July, Dulal said. In 2024 alone, there were 167 disasters in Asia — including storms, floods, heat waves and earthquakes — which was the most of any continent, according to the Emergency Events Database maintained by the University of Louvain, Belgium. A CDRI analysis found that $124 billion worth of Nepal's infrastructure is vulnerable to the impacts of climate-driven disasters, creating the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses if the country doesn't invest in resiliency.

Chaudary) LAHORE, Pakistan -- Police arrested more than 200 supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday as they tried to hold rallies in cities throughout Pakistan to mark the second anniversary of Khan’s arrest, a party spokesman and officials said. Zulfiqar Bukhari, a spokesman for Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, said police used batons and fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Lahore and the southern provincial capital of Karachi. But the government responded by imposing a ban on gatherings in the capital, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi, where Khan is imprisoned following convictions in multiple cases against him that supporters say were politically motivated. The crackdown on PTI supporters came hours after Pakistan’s election oversight body disqualified opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan and several other PTI lawmakers following their convictions over their alleged role in riots that broke out in May 2023 after Khan’s initial arrest in a corruption case.

Russia says it no longer will abide by its self-imposed moratorium on intermediate-range missiles MOSCOW -- Russia has declared that it no longer considers itself bound by a self-imposed moratorium on the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race as tensions between Moscow and Washington rise again over Ukraine. and its allies create “destabilizing missile potentials" near Russia, creating a "direct threat to the security of our country” and carry “significant harmful consequences for regional and global stability, including a dangerous escalation of tensions between nuclear powers.” It didn't say what specific moves the Kremlin might take, but President Vladimir Putin has previously announced that Moscow was planning to deploy its new Oreshnik missiles on the territory of its neighbor and ally Belarus later this year. “Therefore Russia believes it has the right to take respective steps if necessary.” “Decisions on specific parameters of response measures will be made by the leadership of the Russian Federation based on an interdepartmental analysis of the scale of deployment of American and other Western land-based intermediate-range missiles, as well as the development of the overall situation in the area of international security and strategic stability,” the Foreign Ministry said. Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council chaired by Putin, has apparently sought to curry favor with his mentor by making provocative statements and frequently lobbing nuclear threats. he responded to Trump's deadline for Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine or face sanctions by warning him against “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and declaring that “each new ultimatum is a threat and a step toward war.” Medvedev also commented on the Foreign Ministry’s statement, describing Moscow's withdrawal from the moratorium as “the result of NATO countries’ anti-Russian policy.” “This is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with,” he wrote on X. Putin has praised the Oreshnik’s capabilities, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at speeds up to Mach 10 are immune to being intercepted and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.

(AP Photo/Hadi Mizban) ANKARA, Turkey -- A newly formed parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing a peace initiative with a Kurdish militant group held its inaugural meeting on Tuesday, marking a further significant step toward ending a decades-long insurgency. The 51-member committee, comprised of legislators from most major parties, has been charged with proposing and supervising legal and political reforms aimed at advancing the peace process, following the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK’s, decision to disband and lay down arms. In his opening remarks, Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmus called the committee’s launch a “historic turning point.” “The commission gathered here is no ordinary delegation; it is a historic one, demonstrating the courage to repair our future and the will to strengthen social integration,” he said. The move came after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999, urged his group in February to convene a congress and formally disband and disarm.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

Trump “considers it a great honor to oversee this global sporting spectacle,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, calling sports one of the president's “greatest passions.” LA28 president and chair Casey Wasserman said the task force "marks an important step forward in our planning efforts and reflects our shared commitment to delivering not just the biggest, but the greatest Games the world has ever seen in the summer of 2028.” During a briefing Tuesday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the task force would “coordinate across federal, state and local agencies to ensure streamlined visa processes, robust security and efficient transportation.” Along with the 2028 Summer Games, Trump has said that the 2026 FIFA World Cup being hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico is among the events he's most looking forward to in his second term. In preparation for next year's competition, the governments of all three countries on Tuesday said they had held the first meeting of a trilateral coordinating council of government officials, industry leaders and security professionals discussing a variety of issues including preparedness for any security threats ahead of the World Cup.

In a 2023 case from Alabama, the high court said the congressional districts drawn by the state's Republican-led Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting strength of Black residents.

Republicans are more complimentary of their party, although a small but significant share describe the GOP as “greedy” or say it is generally "bad." The poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July reveals warning signs for both major U.S. adults held a dim view of both parties, with about 4 in 10 using negative attributes, including words such as “dishonest” or “stupid." But nearly nine months after Republican Donald Trump won a second presidential term, Democrats appear to be harboring more resentment about the state of their party than do Republicans. About 15% described it using words like “weak," or “apathetic,” while an additional 10% believe it is broadly “ineffective” or "disorganized.” Only about 2 in 10 Democrats described their party positively, with roughly 1 in 10 saying it is “empathetic,” or “inclusive.” An additional 1 in 10 used more general positive descriptors. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to describe their party positively, with many also using straightforward ideological descriptors like “conservative.” About 4 in 10 Republicans used positive attributes to characterize the GOP, making general mentions of words such as “patriotic” or “hardworking,” or offering associations with the word “freedom.” Samuel Washington, 65, of Chicago, said he typically votes Republican. About 2 in 10 Republicans said something negative about the party, including phrases such as “greedy,” “for the rich” or “corrupt.” Republican Dick Grayson, an 83-year-old veteran from Trade, Tennessee, said he is “disappointed” by his party's fealty to Trump. Among other things, he pointed to the price tag of Trump's tax-and-spend package, which will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. He said he is ready for a serious third party to emerge before the next presidential election, pointing to Elon Musk's new “America Party,” which has been slow to launch.

While bashing Kentucky's longest-serving senator at a GOP dinner on the eve of Saturday's Fancy Farm picnic, a tradition-laden stop on the state's political circuit, Morris was cut off in midsentence by a party activist in the crowd, who noted that McConnell isn't seeking reelection and pointedly asked Morris: “What are you running on?” Morris touted his hard line stance on immigration and defended Trump's tariffs as a boon for American manufacturing. “Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell told a Republican crowd that included Morris at a pre-picnic breakfast in Mayfield. McConnell endorsed Trump in 2024, but in a biography by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, released shortly before the election, McConnell described him as “a despicable human being.” Morris, who started a waste management technology company, says the senator has been insufficiently loyal to Trump and allowed festering issues like immigration and the national debt to grow worse during his years in Senate leadership. "It seems, to me, maybe just maybe, Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago." McConnell had his customary front-row seat for much of the event but wasn't there for Morris' remarks.

Article: The Justice Department is ramping up an effort to get election data from the states The Justice Department seeks voter and election information from at least 19 states, AP finds FILE - Voters wait to receive their ballots at a polling place at McDonald Elementary School, Nov. Over the past three months, the department’s voting section has requested copies of voter registration lists from state election administrators in at least 15 states, according to an Associated Press tally. Today, it is taking steps to crack down on voter fraud and noncitizen voting, both of which are rare but have been the subject of years of false claims from Trump and his allies. The Justice Department does not typically “engage in fishing expeditions” to find laws that may potentially have been broken and has traditionally been independent from the president, said David Becker, a former department lawyer who leads the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research. Election offices in Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Utah, and Wisconsin confirmed to the AP that they received letters from the voting section requesting their statewide voter registration lists. The Justice Department already has filed suit against the state election board in North Carolina alleging it failed to comply with a part of the federal Help America Vote Act that relates to voter registration records. Officials in Arizona, Connecticut, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Wisconsin confirmed to the AP that they received an email from two department lawyers requesting a call about a potential “information-sharing agreement.” The goal, according to several copies of the emails reviewed by the AP, was for states to provide the government with information about instances of election fraud to help the Justice Department “enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections.” One of those sending the emails was a senior counsel in the criminal division. The emails referred to Trump's March executive order on elections, part of which directs the attorney general to enter information-sharing agreements with state election officials to the “maximum extent possible." Election officials in several states that received requests for their voter registration information have not responded. In a July 25 letter to the Justice Department's voting section, Simon’s general counsel, Justin Erickson, said the list “contains sensitive personal identifying information on several million individuals.” He said the office had obligations under federal and state law to not disclose any information from the statewide list unless expressly required by law. In a recent letter, Republican lawmakers in the state called on Simon to comply with the federal request as a way "to protect the voting rights of the citizens of Minnesota.” Maine's secretary of state, Democrat Shenna Bellows, said the administration's request overstepped the federal government’s bounds and that the state will not fulfill it. There is nothing inherently wrong with the Justice Department requesting information on state procedures or the states providing it, said Justin Levitt, a former deputy assistant attorney general who teaches at Loyola Law School.

Article: Nancy Mace of South Carolina is running for governor, entering a GOP primary in which competition for President Donald Trump's endorsement — and the backing of his base of supporters — is expected to be fierce. Mace told The Associated Press on Sunday she plans a multi-pronged platform aimed in part at shoring up the state’s criminal justice system, ending South Carolina's income tax, protecting women and children, expanding school choice and vocational education and improving the state's energy options. Official filing for South Carolina’s 2026 elections doesn’t open until March, but several other Republicans have already entered the state’s first truly open governor’s race in 16 years, including Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Both Wilson and Evette have touted their own connections to the Republican president, but Mace — calling herself “Trump in high heels” — said she is best positioned to carry out his agenda in South Carolina, where he has remained popular since his 2016 state primary win helped cement his status as the GOP presidential nominee. Saying she plans to seek his support, Mace pointed to her defense of Trump in an interview that resulted in ABC News agreeing to pay $15 million toward his presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. “No one else in this race can say they've been there for the president like I have, as much as I have and worked as hard as I have to get the president his agenda delivered to him in the White House.” Mace has largely supported Trump, working for his 2016 campaign but levying criticism against him following the Jan. A month after she told the AP in January that she was “seriously considering” a run, Mace went what she called “scorched earth," using a nearly hour-long speech on the U.S. House floor in February to accuse her ex-fiancé of physically abusing her, recording sex acts with her and others without their consent, and conspiring with business associates in acts of rape and sexual misconduct. Mace's ex-fiancé said he “categorically” denied the accusations, and another man Mace mentioned has sued her for defamation, arguing the accusations were a “dangerous mix of falsehoods and baseless accusations.” “I want every South Carolinian to watch me as I fight for my rights as a victim," Mace said, asked if she worried about litigation related to the speech. "I want them to know I will fight just as hard for them as I am fighting for myself.” Mace, 47, was the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, the state’s military college, where her father then served as commandant of cadets. After briefly serving in the state House, in 2020 she became the first Republican woman elected to represent South Carolina in Congress, flipping the 1st District after one term with a Democratic representative.

Lara Trump, host of FOX News Channel's "My View with Lara Trump," right, interviews Charlamagne tha God on Thursday, July 31, 2025, in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Sunday lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God, saying in a social media post that the popular broadcaster "knows nothing about me or what I have done.” Trump’s comments came a day after Charlamagne, whose real name is Lenard McKelvey, criticized Trump on the Fox News show “My View with Lara Trump.” The show is hosted by the president’s daughter-in-law, a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Asked how he would rate Trump’s presidency, the radio host said, “I wouldn’t give it a good rating simply because the least of us are still being impacted the worst.” Trump said on Truth Social that Charlamagne was a “dope” who voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Charlamagne said he personally will benefit from tax breaks approved in Trump’s tax-and-spending law, but said, “There’s going to be so many people that’s hurt by that bill.'' “Anything that takes away Medicaid from people and will put people in a worse financial situation than they were previously in, I’m not for," he added. Charlamagne also predicted that “traditional conservatives" are going to take back the Republican Party from Trump's Make America Great Again movement, citing controversy over Trump's refusal to release files related to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. I think that they know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up, the MAGA base isn’t letting this issue go and for the first time they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base. I think they’re going to do that.” The Epstein case has dominated news coverage in recent weeks after the Justice Department said it will not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. Officials have said Epstein killed himself in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his links to famous people, including Trump and other billionaires. Charlamagne, who co-hosts a nationally syndicated radio show, “The Breakfast Club," told Lara Trump that his criticism of the Republican president was not new, adding that he “gave President Biden the same hell” when he didn't think the Democrat was doing a good job.

Article: ROBERTSON Associated Press , ERIK VERDUZCO Associated Press , and THOMAS BEAUMONT Associated Press People wave their signs during Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley's campaign launch event for North Carolina's open U.S. Speaking at an event held at an old textile mill near Charlotte, Whatley pledged his allegiance to the president, who will be a major focus for both sides in a swing state where Trump had one of his smallest margins of victory last year. Whatley's plan to run became public a week ago, after which Trump said on social media that Whatley would “make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina” and that he would have ”my Complete and Total Endorsement." Whatley got in the race after Lara Trump — the president’s daughter-in-law, a former RNC co-chair with Whatley and a North Carolina native — passed on her own bid. Cooper's entry brings optimism to a party aiming to take back the Senate in 2026 with a net gain of four seats — a tall task in a year when many Senate races are in states Trump won easily in 2024. National Republican campaign strategists say that Cooper’s entry makes North Carolina a more difficult seat for the party to hold, though a Democrat hasn’t won a Senate race in usually competitive North Carolina since 2008. But Whatley spent his launch speech targeting Cooper, accusing him of “offering North Carolina voters an extreme radical-left ideology -- open borders, inflationary spending and a weak America.” “I believe in a better North Carolina and a stronger America," he added. Whatley joked in April to an Iowa audience that Trump was so pleased with his work as chair that he offered Whatley any job that he wanted in Trump's administration, as long as he stayed on as chair. But Whatley also will have to defend portions of Trump's new law that includes pulling back on Medicaid, which North Carolina officials say threatens expansion coverage for hundreds of thousands of people. insider and big oil lobbyist who supports policies that are ripping health care away from North Carolinians and raising costs for middle class families.” In a news release, Cooper campaign manager Jeff Allen added that Cooper has a "record of putting partisanship aside to get results for North Carolina.” At the close of his tenure as state chairman, Whatley highlighted his efforts to encourage early voting and protect “election integrity,” as well as online fundraising and volunteer training.

Article: Democrats are launching a nationwide summer blitz designed to force vulnerable Republicans to defend President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill — especially Medicaid cuts that'll leave millions of Americans without health care coverage NEW YORK -- Democrats are launching a nationwide summer blitz designed to force vulnerable Republicans to defend President Donald Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts bill — especially Medicaid cuts that will leave millions of Americans without health care coverage. Republican leaders in Washington, meanwhile, have encouraged their members to promote more popular aspects of the bill during smaller controlled appearances where GOP officials are less likely to face difficult questions or protests. The party's message will be reinforced by online advertising and billboard trucks at state and county fairs in the coming days targeting vulnerable House Republicans in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey, among other states. "Democrats will be holding events, highlighting Republican hypocrisy, and ensuring Americans across the country know exactly who is responsible for taking away health care, food, construction jobs, and nursing homes in order to give massive handouts to billionaires.” The massive Republican-backed tax and spending package that Trump called “big, beautiful” and signed into law on July 4 may ultimately become the defining issue of next year's midterm elections, which will decide control of Congress for Trump's final two years in office. The new law will add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits through 2034, leave more than another 10 million people without health insurance and leave millions of others without food stamps, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The memo encourages Republicans to be proactive in selling Trump's bill during the August recess, although the National Republican Campaign Committee suggests its members focus on tax cuts in smaller settings they can control. Among the NRCC's suggestions outlined in the memo: “Visit a local hospital and discuss how you voted for no tax on overtime,” “stop by a restaurant to highlight your vote on no tax on tips” and “work the counter at a local store and chat about your work to lower costs.” The monthlong August break “is a critical opportunity to continue to define how this legislation will help every voter and push back on Democrat fearmongering,” the Republican memo says. Democrats are planning a decidedly more public campaign this month than their Republican rivals, although they'll also offer “multi-day intensive bootcamps” as part of a training program for political operatives and community leaders.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shake hands after reaching a trade deal at the Trump Turnberry golf course in Turnberry, Scotland Sunday, July 27, 2025. But when Trump signed the order Thursday night imposing new tariffs, the start date of the punishing import taxes was pushed back seven days so the tariff schedule could be updated. The change in tariffs on 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands was potentially welcome news to countries that had not yet reached a deal with the U.S. Trump told NBC News in a Thursday night interview the tariffs process was going “very well, very smooth." But even as the Republican president insisted these new rates would stay in place, he added: “It doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.” Trump has promised that his tax hikes on the nearly $3 trillion in goods imported to the United States will usher in newfound wealth, launch a cavalcade of new factory jobs, reduce the budget deficits and, simply, get other countries to treat America with more respect. appeals court on Thursday heard arguments on whether Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an “emergency” under a 1977 law to charge the tariffs, allowing him to avoid congressional approval. import taxes will be historically high and complex, and that, because these deals are so vague and unfinished, policy uncertainty will remain very elevated,” said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of economics at the Cato Institute. Trump negotiated trade frameworks over the past few weeks with the EU, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines — allowing the president to claim victories as other nations sought to limit his threat of charging even higher tariff rates. Switzerland and Norway were among the dozens of countries that did not know what their tariff rate would be, while Trump agreed after a Thursday morning phone call to keep Mexico’s tariffs at 25% for a 90-day negotiating period. While the Trump administration has sought to challenge China's manufacturing dominance, it is separately in extended trade talks with that country, which faces a 30% tariff and is charging a 10% retaliatory rate on the U.S. The Trump White House has pointed to the increase in federal revenues as a sign that the tariffs will reduce the budget deficit, with $127 billion in customs and duties collected so far this year — about $70 billion more than last year. On Thursday, one crucial measure of inflation, known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that prices have climbed 2.6% over the 12 months that ended in June, a sign that inflation may be accelerating as the tariffs flow through the economy. The prospect of higher inflation from the tariffs has caused the Federal Reserve to hold off on additional cuts to its benchmark rates, a point of frustration for Trump, who on Truth Social, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a “TOTAL LOSER.” But ahead of Trump's tariffs, Powell seemed to suggest that the tariffs had put the U.S.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before walking across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Aug. (AP) — An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year. It was not clear what basis exists to contend that Smith's investigations were political in nature or that he violated the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, had earlier this week encouraged the office to scrutinize Smith's activities and had alleged that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president Kamala Harris, both Democrats. Smith brought two cases against Trump, one accusing him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the other of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both were brought in 2023, well over a year before the 2024 presidential election, and indictments in the two cases cited what Smith and his team described as clear violations of well-established federal law. There was no immediate indication that the same office investigating Smith had opened investigations into the Justice Department special counsels who were appointed by Garland to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Trump selected as his replacement Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host who has praised criminally charged influencer Andrew Tate as a “extraordinary human being” and promoted the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged.

Article: North Carolina Senate race sets up as a fight over who would be a champion for the middle class Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley speaks during his campaign launch event for North Carolina's open U.S. In announcing his candidacy for the Senate on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley credited President Donald Trump with fulfilling campaign promises to working Americans and painted Cooper as a puppet of the left. Still, Cooper’s opening message that he hears the worries of working families has given Democrats in North Carolina and beyond a sense that they can reclaim their place as the party that champions the middle class. They think it's a message that could help them pick up a Senate seat, and possibly more, in next year's midterm elections, which in recent years have typically favored the party out of power. It’s time for that to change.” Cooper's plainspoken appeal may represent just the latest effort by Democrats to find their way back to power, but it has some thinking they've finally found their footing after last year's resounding losses. “I think it would do us all a lot of good to take a close look at his example,” said Larry Grisolano, a Chicago-based Democratic media strategist and former adviser to President Barack Obama. Whatley, a former North Carolina GOP chairman and close Trump ally, used his Thursday announcement that he was entering the race to hail the president as the true champion of the middle class. These are the North Carolina values that I will champion if elected.” Still, the decision by Cooper, who held statewide office for 24 years and has never lost an election, makes North Carolina a potential bright spot in a midterm election cycle when Democrats must net four seats to retake the majority — and when most of the 2026 Senate contests are in states Trump won comfortably last November. He echoed the themes raised in the Senate Leadership Fund ad, which noted Cooper's vetoes in the Republican-led legislature of measures popular with conservatives, such as banning gender-affirming health care for minors and requiring county sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration officials. “And while he’s not going to win it, he knows how to talk to those folks.” As with most Democrats, Cooper's winning coalition includes the state's largest cities and suburbs. “We have to acknowledge what people are going through right now and what they are feeling, that he hears you and understands what you feel.” Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century, a group that conducts research for an initiative called the Working Class Project, said Cooper struck a tone that other Democrats should try to match. “I do think it's a model, especially his focus on affordability.” “We can attack Republicans all day long, but unless we have candidates who can really embody that message, we're not going to be able to take back power.” ___ Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Article: speaks as President Donald Trump listens at an event to promote his proposal to improve Americans' access to their medical records in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. The president "wants to ensure America’s future generations are strong, healthy, and successful," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, and that all young Americans "have the opportunity to emphasize healthy, active lifestyles — creating a culture of strength and excellence for years to come.” In a late afternoon ceremony at the White House, Trump intends to sign an order that reestablishes the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, as well as the fitness test, to be administered by his health secretary, Robert F. In 2012, the assessment evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the government said “moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student’s health.” The Youth Fitness Test, according to a Health and Human Services Department website last updated in 2023 but still online Thursday, “minimizes comparisons between children and instead supports students as they pursue personal fitness goals for lifelong health.” Expected to join Trump at the event are a number of prominent athletes, including some who have faced controversy. They include pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau, a Trump friend; kicker Harrison Butker of the Kansas City Chiefs; Swedish golfer Annika Sorenstam; WWE chief content officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque, the son-in-law of Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon; and former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, a registered sex offender. The NFL distanced itself from comments Butker made last year during a commencement address at a Kansas college, when he said most of the women receiving degrees were probably more excited about getting married and having children than entering the workforce and that some Catholic leaders were “pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America." Butker also assailed Pride month and railed against Democratic President Joe Biden’s stance on abortion. Butker later formed a political action committee designed to encourage Christians to vote for what the PAC describes as “traditional values." Sorenstam faced backlash for accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump on Jan.

Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity.” ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.

But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday.

United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the issues are complex, but the crisis is “really spiraling” and there's a narrow pathway to a treaty. About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty — companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L’Oréal — support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The State Department says it supports provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment. “If the negotiations are to succeed, the agreement must be aimed at protecting the environment from plastic pollution, and the agreement should recognize the importance plastics play in our economies,” the State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press. Tracey Campbell, an executive vice president at the plastics and chemicals company LyondellBasell and vice chair of the executive committee of the World Plastics Council, said she'll ask negotiators to “find a way to agree on a few things and get started” and then build from there.

(Youenn Kerdavid/Sea Shepherd via AP) MIAMI -- Officials have shut down early the remote krill fishery near Antarctica after trawling for the tiny crustacean — a vital food source for whales that also helps fight climate change — exceeded the seasonal catch limit for the first time. The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world's southernmost fishery. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit. The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill’s Omega-3 rich oil – for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements — have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill — until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.

Article: President Donald Trump has a pattern of dismissing or altering data that reflects poorly on him In rejecting the jobs report, Trump follows his own playbook of discrediting unfavorable data WASHINGTON -- When the coronavirus surged during President Donald Trump’s first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. And on Friday, when the July jobs report revisions showed a distressed economy, Trump had an answer: He fired the official in charge of the data and called the report of a sharp slowdown in hiring “phony.” Trump has a go-to playbook if the numbers reveal uncomfortable realities, and that’s to discredit or conceal the figures and to attack the messenger — all of which can hurt the president's efforts to convince the world that America is getting stronger. “Our democratic system and the strength of our private economy depend on the honest flow of information about our economy, our government and our society,” said Douglas Elmendorf, a Harvard University professor who was formerly director of the Congressional Budget Office. It emphasized that Goldman Sachs found that the two-month revisions on the jobs report were the largest since 1968, outside of a recession, and that should be a source of concern regarding the integrity of the data. Trump has a long history of dismissing data when it reflects poorly on him and extolling or even fabricating more favorable numbers, a pattern that includes his net worth, his family business, election results and government figures: — Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing loans. Trump won the 2016 presidential election by clinching the Electoral College, but he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, a sore spot that led him to falsely claim that millions of immigrants living in the country illegally had cast ballots. Trump later displayed a map in the Oval Office that had been altered with a black Sharpie — his signature pen — to include Alabama in the potential path of the storm. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’” While Trump's actions have drawn outcry from economists, scientists and public interest groups, Elmendorf noted that Trump's actions regarding economic data could be tempered by Congress, which could put limits on Trump by whom he chooses to lead federal agencies, for example. They have not exercised that power, but they could.” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at the size of the downward revisions in the jobs report (a combined 258,000 reduction in May and June) to suggest that the report had credibility issues. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who oversaw the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis during the Biden administration, stressed that revisions to the jobs data are standard. “We want timely data because policymakers and businesses and investors need to make decisions with the best data that's available, but we also want accuracy.” Kolko stressed the importance in ensuring that federal statistics are trustworthy not just for government policymakers but for the companies trying to gauge the overall direction of the economy when making hiring and investment choices. Before Trump ordered the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, the White House rapid response social media account reposted a statement by Vice President JD Vance noting that native-born citizens were getting jobs and immigrants were not, drawing from data in the household tables in the jobs report. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer also trumpeted the findings on native-born citizens, noting on Fox Business Network's “Varney & Co.” that they are accounting "for all of the job growth, and that’s key.” During his first run for the presidency, Trump criticized the economic data as being fake only to fully embrace the positive numbers shortly after he first entered the White House in 2017. The White House initially said NASA would post the reports in compliance with a 1990 law, but the agency later said it would not because any legal obligations were already met by having reports submitted to Congress. The White House maintains that it has operated with complete openness, posting a picture of Trump on Monday on social media with the caption, “The Most Transparent President in History.” In the picture, Trump had his back to the camera and was covered in shadows, visibly blocking out most of the light in front of him.

The Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, estimates that as of June, European countries had provided 72 billion euros ($83 billion) worth of military aid since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, compared to $65 billion in U.S. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said that “American air defense systems and munitions, in particular, are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself.” Announcing the deliveries Monday, he said Russia’s attacks are “pure terror, intended to break Ukraine.” Germany said Friday that it will deliver two more Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine in the coming days.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, left, and Federal Aviation Administration administrator Bryan Bedford, right, watch a drone flight demonstration following a news conference on new drone regulations, Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) A new federal rule proposed Tuesday would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process. The federal government had already approved 657 waivers to allow companies such as Amazon and major utilities to do this in certain circumstances, but the waiver process made it difficult. “This draft rule is a critical step toward enabling drone operations that will enhance safety, transform commercial services, and strengthen public safety with drones as a force multiplier," Michael Robbins, president & CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said in a statement. These out of sight flights will only be allowed under 400 feet, and there are precautions to ensure they don't disrupt aviation and cause problems around airports, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “While the technology has rapidly advanced over the last decade, our regulatory framework in the United States has failed to keep pace,” said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance group. “Drone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crewed aircraft.” President Donald Trump issued executive orders in June directing the Transportation Department to quickly get this rule out. Amazon is one of the companies that received a waiver allowing it to use drones this way for some of its deliveries in College Station, Texas, as it develops the technology. Flytrex co-founder and CEO Yariv Bash called the proposed rule “a foundational milestone that paves the way for drone delivery to scale across more communities in the U.S.” “This rule is a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of drone delivery and ensuring its long-term business viability nationwide,” Bash said. The war in Ukraine has highlighted how drones could be used in a military or terrorist attack — a concern as the World Cup and Olympics approach in the U.S. And White House officials said drones are being used to smuggle drugs over the border, and there are concerns about the potential for a disastrous collision between a drone and an airliner around an airport. Duffy and Bedford said they hope having regulations in place can help prevent problems like earlier this year when a small drone collided with a “Super Scooper” plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The man admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. And that’s when it struck the “Super Scooper.” This rule applies directly to commercial and recreational drone operators who must apply to be able to fly drones out of sight.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package. The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO. At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.” Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting. Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajection of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S.

Article: (AP Photo/Lisa Leutner, File) NEW YORK -- A group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries has agreed to boost oil production, a move some believe could lower oil and gasoline prices, citing a steady global economic outlook and low oil inventories. The countries boosting output, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, had been participating in voluntary production cuts, initially made in November 2023, which were scheduled to be phased out by September 2026. But Brent crude oil, which is considered a global benchmark, has been trading near $70 per barrel, which could be due to a potential loss of Russian oil on the market and a large rise in crude inventories in China, according to research firm Clearview Energy Partners. “President Trump has not obviously relented from his threat to sanction Russian energy if the Kremlin does not reach a peace deal with Ukraine as of August 7, potentially via “secondary tariffs” on buyers,” Clearview Energy Partners said in an analyst note Sunday.

Article: and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. “China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,” China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable — after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the "Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.” “We don’t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff," Bessent said. “Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance” for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China’s consistent official stance,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as “the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington." He said Trump has made it clear he wants a “headline-grabbing deal” with Xi, “so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal‑breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay." Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's “strategic solidarity” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested." Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Trump has been clear that it is “not acceptable” for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia. “People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,” Miller said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said the U.S. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that “knowingly” buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia. "The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China — a communist dictatorship — buying oil below market price from Putin’s Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Graham said in a June statement.

Article: adults are feeling some stress about the cost of groceries, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs remain widespread NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread. About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a “major” source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a “minor” source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as “buy now, pay later” services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care. While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses — such as veterinary care for her dogs — in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders. “I'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.” Bland's monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.” According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans — those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year — say the cost of groceries is a “major” stressor. adults say housing is a “major” source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care. About 3 in 10 say credit card debt is a “major” source of stress, while about 2 in 10 say that about the cost of child care and student debt. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the cost of housing is a “major” source of stress, compared with about half of Black adults and about 4 in 10 white adults. Shandal LeSure, 43, who works as a receptionist for a rehabilitation hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and makes between $85,000 and $100,000 a year, said she's started shopping for groceries at less expensive stores. adults overall say they've used “buy now, pay later” services such as Afterpay or Klarna to purchase groceries, entertainment, restaurant meals or meal delivery, or medical or dental care, according to the poll.

(Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute via AP) WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic. The findings “solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean," said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study. Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study. “It’s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,” said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was “really smart and significant.” Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. “They’re voracious eaters.” With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population – and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations -- and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to “the rainforests of the ocean.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

The botched Starliner demo forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to switch to SpaceX to get back from the space station more than nine months after departing on what should have been a weeklong trip. “What we learn on these missions is what’s going to get us to the moon and then from the moon to Mars, which is I think the direction that NASA has to be,” Duffy said in a NASA interview. We want to claim that real estate for ourselves and our partners.” To save money in light of tight budgets, NASA is looking to increase its space station stays from six months to eight months, a move already adopted by Russia's space agency. Astronauts would remain on board until the last four to six months of the station's life to handle any breakdowns, with the empty outpost plunging into the Pacific by late 2030 or early 2031.

According to archaeologist José Aliaga, the vessels’ iconography and their black, white, and red colors “allow us to establish a connection with the pre-Incan Chancay culture,’ which is approximately 1,000 to 1,470 years old.” Aliaga told The Associated Press that the individual was found wrapped in a torn bundle, in a sitting position with his legs against his chest, and his team will continue cleaning the remains. “Lima is unique among Latin American capitals,” Aliaga said, “in that various archaeological finds are unearthed during nearly every civil project.” The Peruvian capital, a city of 10 million people, has more than 400 archaeological sites from the Inca era, the 15th century, or earlier, from the pre-Inca period, according to the Ministry of Culture. “But now I know that people older than the Incas have lived there…it feels so exciting.” “It is very common to find archaeological remains on the Peruvian coast, including Lima, mainly funerary elements: tombs, burials, and, among these, mummified individuals,” said Pieter Van Dalen, dean of the College of Archaeologists of Peru.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) MOSCOW -- Russia’s space chief has visited the United States to discuss plans for continued cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA’s acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years. Dmitry Bakanov, the director of the state space corporation Roscosmos, met Thursday with NASA's new acting administrator, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, on a visit to attend the planned launch of a U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew to the space station. Roscosmos said Bakanov and Duffy discussed "further work on the International Space Station, cooperation on lunar programs, joint exploration of deep space and continued cooperation on other space projects.” Once bitter rivals in the space race during the Cold War, Roscosmos and NASA cooperated on the space station and other projects. As Russia has become increasingly reliant on China for its energy exports and imports of key technology amid Western sanctions, Roscosmos has started cooperation with China on its prospective lunar mission. Speaking to Russian reporters after the talks with Duffy, Bakanov said that they agreed to keep working on keeping the space station in operation to the end of the decade. “Our experts will now start working on those issues in details,” Bakanov said, praising Duffy for giving a green light for those contacts “despite geopolitical tensions.” The Russian space chief added that he and Duffy will report the results of the meeting to Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump to secure their blessing for potential space cooperation.

Ebenhack, File) FILE - Dustin Holmes, second from right, holds hands with his girlfriend, Hailey Morgan, while returning to their flooded home with her children Aria Skye Hall, 7, right, and Kyle Ross, 4, in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Sept. Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. "But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.” The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. "Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.” Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said — increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms. A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program’s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set “in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to “ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.” The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. “Loss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.” He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss.

Article: Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer. Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop. Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests — players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,” said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. “I have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.” Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. “There’s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,” said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. I’m a completionist, so I want everything and that’s what’s fun for me,” said Leah Ashe, a YouTuber who plays Grow a Garden and other popular games to an audience of 5.3 million. Get online!’ The seed shop updates every five minutes, so there’s always something pulling you back into the game.” For Roblox, which has faced a backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming service, Grow a Garden has served as something of a reprieve — along with new safety measures such as chat restrictions and privacy tools. Bozdech said that “if you have the right supervision and guidance,” Roblox can be a positive experience for kids, allowing them to create their own designs or practice coding, for instance.

The legislation, which has been approved by both houses of parliament earlier this month, makes what it describes as “deliberately searching for and accessing extremist materials” online punishable by a fine of up to the equivalent of $60. In Russia, the official definition of extremist activity is extremely broad and includes opposition groups like the Anti-Corruption Foundation, created by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and the “international LGBTQ+ movement.” It’s not clear how authorities will track down violators. Multiple independent news outlets and rights groups have been shut down, labeled as “foreign agents” or outlawed as “undesirable.” Hundreds of activists and critics of the Kremlin have faced criminal charges.

Bill Lee declined Monday to grant a reprieve, clearing the way for Byron Black’s execution after a legal battle and ongoing uncertainty about whether the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator will shock his heart when the lethal drug takes effect. Twenty-seven men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. Kelley Henry, Black's attorney, said the execution could become a “grotesque spectacle.” The legal case also spurred a reminder that most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of health care ethics. Linette Bell, whose sister and two nieces were killed, recently told WKRN-TV: “He didn’t have mercy on them, so why should we have mercy on him?” In recent years, Black's legal team has unsuccessfully tried to get a new hearing over whether he is intellectually disabled and ineligible for the death penalty under U.S. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." In Funk's attempt, he focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

Article: The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan Afghan children wait in line to get a polio vaccine in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, May 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Shafiullah Kakar) KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

Article: DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car. The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards. Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon. The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035. But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. “With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement. Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits. Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.” It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years.

Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,” the statement said, adding; “Vaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.” The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past.

Article: West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class In this image from video, a student eats a meatball sub sandwich during lunch in Parkersburg, W.Va., on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. “Where do we start?” Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, “but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.” More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects. Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. “In rural West Virginia, I don’t think it’s really on radar screens.” In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was “really good.” Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: “Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Emily Elconin) Trinity Wilson, 12, holds her five-month-old cousin, Jaylen, as she and her family walk around the Flint Rx Kids Baby Parade event on July 25, 2025 in on Applewood Campus in Flint, Michigan. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played. It was called a “baby parade.” The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump’s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate. Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up. “They are helping us prove that this is possible.” Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. “And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.” A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate. But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care — not just the number of babies being born here. “No wonder people aren’t having children and our birth rates are going down.” The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 “baby bonuses,” a policy similar to Rx Kids.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump. Vinay Prasad “did not want to be a distraction” and was stepping down from his role as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator “to spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday. Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA’s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines. Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder. During Trump’s first term he signed the “ Right to Try ” law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.

Article: (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) NEW YORK -- The 17 experts who were ousted from a government vaccine committee last month say they have little faith in what the panel has become, and have outlined possible alternative ways to make U.S. In a commentary published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former panel members wrote that Kennedy — a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders. The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's “destabilizing decisions." The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy’s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.” Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations.

Article: (Seth Pincus, Elizabeth Fischer, Austin Athman/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH via AP, File) LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission. In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is “highly effective” and “considered to be of major public health interest.” Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. UNAIDS chief Byanyima has previously suggested that President Donald Trump make a deal with Gilead to produce and license its “magical” prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.

A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections — by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services. “It is a shame that these democrat attorney generals seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.” Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. “Either we have to comply and violate Planned Parenthood’s constitutional rights and then push people to alternative providers that don’t exist, who don’t have the capacity to pick up the slack, or we have to spend upwards of $6 million or more to cover (those services),” said William Tong, Connecticut's Democratic attorney general.

Article: without legal permission are either limiting or ending the programs because of significant budget concerns A woman and her 16-month-old son wait to see a doctor at a CommuniCARE+OLE clinic Thursday, June 26, 2025, in Davis, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister — a nurse in Mexico — for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband’s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California. Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. “Having the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.” At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. “I feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you’ll burst,” Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they’re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year. CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, “but truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.” “People are going to die. “It’s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that’s happening right now.” A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state’s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals. "When we looked at the state budget, the dollars were not there to support what was passed and what was being spent.” Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage, and adults lacking permanent legal status can buy private health insurance. But he anticipated other providers who billed through the program could close, he said, adding: “Things can become unstable very quickly.” State lawmakers said California’s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues — a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027. Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor’s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions. “If it comes to the point where my husband gets sick and his life is at risk, well then, obviously, we have to choose his life.” ___ Associated Press journalist Godofredo Vasquez in San Francisco contributed to this report.

Article: is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life US organ donation system faces scrutiny and changes after reports of disturbing near-misses WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized. “Hopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,” Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor. The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. But the federal probe – concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday’s hearing -- cited a “concerning pattern of risk” in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs. Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients. Adding to the complexity, two government agencies — HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process. At issue is how doctors are sure when it’s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient — and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone – family, hospital staff or organ donation staff – can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient’s eligibility. Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff “a clear understanding” of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.

Article: Maura Healey says the state will provide money to improve public safety staffing in Fall River, the after meeting with city officials about the response to a fire at an assisted-living facility that killed 10 people After deadly fire, Massachusetts city will get over $1 million to boost emergency staffing FILE - Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey approaches a news conference to face reporters, July 14, 2025, near the Gabriel House assisted living facility, behind, following a fire that started late Sunday in Fall River, Mass. Maura Healey said Tuesday the state would provide money to improve public safety staffing for the city of Fall River in the wake of last week's fire at an assisted-living facility that killed 10 people. The fire in the blue-collar city in southern Massachusetts remains under investigation, but it has highlighted the lack of regulations governing assisted-living facilities that often care for low-income or disabled residents. Healey said last week that a state agency that ensures regulatory compliance at assisted-living residences will investigate all 273 such facilities in Massachusetts to make sure they are prepared to protect residents during emergencies. A resident of Gabriel House filed a lawsuit Monday alleging the facility was not properly managed, staffed or maintained, that residency rules were not enforced “and emergency response procedures were not put in place.” Trapped in his room during the fire, Steven Oldrid was in an “already compromised physical condition” when he suffered smoke inhalation and lost consciousness, according to the complaint filed in Bristol County Superior Court. Public injury law firm Morgan & Morgan also said last week it was hired to investigate the fire by the family of one of the residents killed at Gabriel House. Morgan & Morgan Communications Manager Emily Walsh said the law firm had already begun looking into whether the facility was adequately staffed and provided proper training to staff, as well as any potential code violations and possible failures of fire safety equipment. Gabriel House issued a statement Monday emphasizing the importance of finding out “exactly what caused this catastrophe, and if there were factors that made it worse.” The statement said the facility placed a premium on residents’ safety.

Article: Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot Theo Gantos pours water from his spigot in the North Morris Estates mobile home park, Thursday, April 24, 2025, in Mount Morris Township, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful “forever chemicals” years before the federal government acted. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan — among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases. The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state’s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said. John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules. And what we’ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they’ve elected not to.” Mobile home parks without a license are “essentially operating unregulated,” Cherry said. A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 — new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though “the problem is, I’m not resourced for that.” The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year’s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable.

Article: Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah’s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination. More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans’ water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can’t always count on those basic protections. A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. “If you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the ’70s when they were starting, it was, ‘Well, as long as the source … is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it’ll be fine.’ And that’s just not how it works,” Smith said. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee — scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. That means they’re “halfway homeowners,” said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. “It wasn’t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, ‘I don’t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn’t get in my mouth because I don’t know what’s in it,’” she said. I haven’t been able to do that for over a year.” Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there. “People don’t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,” Silva said. The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. When Smith first searched Utah’s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. One July day in 2021, officials with the EPA were out investigating sky-high arsenic levels in the tap water at Oasis Mobile Home Park in the Southern California desert when they realized the problem went way beyond just one place. “It was literally us driving around and going, ‘Wait a minute, there’s a bunch of mobile home parks!’” said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA’s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region. Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks. ”“It’s like spaghetti laying in the ground.” After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that “were barely buried. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner. In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, “I just couldn’t get clear answers.” Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado’s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. “It seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Birth rates are generally declining for women in most age groups — and that doesn’t seem likely to change in the near future, said Karen Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina.

(AP Photo/Farah Abdi Warsameh, File) KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion — some two-thirds of the continent's population — in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don’t reach that mark, the report said. An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that “contrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa” and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said. According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks — in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance — were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 “hunger hot spots.” That report, by FAO and WFP, mentioned Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories as being of the “highest concern level.” Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen were classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people faced or were projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is “concerning,” driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.

Article: A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity. But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges — until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations. Will you marry me?” Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva — whom he met in 2021 — that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity. Any small stimulus — a smell, a breeze, a color — can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv. "It just feels less intense.” A 2014 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Israeli ex-POWs and combat veterans tracked over 35 years had higher mortality rates, chronic illnesses and worse self-rated health — conditions partly tied to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.

When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next.

How special is that?” A conversation between Winfrey and Russo, held recently at a Starbucks in Seattle, can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel and on other outlets where podcasts are aired.

Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall." James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. "It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost.

Article: Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, “Different Night Same Rodeo.” “I don't know what I'm doing,” Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. “I just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I’m trying to write other songs that have already been written.” So, he took a step back, and asked himself: “What am I trying to do with my music? “So just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I’ve been through.” On “Different Night Same Rodeo,” those stories are told in big-hearted ballads (“Hell or High Water”), good time stomps (“New to Country”) and varied collaborations, including with country star Luke Combs (“Backup Plan”), the rising pop voice the Kid LAROI (“Lost”), and Diplo (“Ashes”). He's always been open to such eclectic collaborations, anchored in his raspy, charismatic tone — Zimmerman's highest charting song to date is “All The Way,” a hip-hop-country hybrid he features on with rapper BigXThaPlug. “And I want it to feel real, because it comes across not real when it’s not.” For an artist who describes himself as “dealing with a little bit of impostor syndrome,” he seems to know, at least intuitively, what works for himself and his fans.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File) LOS ANGELES -- Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station’s empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy “WKRP in Cincinnati,” died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday. Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynold s in the 1983 comedy “Stroker Ace,” and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before their messy breakup in 1994. Their son, Quinton Reynolds, was “the best decision that we ever made in our entire relationship,” she said during the unveiling of a bronze bust at Reynolds’ Hollywood grave site in 2021. Anderson detailed their tumultuous marriage in the 1995 autobiography, “My Life in High Heels,” which she said was about “the growth of a woman, a woman who survives." “I think if you’re going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,” Anderson told the AP while promoting the book. Most of her career was spent on the small screen with early guest parts in the 1970s on “S.W.A.T.” and “Police Woman.” After “WKRP,” Anderson starred in the short-lived comedy series “Easy Street” and appeared in made-for-TV movies including “A Letter to Three Wives” and “White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd.” In 2023 she co-starred in Lifetime’s “Ladies Of The 80s: A Divas Christmas” with Linda Gray, Donna Mills, Morgan Fairchild and Nicollette Sheridan. I’m just devastated to hear this." Anderson is survived by Flick, her daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.

(Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

(Elizabeth Williams via AP) NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed. Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request. He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week. Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

Article: It hasn't been easy NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy — a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues — there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans — Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film “Sinners” earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album “Ain't Done with the Blues.” It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,” he tells The Associated Press over the phone, “I do the best I can to keep the blues alive.” He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons “Ain't Done with the Blues” is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten — like on the album closer “Talk to Your Daughter,” a rendition of the J.B. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of “Sinners.” Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, describes the current moment as a “resurgence of the blues,” following “Sinners.” “Several artists featured on the film’s soundtrack, which includes works from real-life blues, folk and country musicians, saw spikes the week of the film’s theatrical release,” he explains. “They ain’t never gonna come in and say, ‘I heard it on the radio.’” That's part of the reason why Guy decided to participate in the movie in the first place. “I hope this will give the blues a boost, because my worry right now is, like I said, a young person don’t know how good a gumbo is — you’ve got to taste it.” For now, he's excited to see how people respond to his new album, “Ain't Done with the Blues” — but he's not listening to it.

(DreamWorks Animation/Universal Pictures via AP) The good news for fans of “The Bad Guys” is the new sequel is stellar. Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days — amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. “I'm just asking for a chance.” A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron — so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew — Danielle Brooks’ lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova’s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne’s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on “Poker Face.” These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever — or lazy — joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot. There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire — voice acted by Colin Jost — who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a “24-carat catastrophe.” The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. Based on Aaron Blabey’s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil — like asking if DNA determines behavior — as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. (Another thing to chew on: If “The Bad Guys 2” is a worse sequel, does that make “The Bad Guys” good?) When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a “The Bad Guys 3.” (There's going to be a “The Bad Guys 3.”) The joy of “The Bad Guys” was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like “Ocean’s 11.” This time, the “Fast & Furious” series gets mocked, as does “Silence of the Lambs,” “Men in Black” and maybe “Moonraker,” which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: “We've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!” The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers — the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time — but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag’n’Bone Man. It means the folks behind “The Bad Guys 2” reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but — c'mon, everyone — they didn't make it count.

Article: Reneé Rapp's second album, “Bite Me,” gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far NEW YORK -- Reneé Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, “Bite Me,” from the start. “I wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.” Her first album, 2023's “Snow Angel, ” had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R & B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, “Leave Me Alone,” is strikingly open — clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO’s “Sex Lives of College Girls,” the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of “Mean Girls,” and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of “Snow Angel.” Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, “Mad.” (“That's a Rapp!” the headline read.) “It really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people’s expectations of me,” Rapp says of the album. “And then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.” Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage — “I write lyrics in the way that I talk,” she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on “Leave Me Alone” is countered by the ache of “That's So Funny,” which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals. The track, she says, is also just funny: “Who better to put on that than like the funniest person alive?” The album's mix of emotions — heartache followed by the rush of a new crush, the impostor syndrome that accompanies the thrill of success — is something the AP Breakthrough Entertainer alum has been exploring since her 2022 EP, “Everything to Everyone.” She wants listeners to feel the conflict, too — and know that they aren't alone in experiencing it. “Because World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can’t not be there.” She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. “Right now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that’s the time to be really loud.” Rapp will launch the North American leg of her “Bite Me” tour at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater in September before making stops at New York's Madison Square Garden and as a headliner at the Toronto stop of the All Things Go Festival. “It’s really easy to obsess over everything and be constantly lost in your head.” Giving them a glimpse into hers, she hopes, is empowering — and fun: “It’s just, it feels like a big party that like everybody wants in on.”

Article: Two Chinese nationals in California have been arrested and charged with the illegal shipment of tens of millions of dollars' worth of AI chips, including from Nvidia , the Department of Justice said Tuesday. Chuan Geng, 28, and Shiwei Yang, 28, exported the sensitive chips and other technology to China from October 2022 through July 2025 without obtaining the required licenses, the DOJ said. According to the DOJ, law enforcement searched ALX Solutions' office and seized phones belonging to Geng and Yang, which revealed incriminating communications between the defendants, including those about evading U.S. According to a report from the Financial Times last month, at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's chips entered China after Donald Trump tightened chip export controls earlier this year.

Article: The weaker-than-expected result is particularly noticeable because some of Snap's social media and online ad peers, such as Reddit , have beaten analyst estimates for ARPU during this earnings season. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in an investor letter that the company's "topline growth" was affected by a bungled update to its adverting platform that has since been addressed, the "timing of Ramadan" and the "effects of the de minimis changes," referring to President Donald Trump's trade policies. Spiegel said the update, made to improve advertiser performance, resulted in some ad campaigns clearing "the auction at substantially reduced prices." Now that Snap has "reverted this change," the company's "advertising revenue growth has improved as advertisers adjust their bid strategies to achieve their objectives," the executive wrote. Spiegel said in the investor letter that it will be "distributing" its engineering teams to "directly support" its business functions, resulting in its core applications team reporting to tech chief Bobby Murphy. "This new, distributed structure will empower our teams to take greater ownership and drive continued innovation for our community and advertising partners." Eric Young, Snap's senior vice president of engineering who joined the social media company in 2023 from Google , is leaving the company to "pursue a new opportunity," Spiegel said in the letter. Last Thursday, Amazon reported second-quarter earnings in which its online ad sales rose 23% year over year to $15.69 billion, while Reddit reported second-quarter revenue that jumped 78% year over year to $500 million.

Article: "I want to acknowledge the great deal of interest in Opendoor lately and that we're grateful for it," Wheeler said, even as the stock sank more than 20% after hours. "We appreciate your enthusiasm for what we're building, and we're listening intently to your feedback." Prior to its recent surge, Opendoor's stock had been mostly abandoned, falling as low as 51 cents in late June. The situation was so dire that the company was considering a reverse split that could lift the price of each share by as much 50 times as a potential way to keep its Nasdaq listing. Much of the stock's bounce in the past six weeks was spurred by hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who announced in July that his firm had taken a position in Opendoor. "Persistently high mortgage rates continue to suppress buyer demand, leading to lower clearance and record new listings." Wheeler highlighted Opendoor's effort to expand its business beyond so-called iBuying and into more of a referrals business that's less capital intensive.

Article: China's curbs on the export of heavy rare earth metals — essential components for motors — sharply increased material costs and disrupted supply chains, driving up the cost of EV production in the U.S. Rivian Automotive reported a higher-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday as disruption in supply of rare earth metals used to make parts of its electric vehicles raised costs and income from credits sold to traditional automakers dwindled. President Donald Trump administration's elimination of penalties for automakers not meeting fuel economy standards has drastically reduced demand for regulatory credits, which companies like Rivian previously sold to traditional automakers to help them avoid emissions fines. The company delivered 10,661 vehicles in the second quarter, marking a 22% decline from the same period a year earlier, as Rivian limited production to prepare for its 2026 model year launch. The company shut down its plant for a week in the second quarter and will pause production in the second half of 2025 to integrate key production elements and prepare for the R2 SUV launch next year. The $7,500 federal EV tax credit expires at the end of September, eliminating a key competitive advantage that has driven electric vehicle demand, but analysts anticipate a surge in third-quarter sales as consumers rush to purchase EVs before losing access to the incentive.

Article: Utilities are emerging as a hot play in 2025 as investors take notice of their role in powering the artificial intelligence movement – and many of the names also happen to pay attractive dividends. "For the power sector we expect significant tailwinds in the second half of 2025," said Bank of America analyst Ross Fowler in a late June report, pointing to the likelihood of continued growth in electricity demand. "Despite significant positive returns so far this year, we continue to believe the power stocks have data center related catalysts across the second half." In addition, dividend-paying stocks are looking more favorable for investors who are on the prowl for income, anticipating the day when the yield on risk-free Treasurys declines. To that end, CNBC Pro used FactSet data to screen for names within the XLU ETF that have buy or overweight ratings from at least 51% of the analysts covering them, and a dividend yield of at least 1.5%. The provider of power and natural gas in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Rhode Island and Virginia reported adjusted earnings of 32 cents on revenue of $2.03 billion in the second quarter against consensus estimates of 39 cents a share and $1.81 billion in revenue. "PPL has visibility to 8% EPS growth with conservative assumptions while preserving an above-average balance sheet." The icing on the cake is a recently announced joint venture between PPL and Blackstone Infrastructure to build natural gas generation to power data centers. "A large fiber network from Chicago through northwest Indiana enhances competitiveness." "Paired with a solid dividend and visible [free cash flow] growth, we view NI as a defensive name with embedded optionality from growth upside," Fowler said. "This includes generation capex from resource plans across its service areas, transmission and data center demand." With the increase in capital spending built into the rate base, "the company reaffirmed its long-term EPS growth rate of 6%-8% and continue to expect to be in the upper half of the range," Crowdell added.

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in a wide-ranging interview that JPMorgan Chase informed him he had 20 days to move "hundreds of millions of dollars in cash" to another bank. Banks generally deny rejecting clientele based on political or religious beliefs, but say they are required to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing financial crimes, including the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, and have faced regulatory pressure related to crypto and other industries that are considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud. "Banking agencies have already taken steps to address issues like reputational risk, and we're hopeful that any forthcoming executive order will reinforce this progress by directing regulators to confront the flawed regulatory framework that gave rise to these concerns," the Bank Policy Institute told CNBC. While Trump on Tuesday mentioned his business, likely referring to his real estate and hospitality conglomerate, it wasn't clear if the events he described were in reference to personal or business accounts, or both.

Even though Eaton raised the midpoint of its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook, management shaved a little off the top end, citing "some lingering macro uncertainties and also tariff question marks." Still, Eaton has a very bright future.

Quarterly Commentary Eaton's Electrical Americas segment — covering electrical and industrial components, as well as various power products — delivered a "triple beat," with better-than-expected revenue, profit, and segment margins.

On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours. so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said.

Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data.

He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil."

Article: The 12-month program is aimed, in part, at visitors from countries with historically high visa overstay rates, according to a temporary final rule posted in the Federal Register on Tuesday. It's the latest move by the Trump administration to tighten immigration laws in the U.S., following a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries in June and a $250 "visa integrity fee" announcement in July. The program applies to leisure and business travelers who need B-1 or B-2 visas to enter the U.S., and who are coming from countries: that have high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient, or that offer Citizenship by Investment without a residency requirement. The report shows that in 2023, of the 1,655 people from Malawi that were expected to exit the U.S, 237 are suspected to have never left the country, while the total overstay rate is estimated at over 14%. That year, of the nearly 3,500 visitors from Zambia that were to leave the U.S., 388 are estimated to have stayed back, with the suspected in-country overstay rate of 10.45%. The report shows several countries with even higher suspected overstay rates, including Chad (49%), Laos (34%), Haiti (31%), Republic of Congo, (29%), Sudan (26%), Djibouti (23%), Myanmar (26%), Eritrea (19%), Yemen (19%), Equatorial Guinea (21%), Burundi (15%), Sierra Leone (15%), Democratic Republic of Congo (15%) and Turkmenistan (15%). It is primarily aimed at accessing the feasibility of processing and discharging bonds, which the government has previously deemed to be "cumbersome." But it will also help ascertain whether bonds compel visitors to comply with their visa terms. Notably, the pilot program provides more details than the $250 "visa integrity fee" announced in July, including when it will start, how it will be implemented, and processes to post and refund bonds amounts. In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that more than 320,000 people overstayed their visas, though this includes travelers who eventually left the country, according to the State Department's visa bond notice.

Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Article: The country's largest private sector employer, Tata Consultancy Services, which employs over half a million IT workers, announced last month that it would cut more than 12,000 jobs from mostly the middle and senior management levels, equating to 2% of its global workforce — in what will be its biggest layoff so far. But that did not quell growing unease within the country, as many viewed the layoffs as a sign of broader and disruptive changes underway in the IT sector, amplified by the growing influence of AI. TCS and its peers have long relied on India's vast pool of low-cost, skilled labor to produce software services, a model now coming under pressure as AI is set to automate repetitive tasks and as global clients demand higher levels of innovation. The youth unemployment rate in urban areas, among those aged 15 to 29 years, also spiked to nearly 19% from 17.9% in May, and 17.2% in April, according to the statistics ministry. watch now The labor market problem could persist for a few years, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of South Asia economic research at Standard Chartered, urging New Delhi to ramp up efforts in creating more salaried jobs.

Its CEO Salil Parekh told CNBC-TV 18 last week that the company hired 17,000 people in the first quarter and plans to recruit 20,000 graduates this year, while highlighting AI, cloud and cost efficiency as key growth drivers. But that might not be indicative of the broader outlook for the sector: Industry body Nasscom last month said some "workforce rationalization" is expected in the near term, driven by rising client expectations around agility, innovation, and speed, with AI and automation becoming central to business operations, according to local media reports.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours. so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said. Russia earlier Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying that India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia." "We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday.

Goldman Sachs found that the median stock whose earnings topped expectations has only outperformed the S & P 500 by 0.55 percentage points, below the historical median of 1.01 percentage points. Shares of Amazon , for example, dropped more than 9% in two days after the online retailer reported second-quarter results that topped expectations but issued lackluster current-quarter operating income guidance.

"Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a court filing jointly filed by Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required within three calendar days to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition," according to the stipulation filed Monday.

The move allows Trump to install another of his appointees to the Fed Board of Governors at a time when the White House is aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates. "Both Kevins are very good, and there are other people that are very good, too," Trump said, adding that Kugler's resignation "was a pleasant surprise." Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. He has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism, and there has been speculation that the president would name a "shadow chair" who could help undermine Powell until his term expires. Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility." Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia's actions during the 2016 election, a senior Trump administration official said.

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post. But absolutely that jobs number, if the revision turns out to be true, does suggest that there's less momentum than we thought," said Hassett, director of the National Economic Council who is thought to be a leading contender for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

"To me, today's jobs report is what entering a recession looks like," Josh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, wrote after the Friday report.

Article: Philip Fong | Afp | Getty Images Visitor interest in Japan plunged in June, amid a prophecy in a manga that predicted a "disaster" would strike Japan in July 2025. The prediction was in a 2021 reprint of a Japanese comic book, or manga, titled "Watashi ga Mita Mirai, Kanzenban" (which translates to "The Future That I Saw, Complete Edition") by artist Ryo Tatsuki. In the original printing of the book in 1999, the cover page referenced a "disaster in March 2011." In March 2011, Japan suffered its most powerful earthquake on record, the Great Tohoku Earthquake, which caused almost 20,000 deaths and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG told CNBC that the rumor was widely circulated in Hong Kong, where it spread over mainstream media, TV networks and through YouTube influencers. "This is the first time we've seen such an incident." Hong Kong and Japanese media reported earlier in July that Hong Kong airlines cut flights to some Japanese cities, including Nagoya. A January report from Japan's Asahi Shimbun, citing the country's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, also warned that the likelihood of a megaquake in the next 30 years had risen to 80%—a development that, combined with the prediction, created a "perfect storm" to deter travelers, Yuen said. However, Japan's Meteorological Agency said: "It should be noted that the issuance of information indicating elevated potential for a Nankai Trough earthquake does not necessarily mean that one will actually strike." Asian tourists more affected than Western ones JNTO data showed that the share of Asian tourists fell year on year in June, but that of Western countries rose.

Article: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images Come Friday, the world will have to contend with higher tariff rates from the Trump administration, raising the specter of even more economic uncertainty. Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done "over 200 deals" in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that "90 deals in 90 days" was possible. Vietnam: tariffs more than halved Vietnam was the second to cross the line with the Trump administration, with Trump announcing a trade agreement on July 2 that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slashed from 46% to 20%. One point with Vietnam was a 40% "transshipping" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S, although it is not clear how this will be applied. Philippines: marginal decrease Unlike its ASEAN counterparts above, which had sizable reductions to its tariff duties, the Philippines saw a decrease of a single percentage point to 19% from 20% on July 22. goods as part of the agreement, according to Trump, who praised the country for what he described as "going OPEN MARKET with the United States." In addition, Trump also said that the Philippines will work together "Militarily," without specifying any details. after China, seeing its tariff rate cut to 15% from 25% on July 23, and being the first economy to see a lower preferential tariff rate for its key automobile sector. would "receive 90% of the Profits." The path to this agreement was fraught with uncertainty, with Trump saying days before the agreement that he did not expect the two countries to reach a deal. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou went as far as saying it was an act of "submission" and a "dark day." EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, however, called it "the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances." South Korea: also at 15% South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement, on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "90% of the profits" from that $350 billion investment will be "going to the American people." However, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the $350 billion fund will play a role in facilitating the "active entry" of Korean companies into the U.S. It was initially hit with a 34% tariff from "Liberation Day," before a series of back-and-forth measures between the two sides saw the duties skyrocket to 145% duties for Chinese imports to the U.S. For countries without a deal, it appears that a higher global baseline tariff of about 15%-20% will be slapped on them, according to Trump, higher than the 10% baseline announced on "Liberation Day." Countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. India: tariffs and a penalty On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on India, with an additional unspecified "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. "While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what Trump imposed on India on "Liberation Day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner, but at the high end of the 20%-25% range that the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that the partners were in an "intense phase" of talks, noting that it would be unlikely for an agreement not to include any tariffs, Reuters reported.

Article: First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re Andy Palmer The emergence of CAT bonds as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In just the last few weeks, Greece has been battling major wildfires across the country, temperatures notched a national record of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in neighboring Turkey, destructive and deadly flooding took place in Texas and climate change triggered record-breaking heat in Iceland and Greenland. 'Astronomical growth' Alongside increasing usage of the CAT bond market by insurers and reinsurers, it is thought that the portfolio diversification benefits of these bonds has helped to drive a surge in investor interest. Reinsurance company Swiss Re said in a report published Wednesday that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down. Andy Palmer, head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, said "astronomical growth" had helped to push the size of the CAT bond market to nearly $56 billion in the first half of the year. "One of the statements that historically was made to me in the past when I talked about CAT bond market growth was 'oh yeah, but it's the same guys just doing bigger deals. In terms of the investors buying CAT bonds, Swiss Re's Palmer said dedicated ILS fund managers account for approximately 75% of the market, with he majority of that money stemming from pension funds. Insured losses German reinsurance giant Munich Re said in a report published Tuesday that insured losses from natural catastrophe events amounted to $80 billion in the first six months of 2025, marking the second-highest first-half figure since records began in 1980.

Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/heatwaves-drive-spikes-in-demand-for-air-conditioning-across-europe.html
Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

Article: LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Thursday said that Microsoft and Amazon are hurting competition in the cloud computing industry and called for a probe into their market dominance under the country's strict new tech rules. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power" and reap financial gain exceeding the cost of capital expenditure over a sustained period. Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have built huge businesses by offering access to computing resources — such as data storage and processing — via the internet using data centers, large facilities that contain dedicated hardware. The CMA is concerned that certain practices within the space, such as egress fees and unfavorable licensing terms, are creating a "lock-in" effect where businesses are getting trapped into contractual agreements that are difficult to get out of. Microsoft said the regulator's decision "misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes." "Its recommendations fail to cover Google, one of the fastest-growing cloud market participants," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. Amazon also disputed the CMA's findings and said recommendations for a fresh probe into the two tech giants' dominance of cloud were "unwarranted." "It risks making the UK a global outlier at a time when businesses need regulatory predictability for the UK to maintain international competitiveness," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. Swift action will be "essential to ensure British businesses pay a fair price and to unleash choice, innovation and economic growth in teh U.K.," Chris Lindsay, Google's vice president of customer engineering for EMEA, said in a statement.

"Revolut is already a regulated bank in over 30 countries, including some of the toughest jurisdictions in the world," he told CNBC, noting the company is worth more than some major U.K banks on a rumored $65 billion valuation . Regulators are nervous about getting it wrong due to the lingering "scar tissue" of the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fraud prevention platform Sardine AI.

However, as realization dawned that a weaker pound translates into higher earnings from overseas revenues, the index rallied and, a week later, it was some 2.6% higher than it had been before the referendum. However, the Footsie is also packed with companies that do little or no business in the U.K., such as Antofagasta , a Chilean copper miner; Fresnillo , a Mexican silver miner; Mondi , a global leader in paper and packaging with 100 production sites around the world but none in Britain; and Ashtead Group , a plant and tool hire company that derives more than 90% of its earnings from the U.S., where it trades under the name Sunbelt Rentals — the name it will take when it moves its primary stock listing early in 2026. Even a number of businesses traditionally seen as quintessentially British to the extent that they have (or have had) the word in their company moniker, such as BP , BAE Systems and British American Tobacco , derive the majority of their earnings outside the U.K. At its launch, 41 years ago, the Footsie was full of companies that made the majority, if not all, of their sales and profits in the U.K., including a clutch of domestically oriented brewing, pub and hotel operators in Scottish & Newcastle, Bass, Whitbread, Grand Metropolitan and Allied Lyons; two flat pack furniture and joinery companies in Magnet & Southerns and MFI; and a whole host of then U.K.-focused retailers, including Burton Group, House of Fraser, Sears (no relation to the U.S. Carlos Jasso | Afp | Getty Images With globalization yet to take off — this was, of course, before the fall of the Berlin Wall — even those financial services companies in the Footsie were largely domestically focused, including the insurers Commercial Union and General Accident (now both part of Aviva Group), Prudential and Sun Life and lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Midland Bank (now part of HSBC) and Barclays, which was yet to embark on its push into the wholesale and investment banking activities with which it is most closely associated these days.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men.

Article: Brazil's Supreme Court put former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday ahead of his trial for an alleged coup plot, underscoring the court's resolve despite escalating tariffs and sanctions from U.S. In an interview with Reuters last month, Bolsonaro called Moraes a "dictator" and said the restraining orders against him were acts of "cowardice." Some Bolsonaro allies have worried that Trump's tactics may be backfiring in Brazil, compounding trouble for Bolsonaro and rallying public support behind Lula's leftist government. However, Sunday demonstrations by Bolsonaro supporters — the largest in months — show that Trump's tirades and sanctions against Moraes have also fired up the far-right former army captain's political base. Bolsonaro appeared virtually at a protest in Rio de Janeiro via phone call to his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, in what some saw as the latest test of his restraining orders. sanctions against the judge, adding: "I hope the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this person (Moraes) causing so much upheaval." The judge's orders, including the restraining orders under penalty of arrest, have been upheld by the wider court. Those orders and the larger case before the Supreme Court came after two years of investigations into Bolsonaro's role in an election-denying movement that culminated in riots by his supporters that rocked Brasilia in January 2023. In contrast with the tangle of criminal cases which mostly stalled against Trump, Brazilian courts moved swiftly against Bolsonaro, threatening to end his political career and fracture his right-wing movement. In a statement after the arrest on Monday, Congressman Bolsonaro called Moraes "an out-of-control psychopath who never hesitates to double down." Trump last month shared a letter he had sent to Bolsonaro. The arrest could give Trump a pretext to pile on additional measures against Brazil, said Graziella Testa, a political science professor at the Federal University of Parana, adding that Bolsonaro seemed to be consciously provoking escalation. "I think things could escalate because this will be seen as a reaction to the Magnitsky sanction" against Moraes, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner at the Think Policy political risk consultancy in Brasilia, referring to the asset freeze imposed on Moraes last week.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S.

Article: President Donald Trump and one of his top economic advisors on Monday stoked baseless conspiracies about federal jobs data, suggesting without evidence that Friday's weaker-than-expected employment report had been "rigged" by federal workers bent on sabotaging the president. Trump, meanwhile, claimed on social media that the report, which painted a dour picture of the economy, was "RIGGED" and the previous months' revisions had been "CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!" The only way to protect the integrity of economic data, said Hassett, is to replace the economists and statisticians who lead the agencies that collect data.

Asked to provide evidence for Trump's claims of impropriety, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that revisions made to prior months were "the evidence." Trump also said the revisions were evidence of someone manipulating the data, "I assume in the hopes of getting 'Kamala' elected." "What you saw on Friday was the effect of trying to do a better job, getting more information," Beach said, referring to the revisions. Despite the old-fashioned style of surveying households through the mail and in-person interviews, the first-release estimates of jobs added or lost each month has been getting more and more accurate over time, according to Yale Budget Lab director Ernie Tedeschi.

Revisions are common in jobs report data, as the initial estimate often becomes more precise as additional payroll data becomes available in subsequent months.

Pirro, a 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin, who had never served as a prosecutor or tried a case before taking office in January. In the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro's ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.

President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy told families of hostages being held by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Saturday that he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza.

In response, Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since 2007 but has been militarily battered by Israel in the war, said it would not relinquish "armed resistance" unless an "independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital" was established. Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza war and deal for the release of half the hostages ended last week in deadlock.

Article: A federal agent with US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) exits his vehicle near MacArthur Park, as a large group of federal law enforcement agents gather in the area, in Los Angeles, California, on July 7, 2025. Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing Monday afternoon at which the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12 by Judge Maame E. She wrote the government cannot use factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion to detain someone. "If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion," the judges wrote. The Los Angeles region has been a battleground with the Trump administration over its aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and Marines for several weeks. Among the plaintiffs is Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a video taken by a friend on June 13 being seized by federal agents as he yells, "I was born here in the states, East LA bro!" They want to "send us back to a world where a U.S. can be grabbed, slammed against a fence and have his phone and ID taken from him just because he was working at a tow yard in a Latino neighborhood," American Civil Liberties Union attorney Mohammad Tajsar told the court Monday. The federal government argued that it hadn't been given enough time to collect and present evidence in the lawsuit, given that it was filed shortly before the July 4 holiday and a hearing was held the following week. Sung, a Biden appointee, said that in an area like Los Angeles, where Latinos make up as much as half the population, those factors "cannot possibly weed out those who have undocumented status and those who have documented legal status." She also asked: "What is the harm to being told not to do something that you claim you're already not doing?" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the Friday night decision a "victory for the rule of law" and said the city will protect residents from the "racial profiling and other illegal tactics" used by federal agents.

Article: A researcher at Texas A&M University flying home from abroad was detained for more than a week by immigration authorities at the San Francisco International Airport, sleeping in a chair and living off food sold in the airport, his family and attorneys said Thursday. It was unclear why Tae Heung "Will" Kim, who is a legal permanent resident with a green card, was detained July 21, his attorney Karl Krooth said at a news conference. Kim, who went to South Korea to attend his brother's wedding, is now in removal proceedings to be deported and is being held at an immigration detention facility in Arizona, Krooth said, adding that he has yet to talk to his client. But one attorney told the Washington Post, which first reported on Kim's detention, that he fulfilled a community service requirement and successfully petitioned for nondisclosure to seal the offense from the public record. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.

Medvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X that day. Trump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. On Friday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, "Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that."

Article: It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em Sydney!" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social not long after markets opened. Monday's gains come a little over a week after American Eagle first announced that the "Euphoria" star would headline its fall marketing campaign with the slogan: "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans." Initially, the stock rose in an apparent bout of meme stock mania, but over the past week, shares of the company have been down as American Eagle has faced criticism about the campaign. American Eagle has stayed largely quiet on the matter — releasing a brief statement on its Instagram account on Friday that said the slogan "is and always was about the jeans." "We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way," the company said. "Great jeans look good on everyone." The saga highlights the tightrope that marketers are walking when deciding what types of ads to run and the audiences they should be targeting when consumer attention is harder than ever to win and maintain. Bud Lite's ill-fated Dylan Mulvaney collaboration and the subsequent impact on its sales and its parent company's stock price, highlighted how things can go wrong when companies release marketing that some may consider "woke." On the other hand, American Eagle's campaign is now showing the other side of that coin – what can happen when a company releases marketing that isn't "woke" and perhaps more accepted on the cultural right. In the lead-up to American Eagle's campaign with Sweeney, the company has been struggling to grow sales, and the marketing blitz is one of the many things it's doing to reverse that negative slump. Whether or not that search interest translates to more shoppers buying jeans from American Eagle will be more clear when the retailer reports earnings, which is expected in the next few weeks. As of Friday's close, shares of American Eagle were down more than 27% so far this year as the company grapples with larger macroeconomic concerns related to tariffs, consumer spending and its own merchandising missteps. Earlier this year, the company said it would take a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise after it pulled its full-year guidance due to slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment. For its current quarter, American Eagle said in May that it expects revenue to fall 5%, comparable sales to be down 3% and gross margin to be lower compared with the prior year.

Leslie Josephs/CNBC The terminal — set to be roughly the size of the two new LaGuardia Airport terminals that opened in the past decade combined — will be dedicated solely to international travelers, which the developers said is key to the design. "From the very first pen to paper … we had the international customer in mind," Jennifer Aument, CEO of the New Terminal One, the company developing the project, said at a press conference at the airport last month. Leslie Josephs/CNBC CNBC and other media got a look at the construction progress, led by Aument, in early July as part of what the company said will likely be among the last hardhat tours of the facility before opening day. In addition to Terminal 1, the current Terminal 7, currently home to Alaska Airlines and Ireland's Aer Lingus, will be knocked down for a new Terminal 6, whose first gates are set to open next year.

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

For its first microgrid, Redwood partnered with Crusoe, best known for the massive AI data center it is building in Abilene, Texas, as part of Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project backed by OpenAI, Oracle , SoftBank and others. "In the energy industry, the holy grail has been 24/7 renewable power, but forever the cost of batteries was too high, until today," says Cully Cavness, Crusoe co-founder, COO and president. Redwood says it has over a gigawatt-hour of reusable batteries in its inventory, the equivalent of 12,500 EVs, and it's designing 100 plus megawatt projects, up to 10 times the size of the pilot microgrid with Crusoe. We're already working on engineering projects that are in that type of magnitude." In addition to its recycling business, Redwood will now be competing in a growing energy storage market with established players like Tesla , which has built a successful energy business with its Megapack grid-scale storage. "The future demand for energy storage specifically is massive, so it's not surprising that players who traditionally haven't been in this space are looking to enter," said Pete Tillotson, senior research analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Potentially with clients where cost is a little bit more of a limiter."

David Cannon | David Cannon Collection | Getty Images When Nikesh Arora was named CEO of Palo Alto Networks in June 2018, the cybersecurity company was valued at about $19 billion and was taking on large networking vendors like Cisco and Juniper, which were building security into their products. Seven years later, Palo Alto's market cap has expanded by sixfold, driven in part by an acquisition spree that's seen Arora spearhead more than 20 deals in an effort to create a one-stop shop for all things cybersecurity. Arora's ambitions took a dramatic turn last week, when Palo Alto announced by far its biggest bet to date: the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security platform CyberArk . In the company's 2024 annual report published in October, Palo Alto named Alphabet as a competitor for the first time, listing it alongside Cisco and Microsof t as companies "that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market." In 2023, Cisco paid $28 billion for Splunk, which focuses on data protection. watch now In an interview with CNBC soon after last week's announcement, Arora said CyberArk fits squarely into his company's focus on AI and, in this case, the complexities that come with granting permissions and access. "Our entire acquisition strategy, our organic product growth strategy, our selling strategy, has always been based on that approach," said Arora, 57, who's seen his personal wealth top $1 billion with the big run-up in the stock. In CyberArk's earnings report last week, the company said revenue jumped 46% in the latest quarter to $328 million, equal to about 14% of Palo Alto revenue, based on the most recent report. Arora said in the conference call announcing the deal that he intends to work with CyberArk CEO Matt Cohen and Chairman Udi Mokady to "accelerate the pace of innovation." "We look for great products, a team that can execute in the product, and we let them run it," Arora told CNBC. "This is going to be a different challenge, but we've done well 24 times, so I'm pretty confident that our team can handle this." Most of Arora's acquisitions over the years have been of smaller startups. Roughly 10 months before leaving SoftBank, Arora said he was buying more than $480 million worth of stock in the Japanese conglomerate, which he said involved taking an "enormous risk" reflecting his confidence "about the future" of the company. While that's all firmly in the past, Arora said that over the years, he's "scavenged" different leadership qualities from each of his mentors, including an appetite for risk from Son. He was a skilled and experienced businessman but some worried that he hadn't created a notable product or founded a company like many of his industry peers, said Gallo, who recommends buying Palo Alto shares. In his first few years at the company, Arora made numerous acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion, helping Palo Alto penetrate the cloud security space as more businesses were moving their workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google's cloud. "Every company wishes they were in Palo Alto shoes, where they could actually offer all these different products," said Andrew Nowinski, an analyst at Wells Fargo who has a buy recommendation on the stock. You're not going to see many vendors like Palo Alto." With its expansion into identity management, Palo Alto is going big in a space that's viewed by experts as a key spending area for IT in the coming years. "That's your growth driver." Ofer Schreiber, senior partner and head of YL Ventures' Israel office, said Palo Alto has helped take an extremely fragmented market, consisting of lots of point solutions, and created a centralized vendor for clients. Analysts at KeyBanc lowered their rating to the equivalent of hold from buy, due partly to concerns about a lack of "meaningful synergies" in the product offerings and a view that customers would prefer an "independent vendor solely focused on identity." But TD Cowen's Shaul Eyal still recommends buying the shares. He said that what's made Arora successful is his "relentless focus on execution" and his strategy of betting on sizeable markets where Palo Alto can quickly scale and become the leader or runner-up.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of."

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In response at the time, the company said it stands "by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program." In July, the Journal also reported that the DOJ interviewed several doctors about UnitedHealth's practices and whether they felt pressured to submit claims for certain conditions that bolstered payments from the Medicare Advantage program to the company.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a metric that Fed watches closely as a demand indicator, rose just 1.2%, down from the 1.9% increase in Q1 and the slowest gain since the fourth quarter of 2022.

Article: Payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 104,000 for the month, reversing a loss of 23,000 in June and topping the Dow Jones forecast from economists for an increase of 64,000. Though the pace of hiring is well off where it stood last year, the June total was the best since March and consistent with a slowing but still fairly vibrant jobs picture. "Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient." The report follows months of concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would hold back economic growth and stymie consumer spending.

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Article: "The new EU tariff of 15% means that UK exports to the US have become relatively cheaper, which could boost British trade with the US as American firms buy goods from Britain rather than the EU," he explained. consumers due to the lower tariff rate, meaning they may favor British products over those manufactured in the EU, Alex Altmann, partner and head of Lubbock Fine LLP's German desk, suggested in a note published shortly after the EU-U.S. "The UK's lower US tariffs do offer a major incentive for EU companies to shift some of their manufacturing bases to the UK or to expand their existing UK facilities," he added. Here the UK benefits from its major trading partner averting a recession which could have resulted in a decline in UK exports to the EU," he said in written comments. "If the US had proceeded with 30% tariffs against most EU goods, UK goods with a 10% tariff, which is paid by the US importer in most circumstances, could have appeared significantly more attractive," she said.

Article: UN official says Israel expanding Gaza operations would risk 'catastrophic consequences' Just now Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Yang Tian BBC News Share Save Watch: UN official says Netanyahu's reported Gaza expansion plans risk "catastrophic consequences" A top UN official has warned there would be "catastrophic consequences" if Israel expands its military operations in Gaza, after reports Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is pushing for a total reoccupation of the strip. Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenča told a meeting of the UN Security Council such a move would be "deeply alarming" if true, and could endanger the lives of more Palestinians, as well as Israeli hostages held by Hamas. It has been suggested that the plan could be a negotiating tactic to pressure Hamas after a recent breakdown of ceasefire talks or an attempt to shore up support from Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. Israel's military said it already had operational control of 75% of Gaza, but the new plan would propose occupying the entire region - including areas where more than two million Palestinians now live.

Article: Court documents seen by the BBC allege the shipments included Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become a key focus of US export controls aimed at stopping China purchasing the cutting-edge technology. The DOJ alleged that over the last three years ALX Solutions, a company it said was run by Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, exported the chips from the US to China without the required licences. Two Chinese nationals have been arrested and charged with illegally shipping millions of dollars' worth of powerful AI chips to China, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Tuesday. "Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support or updates." According to court documents, California-based ALX Solutions had three known employees: Mr Geng handled the firm's finances, Ms Yang was its secretary, while its chief executive was not named in the documents. Business records showed the company sent goods several times from the US to shipping firms in Singapore and Malaysia between October 2022 and July 2025, the DOJ said, noting that both countries are used as transit hubs to "conceal illegal shipments" to China. Last December, ALX sent a shipment with export-restricted computing chips - including Nvidia's H100 and GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs - which was checked by US customs, according to court documents. In one 2023 invoice valued at more than $28.4m, ALX allegedly declared to Super Micro Computer, a supplier of Nvidia chips, that the devices were ordered for a Singapore-based customer. But a US export control officer in Singapore could not verify that the chips arrived in the country and the company named did not exist at the listed location, the court document said. "It appears that ALX Solutions shipped the Nvidia products to different end users." Super Micro did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC but said in a statement to the Reuters news agency that it was "firmly committed to compliance with all US export control regulations." It added that it would not comment on an ongoing legal case but would cooperate with authorities in any such proceedings.

Meta made the announcement as WhatsApp rolled out new anti-scam measures to alert users to potential fraudulent activity, such as a user being added to a group chat by someone not in their contacts list. Meta said WhatsApp "proactively detected and took down accounts before scam centres were able to operationalise them." In one case, WhatsApp worked with Meta and ChatGPT-developer OpenAI to disrupt scams linked to a Cambodian criminal group that offered cash for likes on social media posts to promote a fake rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme.

Article: NFL and ESPN reach nonbinding agreement for sale of NFL Network and other media assets toggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AP Ever since the NFL announced it was looking to sell NFL Network and other media assets, ESPN had been seen as one of the favorites to make a deal. Under the terms, ESPN will acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the rights to distribute the RedZone channel to cable and satellite operators and the league will get a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Along with the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN will have a second nonbinding agreement where the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property that can be used by NFL Network and other assets that have been purchased. "When I came back to Disney and assessed essentially the future of ESPN, it became clear that ESPN had to launch a bigger and more robust and digital or direct-to-consumer product, not only for the sake of ESPN's business, but for the sports fan," Iger said. "And obviously, when you start thinking about high-quality sports content, your eyes immediately head in the direction of the NFL because there's really nothing more valuable and more popular than that." NFL Network — which has nearly 50 million subscribers — would be owned and operated by ESPN and would be included in ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. "It'll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we'll continue to balance that in a really arm's length way where we'll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners." Sponsor Message The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel). "The moves align with the NFL's longstanding ambition to reach $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027 — a target first set in 2010, when league revenue stood at approximately $8.5 billion," O'Connor said. Intentionally ceding equity to the NFL transforms ESPN from a media licensee into a true platform partner — with few properties rivaling the league in terms of cultural significance, appointment viewing, audience reach, and monetization efficiency." No major changes yet Viewers will likely not see any immediate impacts until next year once everything is approved.

Article: pulls $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine contracts toggle caption Mark Schiefelbein/AP WASHINGTON — The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. Sponsor Message The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. "To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. "I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business," said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said "other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a "shift in vaccine development priorities," the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start "investing in better solutions." "Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

"After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC.

On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." During its last meeting, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that given the 50-basis-point cut, there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth, and as such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."

Article: toggle caption Fernando Llano/AP HERMOSILLO, Mexico — The United States' suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to "our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain." It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as "meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. An uncertain future With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn't figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, "but the damage is already done."

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Article: and others planned marches in the 1960s calling for Black voting rights has been reconstructed in its entirety at a museum near Detroit The Jackson Home, where Martin Luther King Jr. and others planned marches to call for Black voting rights in the early 60s in Selma, Ala., is shown being reconstructed at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Mich., Monday, July 14, 2025. The intricate operation to move and preserve the Jackson Home and other artifacts from the Civil Rights era preceded President Donald Trump's efforts to eradicate what he calls “divisive” and “race-centered ideologies,” and minimize the cultural and historical impact of race, racism and Black Americans. It was within the walls of the 3,000-square-foot (280-square-meter) bungalow that King and others strategized a series of peaceful marches from Selma to the state capital, Montgomery, that helped usher in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Jawana Jackson told AP in 2023 that she decided to ask the Henry Ford — a history museum complex in Dearborn, Michigan — to relocate and preserve her parents' house and its contents because she believes “ the house belonged to the world.” The building was taken apart and carried the more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to be reconstructed in Greenfield Village at the Henry Ford, and archivists are digitizing and cataloguing some 6,000 items contained within. “The fact that the Jackson family saved things for this long, even though they may have been out of date or old, they knew the significance of all the things that were in that home, and they saved them and preserved them,” Mooradian said. has withdrawn from the United Nation’s cultural agency because, according to the White House, UNESCO “supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November.” Trump also fired the Kennedy Center board and slashed funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. And the president issued an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," that condemns the Smithsonian Institution — a vast complex of museums, galleries and a zoo — for what he calls its “widespread effort to rewrite history.” The Smithsonian includes the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” Trump wrote. "And it’s important that we tell the truth, that people look to us for the truth, not for opinion, not for judgements but for the truth.” Just weeks after Trump's March executive order, the Rev. Amos Brown, paster emeritus of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church who was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement, said he was notified that two family bibles and a book on Black history that he loaned to the African American history museum in 2016 would be removed from the collection. The Smithsonian said in a June statement that it “routinely returns artifacts per applicable loan agreements and rotates objects on display in accordance with the Smithsonian’s high standards of care and preservation and as part of our regular museum turnover.” The Smithsonian and the African American museum have not responded to AP interview requests. The National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Museum of American History are holders of some of the most iconic artifacts from the Civil Rights era, including the lunch counter and stool from a Greensboro, North Carolina, diner where a group of Black college students conducted a sit-in to protest segregation. The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson has on loan a door from a grocery store where witnesses said 14-year-old Emmett Till of Chicago whistled at a white woman in 1955.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) Tudor Lakatos, who goes by the stage name Elvis Rromano, strikes a pose while getting ready for his performance with the Taraful Frunzelor band at the Terasa Florilor restaurant, in Bucharest, Romania, Friday, June 20, 2025. Decked out in a rhinestone shirt and oversized sunglasses, with his black hair slicked back into a 1950s-style quiff, Lakatos swivels his hips and belts out his own idiosyncratic versions of hits like “Blue Suede Shoes” at venues throughout Romania. Lakatos prefers to say that he “channels” the King of rock ‘n’ roll’s global appeal to break down stereotypes about the Roma and provide a positive role model for Roma children. “I only wanted one thing — to make friends with Romanians, to stop being called a Gypsy,″ he added, using an often derided term for people belonging to the Roma ethnic group. The Roma, an ethnic group that traces its roots to South Asia, have been persecuted across eastern Europe for centuries and are still associated with high rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. They account for about 7% of the population of Romania, where a fifth say they have faced discrimination in the past year, according to a recent survey by the European Union. At a time when anti-Roma discrimination was mainstream, Lakatos found that singing Elvis songs was a way to connect with ethnic Romanian students while rock music was a symbol of rebellion against the oppressive government. A school teacher for the past 25 years, Lakatos uses his music to show his students that they can aspire to something more than the dirt roads and horse driven carts of their village in northwestern Romania. I have said many times, ‘Call us what you want, dinosaur and brontosaurus, but at least join hands with us to educate the next generation.'” But Lakatos still crisscrosses the country to perform at venues large and small. On a hot summer evening, that journey took Lakatos to Terasa Florilor in Bucharest, a neighborhood joint whose owner takes pride in offering live music by local artists who perform on a stage made of wooden beams painted in vivid colors. In his version, the lyric Elvis made famous becomes simply “don’t step on my bare feet.” It’s a message that Elvis — born in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, during the Great Depression — probably would have understood.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power." — Holly Ellyatt In the markets U.K.

Article: 'Facial recognition tech mistook me for wanted man' 2 hours ago Share Save Sonja Jessup BBC London Home Affairs Correspondent Share Save BBC Shaun Thompson is challenging the Met Police's use of live facial recognition technology after he was wrongly identified as a suspect A man who is bringing a High Court challenge against the Metropolitan Police after live facial recognition technology wrongly identified him as a suspect has described it as "stop and search on steroids". Last month, the Met said it had made more than 1,000 arrests since January 2024 using the technology, including alleged paedophiles, rapists and violent robbers, of which 773 had led to a charge or a caution. The Met plans to double its use of LFR across London because it says it is helping catch dangerous criminals But Mr Thompson said his experience of being stopped had been "intimidating" and "aggressive". Every single time." He described how he had been returning home from a shift in Croydon, south London, with the community group Street Fathers, which aims to protect young people from knife crime. "When I asked what I was wanted for, they said, 'that's what we're here to find out'." He said officers asked him for his fingerprints, but he refused, and he was let go only after about 30 minutes, after showing them a photo of his passport. "I can only imagine the kind of damage it could do to other people if it's making mistakes with me, someone who's doing work with the community." 'Intrusive' or 'making London safer'? Big Brother Watch, whose director Silkie Carlo is bringing the legal challenge alongside Mr Thompson, said it was the first time that a misidentification case had come before the High Court. "Shaun's legal challenge is such an important opportunity for the government and the police to take stock of how this technology is spreading across London in a really unaccountable fashion." Big Brother Watch's Madeleine Stone says the legal challenge is a chance to "take stock" of how the "intrusive technology" is being used A Met Police spokesperson said that the force was unable to provide a full comment on Mr Thompson's case due to ongoing proceedings, but that it was confident its use of LFR was lawful. "We continue to engage with our communities to build understanding about how this technology works, providing reassurances that there are rigorous checks and balances in place to protect people's rights and privacy." In July, the Home Office said it would be setting out its plans for the future use of LFR in the coming months, including a legal framework and safeguards. The Met is planning to double its use of LFR to up to 10 times a week across five days, up from the current four times a week across two days. This helps us round them up." He pointed to a case where a registered sex offender, who'd been banned from being alone with young children, was picked up on LFR cameras in Denmark Hill, south-east London, in January with a six-year-old girl. We've worked really hard on this." The Met has said it works within existing human rights and data protection laws and its approach has been tested by the National Physical Laboratory, to check there is no gender or racial bias. Unless you're wanted, in which case, we arrest you." Registered sex offender David Cheneler was jailed for two years after LFR cameras spotted him with a six-year-old girl The Met has also announced plans to use LFR on the approach to and from this year's Notting Hill Carnival over the August Bank Holiday, although not within the boundaries of the event. It says the move will protect Carnival against a "tiny minority of individuals intent on causing serious harm to others" and the watchlist will include wanted suspects, as well as missing people "who may be at risk of criminal or sexual exploitation". 'An algorithm and a camera' "The Met Police has ramped up LFR in an extraordinary fashion over the last couple of years, in a way that raises questions around racial discrimination and the communities they're targeting", said Madeline Stone. However, it says it having to make savings due to "real term funding cuts" and expecting to lose around 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff by the end of the year. Mr Thompson told me he was concerned about the deployment of LFR in communities where there were already low levels of trust in policing and contrasted this approach with the work being done by Street Fathers. "We speak to the kids, we make time for the children, we put ourselves in hotspots." He said parents regularly called the group asking them to remove weapons they had discovered in their children's bedrooms.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns year as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

On Wednesday, Trump vowed to "substantially" raise tariffs on Indian exports, following a 25% hike and threats of penalties over Russian oil and arms purchases. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating."

Article: It's 2025, the year we decided we need a widespread slur for robots toggle caption Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe Debate over the song of the summer rages on, but if there were a contest for a word of the summer, one front runner would surely be the onomatopoeiac, clanker. One popular video from July shows a delivery robot on wheels – the kind that looks like a mobile cooler with flashing lights that look like eyes – stopped on a patch of grass on the side of a road. Clanker!" Sponsor Message Even with little background, it's clear from context clues that clanker is not a good thing, but in this installment of Word of the Week we will answer – what exactly does it mean? Adam Aleksic, a linguist, author and content creator best known across social media as the @etomologynerd , told NPR it's a derogatory term for robots that stems from the Star Wars universe dating back to 2005. … And then we adopted it because it sounds useful." While other sci-fi franchises and fandoms have created their own lexicon that included robot slurs — Battlestar Galactica and Blade Runner both used skin-job as a pejorative for human-appearing robots — Aleksic said, those terms didn't really catch on because they didn't make as much sense. He noted that clanker has already had a long life on Star Wars' subreddits, specifically subreddits about the Battlefront video game, and as a meme, where people use it to belittle robots. toggle caption Patrick Kovarik/AFP via Getty Images "I remember tweets from January of this year where people were saying, 'Oh, we need a slur for AI' And finally, it seems like that cultural need is being met," he said. So ironically, the people saying clanker, are assigning more of a personality to these robots than actually exists." Many of the memes circulating now zero in on the xenophobia of it all, and what social media users are calling, robot racism or robophobia. Using existing stereotypes and tropes, they joke about a not too distant future where robots are ubiquitous as second-class citizens, facing discrimination in the same ways that Black people and other racial or ethnic groups in America have historically faced. In one video with over 7.7 million views , TikTok user @vibestealer, who is a young Black man, pretends it's 2044 and his daughter has brought home a robot boyfriend. Another popular iteration of the meme features people pretending to apologize to their future robot overlords for past anti-robot transgressions, including use of the "c-word." The robots are coming for us all toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images North America The spread of clankers comes as AI is fundamentally transforming work and the workplace as we know them. Sponsor Message "We have a social need right now to respond to the proliferation of AI, especially when AI is taking human jobs, especially when they're replacing online creators," Aleksic said. "To be clear on a longer time horizon, and by longer we're talking about 15 to 20 years, not 50 or a hundred years, there will be virtually nothing that a human being can do that a machine can't do as well or better for a tiny fraction of the cost," Adam Dorr, the director of Research for Rethinx, a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank that focuses on understanding disruptive technology, told NPR. "That's simply where the technology of artificial intelligence and robotics and automation is headed." For now, he said, we are living in a grace period, where AI will enhance the work that we do.

Article: "And he also started to talk about very violent, gory things." It wasn't until Elliott was hospitalized, in early 2024, that Dana formed a more complete picture of how strangers online had brought him to the point of extensive self-harm and repetitive thoughts of suicide. And it was finally then that Dana learned about some of these networks, such as 764 and CVLT (pronounced "cult"), which have been linked to random violent attacks, arson, child sexual abuse material, child sexploitation, bomb threats, plots to murder and at least two deaths in the U.S. Now, more than a year after Elliott was hospitalized, Dana finally feels ready to share the story of what her family went through, in the hope that it may help other parents understand some of the dangers that children may encounter online. "But it seemed like somehow he kept finding other items to harm himself." Sometimes, Dana said, he would come to her for help after cutting himself, saying he felt like he was out of control. He parroted the ideology of accelerationist extremists, who frame Western civilization as decadent and corrupt and who promote the idea that total societal collapse is necessary to establish a new fascist order. He's always been very clear about having meaning and purpose." Sponsor Message Nihilistic violent extremism In March, the FBI issued a public service announcement warning of "violent online networks," such as 764 and CVLT, that target minors and other vulnerable individuals. The FBI has recently focused on a relatively new motive within this area, for which it has coined the term "nihilistic violent extremism." "The term Nihilistic Violent Extremism (NVE) refers to what is motivating some of these subjects to commit criminal acts," the FBI wrote in a statement to NPR. Reporting from The Washington Post has found instances where predators within these networks sought to boost their influence by encouraging victims to livestream their suicides, and by then sharing those videos. Sponsor Message "There is a massive mixture of harms that are occurring in this ecosystem," said Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism and the Accelerationism Research Consortium. "There are individuals who are collaborating with one another across transnational lines, using any and every ideological framework they can to push people into harming others [and] harming themselves." Kriner has testified as an expert witness in federal cases against people accused of involvement with these networks. And then they use those videos to further exploit them." Perhaps most concerning, say researchers of online extremism, is that minors targeted in these spaces are often encouraged to victimize other children. "He was very angry that he had been called out, [saying] that we were all being ridiculous and making too big of a deal of nothing." But at the hospital, it quickly became apparent that Elliott's condition had gotten very serious. They encourage their victims to carve certain symbols to call out certain members." Dana said medical staff assessed that Elliott was at moderate/high risk of suicide, but because he didn't intimate a plan for suicide, the staff wanted to send him home after treating his wounds. And she said right away, I suspect that your son is being extorted or has been contacted by a group called 764." Sponsor Message The officer told Dana that the FBI would be getting involved to determine whether Elliott had been contacted directly by anyone in the network. And he was fully naked." Sponsor Message Dana said she and law enforcement representatives found evidence that there had very recently been some direct messaging with someone whom they could not identify. The FBI told Dana that Elliott needed inpatient care for 30 to 60 days, primarily to "detox" from the harmful networks in which he had immersed himself for many months. toggle caption Joanna Kulesza for NPR "This is hard to say about your own kid, but he was the target of a good bit of bullying at school, oftentimes with a social media component," she said.

Article: And I tried to talk to the council and the mayor to work something out, and it didn't," says Wilson, a now-retired school bus driver, who led a group of other Black voters to sue St. Sponsor Message Their lawsuit was among the hundreds of cases that private individuals and groups have brought to enforce protections against racial discrimination under the federal Voting Rights Act, which then-President Lyndon B. "It wouldn't have happened" without the pressure of his lawsuit, says Wilson, a onetime candidate for alderperson who was later elected as a Democratic member of his Louisiana parish's police jury, a local governing board. "If you didn't go further, it just wouldn't happen." The legal path that allowed Wilson to fight against the dilution of his and other Black voters' collective power at the ballot box, however, may be ending soon, as a novel legal argument makes its way to the U.S. Contrary to decades of precedent, Republican state officials in at least 15 states contend that private individuals and groups do not have the right to sue to enforce Section 2 because they are not explicitly named in the landmark law's text. The justices may also be preparing to take up a broader question about the constitutionality of Section 2 protections, based on an order last week for legal briefs in a Louisiana congressional redistricting case originally filed by Black voters. At a time when the Justice Department under the Trump administration has backed off from voting rights lawsuits the department had brought when former President Joe Biden was in office, the prospect of voters of color no longer being allowed to bring their own cases has supporters of the Voting Rights Act concerned about the law's survival. "It's just going to be disastrous because if we can't do that, well, we just have no chance of fairness." An estimated 92% of Section 2 lawsuits have been brought by private individuals and groups since 1965 While the Voting Rights Act is widely considered one of the most effective civil rights laws in U.S. Still, estimates back up what has long been known in the legal world: Private individuals and groups, not the Justice Department, have brought the overwhelming majority of Section 2 cases. "Private plaintiffs have been party to 96.4% of Section 2 claims that produced published opinions since 1982, and the sole litigants in 86.7% of these decisions," writes Ellen Katz in a 2024 Michigan Law Review Online article summing up estimates by the Voting Rights Initiative at the University of Michigan Law School, which focused on cases filed after Congress last amended Section 2. Separately, going back to 1965, Morgan Kousser, a professor emeritus at the California Institute of Technology and historian of the Voting Rights Act, has tallied more than 1,800 Section 2 lawsuits, including those that ended with settlements. "Certainly counting the settlements as well and looking at how many of them are the result of private lawsuits makes clearer what the stakes are in destroying the private right of action." Sponsor Message How a Supreme Court ruling against a private right of action under Section 2 can have a "domino effect" So far, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings apply to seven mainly Midwestern states, is the country's only federal appeals circuit that has found no private right of action under Section 2. While the Supreme Court has, for now, paused an 8th Circuit panel's ruling in the North Dakota redistricting case, some conservative justices have expressed openness to ending a private right of action for Section 2. Franita Tolson, an election law expert and dean of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, sees that as "basically subjecting the protections of the act to political whim." "This case is a cloud over this anniversary because essentially what it means is that it depends on who wins the election in order to make sure voters are protected," Tolson says. "And that is certainly not what Congress intended in passing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 or subsequently amending it so many times." In a report released before the law was amended with bipartisan support in 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee echoed a similar House committee report by underscoring "the existence of the private right of action under Section 2, as has been clearly intended by Congress since 1965." The 8th Circuit panel for the North Dakota case maintained, however, that because this kind of explicit language did not end up in the text of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 "does not unambiguously confer an individual right" that private individuals and groups can enforce by suing. It all may be setting up what Tolson fears will be a "domino effect" on the sections of the law that survived the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Given Shelby County and what this decision could potentially do, there won't be much left for the Voting Rights Act — words on a page." Last week, a separate 8th Circuit panel ruled that private individuals and groups in its circuit's seven states also have no right to sue to enforce the law's Section 208 protections for voters with a disability or limited language proficiency. This year, Democrats in both the House and Senate have reintroduced the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in part to ensure that an "aggrieved person" has the right to bring a lawsuit under the law. Native American voters in North Dakota and Black voters in Alabama are waiting for clarity from the courts toggle caption Jack Dura/AP Amid the court rulings and legal discussions, Jamie Azure, chair of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, is trying to stay focused on what drove his tribal nation to partner with the Spirit Lake Tribe to sue North Dakota's secretary of state. Now having to appeal to the Supreme Court to ensure their right to bring this lawsuit in the first place, Azure says he remains undeterred and mindful of how the Civil Rights Movement helped pave this legal path for tribal nations today to fight for their voting rights. As the lead plaintiff in a Section 2 congressional redistricting lawsuit that Black voters brought against Alabama, Milligan's name has become shorthand for the 2023 Supreme Court decision in which a majority of justices, in an unexpected move, upheld the court's past rulings on Section 2 and sided against the southern state. "We look at the numbers of Section 2 voting rights lawsuits, and if I'm on the football team that's opposing that and I say, 'Wow, this play here is killing us,' well, then, of course, I would attack the play," explains Milligan, now a senior fellow with the Western States Center, a civil rights organization that advocates for inclusive democracy. But the problem facing Republican state officials arguing against a private right of action under Section 2, Milligan notes, is that they're "asking federal judges to discount and ignore congressional legislation and years of legal decisions that these same courts have made." Spokespeople for the offices of the Alabama and North Dakota state attorneys general did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. With so many fronts in the battle over the Voting Rights Act, Azure of the Turtle Mountain tribe says he hopes that their lawsuit at least sends a message to his nation — that their vote matters. Sponsor Message "Sometimes that's hard to tell people because we've had so many generations of distrust with the federal government, with the state government, now even with the tribal governments. "And I really hope that at the end of the day, that message also gets put out to everybody — the people elected into power should not be able to rig the systems to exclude certain types of voters from having an impact."

Article: Voice of America director says Trump officials are illegally ousting him toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images The conflict over Voice of America's future is coming to a head as a federal judge demands answers from Kari Lake, who is overseeing its federal parent for the Trump White House. The judge overseeing the Abramowitz suit and related cases has written that he is worried that Lake and the agency are failing to comply with his earlier order to ensure the Voice of America is fulfilling its congressionally mandated role to provide reliable news to all corners of the world. Lamberth wrote in an order on July 30 that Lake and the government had failed to tell him of planned mass reductions in force or the "monumental personnel decision" of removing Abramowitz as director and reassigning him to North Carolina from its Washington, D.C. Lamberth noted Lake's statement on the right-wing investigative site called "Just the News": "I'm working to eliminate the agency, and it's been a big job, but we're working hard at it." Lake told NPR later that day that the judge was "another example of a federal judiciary that is activist and out of control." Sponsor Message On Aug. Agency for Global Media, informed Abramowitz that he would be dismissed for refusing to accept the proposed reassignment, which was to become the chief administrative officer at a shortwave radio facility in Greenville, N.C. This idea that he should be sent to an engineering facility for helping shortwave radio around the world doesn't make any sense at all." "What it's really about — obviously everybody understands this — is trying to get rid of Mike Abramowitz as part of the process of trying to get rid of Voice of America." The North Carolina facility has just three full-time employees, according to Kate Neeper, Voice of America's chief strategy officer. A federal judge found illegal and unconstitutional acts; an inspector general found "waste or gross waste" by Trump-appointed CEO Michael Pack; and investigators for the Office of Special Counsel found abuses of power and violations of legal protections of the editorial independence of the Voice of America's newsroom. Sponsor Message Congress passed a law in early January 2021 requiring that a majority of a bipartisan advisory board vote for the removal of the head of Voice of America or its sister networks. Given the 2021 law, it is not clear whether Lake has the statutory power to dismiss Abramowitz without the explicit backing of that panel, which does not currently have any members. international broadcasting's importance to our national security," a joint statement sent to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in late June by all but one of the panel's dismissed members stated. "We urge Congress to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and prevent the wanton destruction of these important institutions that have advanced American interests for so long." The Justice Department legal team, led by Assistant Attorney General Brett A. A two-time unsuccessful MAGA candidate for statewide office in Arizona, Lake has emerged as one of Trump's most outspoken advocates, assailing Voice of America and other federally funded international broadcasters on Fox News, Newsmax and other right-wing sites. Lake described herself in a note sent in early March to staff as "the senior advisor for the administration." In May, as she announced that she had struck a deal with the far-right network OAN to get rights to use its content and coverage on Voice of America without cost, Lake called herself the senior advisor to the agency's chief operating officer. Later that month, Lake filed a declaration with the court listing her title as "senior advisor to the acting CEO." The acting CEO, a veteran Voice of America and agency staffer named Victor Morales, had been ousted by late July. 1 memo to Abramowitz spelling out that the agency is moving to fire him refers to Lake as "Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM." It is not clear by what process she was appointed to that role. In his July 30 order, Lamberth gave Lake and the government until next Wednesday evening to file a full explanation of what she's doing at the agency — and what's in store for the Voice of America.

Article: A federal judge on Wednesday is set to hold an evidentiary hearing over whether to block operations at the controversial facility because construction of the site allegedly bypassed federally required environmental impact studies. The hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are expected to testify -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a "one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda." Immigrant advocates have alleged that detainees have endured inhumane conditions, including flooded facilities, spoiled food, and sweltering heat -- and that they have limited access to their attorneys and are effectively housed in a jurisdictional "black hole." In a separate case challenging the legality of the facility, a federal judge ordered federal and state officials by Thursday to provide documentation showing which government or contractor is authorized to detain people at the sprawling complex. While Wednesday's hearing is limited to environmental issues -- including impacts on the nearby Big Cypress National Preserve -- the testimony is expected to shine a light on the operations of the facility and could result in a federal judge ordering the facility to be shut down until the required environmental impact studies are conducted. Rebecca Blackwell/AP On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced a similar partnership -- this time between the federal government and the state of Indiana -- to construct a migrant detention facility dubbed the "Speedway Slammer." Located 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, "Alligator Alcatraz" was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees. The site was initially conceived in the late 1960s as part of an ill-fated plan to build the "Everglades Jetport." As President Richard Nixon ushered in an era of new environmental protections -- including the law now being used to challenge Alligator Alcatraz -- the plan to build the site was scuttled, and the remaining tarmac was later used as an aviation training site. "Now, history is repeating itself as [plaintiffs] once again must act to prevent destructive development in the heart of the Everglades ecosystem in the same location," the current lawsuit says. The facility sits next to the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Big Cypress Area, ecologically sensitive and protected areas that house threatened species including the Everglade snail kite, Florida panther, wood stork, and Florida bonneted bat. "The hasty transformation of the Site into a mass detention facility, which includes the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts," the lawsuit said. The environmental groups and the tribe that brought the case allege that the sprawling facility was built without the federal or state government conducting an environmental impact statement, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) so the public and lawmakers can understand the impact of a project. Florida Department of Emergency Management executive director Kevin Guthrie, a named defendant in the lawsuit, has argued the facility is run by the state, which is not subject to NEPA regulations. The Department of Justice has also argued that the environmental groups cannot prove irreparable harm and that NEPA does not give a court the power to block the use of the facility.

JPMorgan: Overweight, $138 JPMorgan recently increased its price forecast to $138 per share from $130. For the quarter, we raise our segment operating income 1% to $4.56b on the shift of some Linear Networks expenses in F4Q; for the year, our [segment operating income] reduces marginally to $17.8b (+14%) on lower [content sales and licensing] contribution. Our EPS is now $1.46 for F3Q and $5.80 for F25 … From a financial perspective, we're comfortable with our F25 EPS at $0.05 above guidance, and see room for a modest increase to the outlook driven by multiple segments."

Article: The wife of South Korea’s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol has appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol, arrives at the special prosecutor's office in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- The wife of South Korea’s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor Wednesday, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations. The investigation into Kim Keon Hee is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The team of investigators led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said Kim was questioned for about seven hours until Wednesday afternoon, but they didn’t specify whether she will be summoned again. Yoon and Kim have faced suspicions of exerting undue influence over the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate for a 2022 parliamentary by-election, allegedly at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee’s Democratic Party claims Yoon’s government tried to cover up. Yoon had been released from prison in March after the Seoul Central District Court overturned his January arrest, but the same court approved his new arrest in July, accepting a special prosecutor’s claim that he poses a risk of destroying evidence.

Article: Since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, they have imposed severe restrictions on women and banned education beyond primary school Murtaza Jafari, 25, an Afghan migrant, types code while teaching coding remotely to women currently living in Afghanistan, in Athens, Greece, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, and quickly set about implementing a dizzying array of restrictions for women: No visiting parks or gyms, no eating in restaurants, no working, except in very few professions. The new skills “helped me regain my confidence and clarity in my direction,” said the 24-year-old, who asked to be identified by her first name only for safety reasons due to the education ban. “I am so happy to be part of this journey.” The courses are part of Afghan Geeks, a company created by Murtaza Jafari, now 25, who arrived in Greece on a boat from Turkey years ago as a teenage refugee. Jafari said he started providing online courses last December to help women in his homeland, and as an expression of gratitude for the help he received as a youngster alone in a foreign country. “The main goal was to give back to the community, especially to the Afghan women, what I had received from the other people for free,” he said, sitting in his sparse one-room flat in downtown Athens. “And if I share it, it just goes and expands, and then there’s more people to learn things.” Jafari now has 28 female students in Afghanistan in three classes: beginner, intermediate and advanced. I don’t want to do it, because I respect their culture, their choice.” With the Taliban government’s restrictions increasingly confining women to their homes, and going as far as officially banning women’s voices and bare faces in public, the web has opened a new world of possibilities for women in Afghanistan. A year and a half ago, Zuhal, a young Afghan woman whose dream of going to university was shattered, partnered with a university professor to launch an online academy for women. “Our only aim or goal is to provide free education for girls and to enhance research in Afghanistan.” The academy, Vision Online University, now runs courses in a range of subjects, from psychology and foreign languages to Quranic studies, nursing and public speaking, among others.

Article: Guests rejected by Airbnb host because they're from Wales 36 minutes ago Share Save Danielle Herbert BBC News Share Save Jemma Louise Gough Jemma Louise Gough had requested to stay at the Airbnb in Manchester ahead of her visit for a gig Two women were left "gobsmacked" after an Airbnb host rejected a request from them because they are from Wales. Jemma Louise Gough, 38, and Jamie Lee Watkins, 37, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, booked a stay in Manchester ahead of watching Australian DJ Sonny Fodera at the Co-op Live Arena in November. In their booking the friends told the Airbnb host they were coming from Wales for the gig, before seeing their payment had been refunded and their booking request had been declined. When they asked the host why, she replied: "Because you're from Wales." Airbnb said the host, who did not respond further to the pair, had been suspended while it investigated, adding discrimination "has no place on Airbnb". The pair said they were even more baffled as the message was from a verified Airbnb "superhost", which requires maintaining a 4.8 or higher overall rating and a 90% or higher response rate. "I don't know what the entire country has done to her but we're so confused, we've had no answers."

Article: More controversially, in New York City and Rhode Island, nonprofits have run government-sanctioned “overdose prevention” centers, where people can use illicit drugs under the supervision of staffers trained to revive them if they collapse. But elements of the strategy known as harm reduction are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who in July barred certain federal grants from funding programs he said enable illegal drug use. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration — while blessing the use of federal funds for distribution of naloxone and fentanyl test strips — in a letter published July 29 said the “ideological concept of harm reduction” had been used to advocate for policies that are “incompatible” with the administration’s priorities. In Kentucky, a red state that has been among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis, staff members at Kentucky Harm Reduction Coalition fear the Trump administration’s rhetoric may lead local leaders to strip funding in the coming year. Advertisement Officials at SAHMSA were asked to review online documents and webpages that mention harm reduction for removal or editing, according to an email reviewed by The Washington Post and an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal Health and Human Services matters. Asked about the webpage removals, an HHS spokesperson said the administration believes “federal funding provided by the American taxpayer goes to effective, common-sense solutions that keep people out of cyclical crisis and move them into a life of recovery.” The executive order was aimed primarily at ending “endemic vagrancy” and disorderly drug-fueled crime that the administration asserts has made U.S. Advertisement To do so, the order pushes HHS to prohibit “discretionary” grants for harm reduction efforts “that only facilitate illegal drug use.” The order also vowed to end federal funding for programs that “fail to achieve adequate outcomes,” but does not define the standard. “If our leaders are serious about reducing overdoses and building safer communities, they must invest in what works: stable housing, overdose prevention centers, syringe service programs, and accessible treatment,” said Maritza Perez Medina, director of federal affairs at Drug Policy Alliance, a left-leaning group that advocates for harm reduction. “It’s alarming that cities using proven, lifesaving interventions could be punished for doing exactly what public health demands.” A long history Harm reduction programs grew as hundreds of thousands in the United States died of overdoses, peaking in 2022 at about 110,000 dead. Research funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in March concluded that between 2013 and 2020, states with more robust harm reduction policies, as scored by experts, were associated with reduced overdose risk. In a May budget document, the Trump administration said SAMHSA grants under Biden had been used to fund “dangerous” harm reduction activities, including money for syringe exchanges and supplies for “safe smoking,” which some public health advocates assert may be less lethal than injecting. In last week’s letter, SAHMSA said its funds can no longer be used to “support poorly defined so-called ‘harm reduction,’” activities, including for purchase of drug paraphernalia or “any other supplies to promote or facilitate drug use.” It stressed the administration’s “common-sense” approach focusing on prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. Advertisement Some government leaders and policy experts push back on the influence of progressive harm reduction organizations for messaging that destigmatizes illicit substance use, and has included controversial pushes for decriminalization of certain drug crimes. Those groups have twisted the public’s conception of harm reduction, giving the Trump administration ammo to bash the strategy even while publicly supporting naloxone and fentanyl test strip distribution, said Keith Humphreys, a former White House drug policy adviser during the Obama administration. But by law, federal dollars cannot be used to buy syringes, smoking supplies or directly fund overdose prevention centers anyway, said Rahul Gupta, former director of Biden’s White House Office of National Drug Control and Policy. The Justice Department argued it violated a decades-old law banning venues that operate “for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.” The legal fight continues; in July, an appeals court ruled the nonprofit can sue the government on allegations of violating religious freedom. Philadelphia Councilmember Quetcy Lozada (D), whose district includes the drug-ravaged Kensington neighborhood, slams mobile harm reduction groups for drawing crowds of users who shoot up outside residents’ homes and trash streets. Researchers in 2023 found that neighborhoods around the New York overdose preventions centers did not experience a significant increase in calls for police or emergency services, despite concerns from community members about crime spurred by the facilities.

Nearly a year into the run, hoping to edge scalpers out and keep more of the profits, “Hamilton” jacked its top ticket price way up, from $475 to a record-setting $849, which seemed to be the sweet spot for scalpers.

Article: speaks during a press conference held by Texas Democratic lawmakers after leaving the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw Texas' 38 congressional districts, in Aurora, Ill., Aug. But this is not the first time lawmakers have fled the Texas State Capitol avoid voting on a measure they disagreed with, “breaking quorum” by depriving the statehouse of enough legislators to conduct business. Greg Abbott speaks during a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump, first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. After Abbot called a special session, 57 Democrats fled to Washington, D.C., prompting Republicans to enact a “call of the House," a procedure which mandates legislators’ attendance at the statehouse and allows the sergeant-at-arms to arrest members within Texas and bring them there. When one state representative, Philip Cortez, briefly returned to Austin in late July before rejoining the other quorum-breakers out of state, then-House Speaker Dade Phelan signed a civil warrant for his arrest. While a state district judge issued a temporary restraining order to prevent Abbott and Phelan from arresting the Democrats, the Texas Supreme Court quickly temporarily blocked that order, allowing Phelan to sign warrants for the 52 remaining absent Democrats. Lawmakers began to trickle back to the state capital, citing various personal and legislative concerns, such as the looming redistricting process that required maps to be approved before November that year. James Talarico posted on X at the time that he had come back to "clean up Greg Abbott’s latest messes from COVID to ERCOT [the Electric Reliability Council of Texas].” Some Democrats who remained in Washington were displeased. Jasmine Crockett, then a state representative, accused the legislators who returned of “trying to please the Governor and His OPPRESSIVE Agenda.” Beyond the financial cost, lawmakers faced few consequences once they returned to the state, besides then-speaker Phelan stripping state Rep. The Texas Tribune reported that Democrats spent around $10,000 a day on lodging and food during the walkout, paid by the House Democratic Caucus, additional fundraising around the quorum break, and out of lawmakers’ pockets. University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus told ABC News the FAA tracked planes that were suspected of taking Democrats out of the state, and no formal punishments were levied once they returned. Eric Gay/AP The New York Times reported at the time that then-Republican House Speaker Tom Craddick asked Texas Rangers to find and bring back the missing Democrats, but they did not have the authority to do so since the legislators were in Oklahoma. The first instance of quorum-breaking in Texas took place in 1870, when 13 legislators withdrew from the Senate but remained in the state, according to the Texas State Historical Association.

Read more CNBC Transcript: President of the United States Donald Trump Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Trump’s tariff playbook comes with a baseball twist Trump strikes EU trade deal with 15% tariffs Emre Peker, director for Europe at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said neither the EU's $600 billion investment pledge nor the $750 billion energy promise were realistic targets, "especially not in the way Trump characterized them on Squawk Box — that is, as a gift that he will use to invest in whatever he wants." "The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff. This tactic worked during Trump's first term, with the EU demonstrating soaring LNG and soybean imports from the US." Underlining problems with the feasibility of the EU's energy pledge, Peker said even if the bloc bought all U.S. 'A negotiating tactic' "I think it is a negotiating tactic, but I would have expected the EU to come up with the first round to be more realistic and more favorable to the EU," Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, lead energy analyst for the Europe team at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told CNBC by video call. She pointed out that for the EU to meet its annual commitment of $250 billion of energy products over the next three years, the EU would need to source about 70% of its energy imports from the country, a prospect that raises supply security concerns. "Energy trade has always been a key item in the EU-US trade dialogue in the last years, but market dynamics rather than political declarations have been the determining factor here," Tagliapietra said.

For example, only 71% of families submitted the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which serves as the gateway to all federal aid money, including loans, work study and grants. watch now And although most advisors say 529 college savings plans are a "no-brainer" when it comes to financial planning for college — largely because of the tax advantages — fewer than one-third of families utilize them, according to Sallie Mae. Recent data from Credit Karma paints an even starker picture: Fewer than one-quarter of the parents polled said they had a 529 account for their children and 43% said they've never heard of a 529 at all. Roughly 18% said they aren't contributing because they didn't realize the funds could be used for education expenses beyond college, such as K-12 private school tuition or trade and vocational programs — not to mention that Donald Trump's massive tax and spending package expanded 529 qualified education expenses even further to include educational therapies and tutoring, among other costs, for students starting in kindergarten.

Rehman, the ministry spokesperson, said local authorities have been instructed to engage with Afghan community leaders to encourage voluntary repatriation and that there are plans to close down refugee camps, but no dates have been decided on.

Article: They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: Shares of AMD shed 6% in Wednesday's premarket trading hours after the chipmaker reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, missing the 49 cents per share analysts polled by LSEG had forecast. "AMD's Q2 results were decent at first glance ($7,685M/$0.48 vs Street $7,428M/$0.49), though the beat was entirely driven by Gaming, with a slight miss in Client and roughly in-line results for Data Center and Embedded. Gross margins as-reported came in slightly stronger than expectations, and roughly inline ex-charges, however overall profitability was impacted by higher than expected opex … Overall AMD's print wasn't awful; however it also didn't show any upside in anything that investors really care about (a problem for any stock that is up almost 80% since their last earnings report)." Goldman Sachs stands by neutral rating, raises price target to $150 from $140 Goldman's new forecast is 14% below AMD's current valuation. "We remain constructive on the company's ability to drive significant market share gains in the PC and enterprise server markets in the near term; however, we are more guarded on the company's ability to drive significant scale in Datacenter GPUs over time, and think operating leverage is likely to be hampered by the significant OpEx we believe is needed for the company to support its software and systems efforts tied to datacenters." Deutsche Bank maintains hold rating and lifts price target to $150 per share from $130 "Overall, we remain impressed with AMD's execution across its array of product lines, expecting solid growth to continue in CPUs and likely accelerate in DC GPUs. However, even with these growth drivers reflected in our model (CY25E EPS ~unchanged, CY26E ~ +10%), we see EPS power in the ~$6-7 range as largely being reflected in a current valuation (~25-30x P/E)." Morgan Stanley keeps equal-weight rating, lowers price objective to $168 from $185 Morgan Stanley's revised forecast calls for 4% downside. Lack of strong near term upside in GPU likely needed for stock to continue to maintain its premium, but MI400 is unchanged as a source of 2025 optimism — and key driver of value for the stock." JPMorgan reiterates neutral rating and hikes price target to $180 from $120 The bank's new price objective is approximately 3% higher than where shares of AMD closed on Tuesday. "AMD is improving its competitiveness across CPU and GPU products with Ryzen, EPYC, and Radeon Vega platforms and is on track to improve its market share and drive meaningful revenue growth in the near term. AMD is executing well toward its target financial model, but we remain Neutral as shares appear to be nearly fully valued." Wells Fargo stands by overweight rating and reiterates $185 price target Analyst Aaron Rakers' forecast is 6% above AMD's Tuesday closing price. "View 2Q25 results + 3Q25 as positive; see increasing confidence in materializing 2H25 MI355X ramp and note that 3Q25 guide does not include any MI308X contributions." Barclays maintains overweight rating, raises price target to $200 from $130 The bank's revised forecast implies 15% upside ahead. There are multiple ways to win with this name into '26 as Client and DC both hit their stride." Bank of America keeps buy rating, $200 price target "AMD continues to execute on its AI GPU pipeline, with the MI355X (Blackwell-compete) on track to volume ramp in 2H at multiple customers and the MI400 Series (Rubin-compete) and its Helios rack system also on track for 2026 launch. Overall, we expect AMD to be a consistent ~20%+ FCF generator over time." UBS reiterates buy rating and $210 per share price target The bank's forecast corresponds to a 20% upside. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases.

Article: That may not sound like much in the U.S., but it's nearly double the estimated living wage of about $6 a day for rural Mozambique , where Luís lives — and way more than he was earning just a year ago. Luís says he "didn't want to receive the money and just see it disappear from his hands," speaking in Emakhuwa, the local language in his village of Muvuruta in northeastern Mozambique. Sponsor Message "All of our pure cash USAID programs were ended," says Yolande Wright , vice president of partnerships at GiveDirectly, including $20 million that was to be delivered to the nonprofit from USAID this year. GiveDirectly gets funds from a variety of sources for its programs that give cash to people living in poverty like Luís and also to people at risk of joining violent extremist groups and to victims of natural disasters like earthquakes. After years of skepticism toward cash, last fall USAID full-throatedly embraced the model , stating it should become "a core element of its development toolkit." Now, the Trump administration has cast a pall of uncertainty around cash's future. In addition to withdrawing from foreign aid generally, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce signaled a shift away from cash in an April press conference, citing deep-rooted worries on the right about misuse and fraud. Some are trying to make the case to lawmakers as they hash out next year's budget that cash is a more effective, efficient and transparent way to deliver aid — one that doesn't require the bloated bureaucracy decried by the Trump administration. "And there's evidence to show it, like hundreds of studies." From underdog to darling A little over a decade ago, the idea of USAID, or any aid agency, simply giving someone like Luís $1,000 was largely unheard of, says Daniel Handel, policy director at Unlock Aid, a foreign aid think tank. I got forcibly reassigned because of it." But by fall 2024, USAID was embracing the model, putting out strategy documents arguing cash should be a core element of its developmental toolkit. "There's now a substantial evidence base supporting the fact that unconditional cash transfer programs improve the well-being of the transfer recipients and their family," says Alison Fahey , director of partnerships and strategic initiatives at The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT. "Across an accumulation of studies, we see people increasing their spending , improved food security , higher income , higher savings , better mental wellbeing , their kids are more likely to be in school ." Those benefits, Fahey says, come because cash gives people power — they can buy the things they know they need or invest in things they'd previously only dreamed of. From 2017 to 2022, cash aid's slice of total humanitarian assistance went from about 15% to about 24% — more than $10 billion — according to an analysis by the CALP Network, a group of over 90 organizations involved in cash assistance. In the April press briefing , State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that some cash aid programs were cancelled "because they provided cash-based assistance, which the administration is moving away from," citing concerns about misuse and fraud. In 2023, some GiveDirectly staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo stole over $1 million intended for families in extreme poverty, roughly 1% of the total cash dispensed by GiveDirectly that year. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio seemed to express some support for cash transfers over traditional USAID programs in a congressional hearing when discussing why some programs got cancelled. … In some cases, [aid should go] directly to the person, the group on the ground." Advocates see the cash transfer model, which doesn't require that money move through layers of bureaucracy, as one that could resonate with the administration.

Article: PLAINS, Georgia — Protestant churches often have two flags at the front of their sanctuaries, the American flag on the left and the white banner, blue rectangle and red cross of the Christian flag on the right. Advertisement The drama at Maranatha, where the 39th president taught Sunday school for years, is emblematic of how Plains is trying to move forward now that the town — for the first time in at least a half-century — is not completely defined by Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. One key draw is the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, and many are anxious over how the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts for the National Park Service could affect it. Jan Williams, a longtime friend of the Carters and, along with husband George, part of a once-competing peanut business, fears Maranatha will become nothing but a monument to the former president.

Advertisement As with the church flag kerfuffle, the yard signs were illustrative of people feeling more comfortable expressing their political views now that Jimmy and Rosalynn weren’t riding their bikes around town. “Plains has never been all Democratic or all Republican, but for the most part it’s always been very conservative,” said Phil Wise, a Plains native, architect of Carter’s 1976 Florida win and later White House aide.

(Formula TV via AP, File) A prominent Georgian journalist was convicted Wednesday of slapping a senior police officer during an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as curbing press freedom. The case is just one of many to draw protests and international criticism in recent months as the ruling Georgian Dream party has been accused of eroding civil society and democratic rights in the South Caucasus nation. In a joint statement in January, 14 embassies, including those of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., said Amaghlobeli’s case represented “another worrying example of the intimidation of journalists in Georgia, restricting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Gypsy Guillén Kaiser, advocacy and communications director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned that Amaghlobeli’s case was “a sign of the declining environment for press freedom in Georgia and a symbol for the fight between truth and control.” “You have to decide whether you’re going to vilify journalists, criminalize them, and present them as nefarious characters with malicious intent in order to control information, or whether you’re going to have a public that is truly free, freely informed and empowered,” Guillén Kaiser said. But this will not succeed — we will defend the interests of our state to the end.” Georgia has seen widespread political unrest and protests since its parliamentary election on Oct. Nearly all the leaders of Georgia’s pro-Western opposition parties have been jailed for refusing to testify at a parliamentary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, a probe that critics of Georgian Dream say is an act of political revenge. The critics accuse Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the party has denied. Among controversial legislation passed by Georgian Dream is the so-called “ foreign influence law," which requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power.” That law later was replaced with one called the Foreign Agent’s Registration Act, under which individuals or organizations considered as “agents of a foreign principal” must register with the government or face penalties, including criminal prosecution and imprisonment. “I think that the main goal of the government was to scare us, for us to leave the country or shut down or change profession,” says Mariam Nikuradze, founder of the OC Media outlet.

Powered by People has been putting funds aside since Trump's directive, and O'Rourke assured the caucus in the weeks leading up to the potential vote, if they wished to leave the state, they would have his support, both in rhetoric and cash. The O'Rourke spokesperson, who noted that O'Rourke's donor pool reaches all the way back to his 2018 Senate bid, said the group plans to release details on how much they've been able to fundraise to help support the quorum break efforts at some point. A spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus told ABC News that "members are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support from citizens across Texas and the country who stand with them." And they reiterated that the effort is being expensed legally. He denied all the allegations, calling them at the time a partisan "sham." He called the ensuing impeachment proceedings an "ugly spectacle," adding that they were "never meant to be fair or just." The Texas Senate acquitted Paxton in September 2023.

Article: prosecutors won’t seek the death penalty in their cases against Mexican drug lords Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero FILE - This image released by the FBI shows the wanted posted for Rafael Caro Quintero. prosecutors said Tuesday they won't seek the death penalty in their cases against Mexican cartel kingpin Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero, the drug lord charged with orchestrating the 1985 killing of a U.S. Caro Quintero’s attorney, Elizabeth Macedonio, said she and her client “look forward to resolving this matter quickly to bring closure to all parties.” Zambada's lawyer, Frank Perez, said the government's decision “marks an important step toward achieving a fair and just resolution.” Prosecutors said last winter that they were having plea discussions with Perez. Prosecutors wouldn't comment further Tuesday after telling judges in brief letters that Attorney General Pam Bondi had directed them not to pursue capital punishment for Caro Quintero, Zambada, or a third defendant, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, known as “The Viceroy." Sent from Mexico to the U.S. Carrillo Fuentes' lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, said he and his client “are very thankful and think it was the right decision.” The cases are unfolding in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where infamous Sinaloa cartel co-founder Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was tried and convicted. While Zambada was seen as the cartel's strategist and dealmaker, prosecutors have said he also was enmeshed in its violence, at one point ordering the murder of his own nephew. The White House has called him “one of the most evil cartel bosses in the world." Prosecutors say he is responsible for sending tons of heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine into the U.S.

Article: Florida Gov_ Ron DeSantis’ administration is apparently preparing to build a second immigration detention center, awarding at least one contract for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.” FILE - A sign marks the entrance to Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, a site used by the Florida National Guard, near Starke, Fla., July 15, 2025. (AP Photo/David Fischer, File) FILE - A sign marks the entrance to Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, a site used by the Florida National Guard, near Starke, Fla., July 15, 2025. Ron DeSantis ' administration is apparently preparing to build a second immigration detention center, awarding at least one contract for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.” The site would add to the capacity at the state's first detention facility, built at an isolated airfield in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz." Already, state officials have inked more than $245 million in contracts for that facility, which officially opened July 1. Florida plans to build a second detention center at a Florida National Guard training center called Camp Blanding, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) southwest of downtown Jacksonville, though DeSantis has said the state is waiting for federal officials to ramp up deportations from the South Florida facility before building out the Camp Blanding site. Civil rights advocates and environmental groups have filed lawsuits against the Everglades facility, where detainees allege they've been forced to go without adequate food and medical care, and been barred from meeting with their attorneys, held without any charges and unable to get a federal immigration court to hear their cases. President Donald Trump has touted the facility’s harshness and remoteness as fit for the “worst of the worst," while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the South Florida detention center can serve as a model for other state-run holding facilities for immigrants. The Florida Division of Emergency Management, the state agency that built the Everglades facility, has awarded a $39,000 contract for a portable emergency response weather station and two lightning sirens for what's been dubbed the “North Detention Facility," according to records in the state’s public contract database. The equipment will help enable “real-time weather monitoring and safety alerting for staff." The contract comes as the state approaches the peak of hurricane season, and as heavy rains and extreme heat have pounded parts of Florida. Immigrant advocates and environmentalists have raised a host of concerns about the Everglades facility, a remote compound of heavy-duty tents and trailers that state workers and contractors assembled in a matter of days. Last week, FDEM released a heavily redacted draft emergency evacuation plan for what the document called the “South Florida Detention Facility.” Entire sections related to detainee transportation, evacuation and relocation procedures were blacked out, under a Florida law that allows state agencies to make their emergency plans confidential. Questioned by reporters on July 25, FDEM executive director Kevin Guthrie defended the emergency response agency's plans for the makeshift facility, which he says is built to withstand a Category 2 hurricane, which packs winds of up to 110 mph.

Article: Attorneys for over 200 women are calling for a federal investigation of alleged sexual abuse they say was rampant for decades at juvenile bootcamps run by the Los Angeles County probation department LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys representing over 200 women said Tuesday they want the federal government to investigate allegations of rampant sexual abuse that occurred over decades at juvenile bootcamps run by the Los Angeles County probation department. The request comes months after Los Angeles County officials agreed to a $4 billion payout to settle 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, the largest sex abuse settlement in U.S. The attorneys' clients were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they were sent to camps designated for “at-risk youth” who had committed minor offenses, separate from the juvenile halls. John Manly, one of the attorneys, said during a news conference Tuesday that the camps were akin to the island owned by Jeffrey Epstein where he allegedly brought underage girls to be exploited. “The sad and unbelievable truth is these camps were dens of sexual predation where LA County probation officers in charge of helping these children get on track turned them into human sex toys,” the attorneys said. His colleague, Courtney Thom, said one former deputy probation officer, Thomas Jackson, had been accused by at least 30 women of sexual assault during their time in the custody of the probation department. "When our client was released back to her grandmother, this deputy probation officer went out to her home and would take her from her home to areas within the community to continue sexually abusing her and continued to contact her and torment her throughout her adult life as well,” Thom said. As usual, the county abandoned their defense and blamed the employees.” Jackson’s case was referred by the county to prosecutors for investigation in December 2023 but they declined to prosecute because the alleged incidents happened too long ago, according to an April 7 memo, the Los Angeles Times reported. how can anyone assure this won’t happen again?” The county’s Office of County Counsel said in a statement that it is working with authorities to hold those who committed abuse accountable, but records are no longer available in many of the cases. “In addition, plaintiffs’ attorneys have not produced evidence enabling the County to identify perpetrators in the vast majority of claims." Nonetheless, the statement said, the county "wholeheartedly supports efforts to ensure that those who have committed crimes against minors are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” The plaintiffs in the $4 billion settlement were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years. Manly and Thom have represented plaintiffs in several high-profile sexual abuse cases, including gymnasts in their lawsuit against USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports doctor Larry Nassar, who was accused by more than 300 women and girls of sexual assault and is serving three prison sentences that will likely keep him locked up for life. The letter also called for an investigation of whether the county concealed allegations of ongoing abuse at the juvenile facilities when the Justice Department investigated the facilities in 2006 and established a federal monitor in 2008.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) A plinth that once held a statue of Confederate general Albert Pike is seen in a park near the headquarters of the Department of Labor on Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- Two Washington, D.C.-area statues commemorating the Confederacy will be restored and replaced, in line with President Donald Trump's pushback on recent efforts to reframe America's historical narrative. The National Park Service announced Monday that the statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate brigadier general and a revered figure among Freemasons, would resume its previous position in Washington's Judiciary Square, a few blocks from the U.S. The statue was pulled down with ropes and chains on Juneteenth in 2020 as part of mass protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. The Pike statue restoration, which is targeted for October, “aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and reinstate pre-existing statues,” the park service said in a statement. Unlike the Left, we don’t believe in erasing American history — we honor it.” In 2022, an independent commission recommended that the memorial be taken down, as part of its final report to Congress on renaming of military bases and assets that commemorate the Confederacy. Some of the figures also on the statue include a Black woman depicted as “Mammy” holding what is said to be the child of a white officer, and an enslaved man following his owner to war. In March, Trump issued an executive order entitled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” It decried post-Floyd efforts to reinterpret American history, stating, “rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame." The order targeted the Smithsonian network of museums as having “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” It also instructed the Interior Department to restore any statue or display that was “removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.” Pike, who died in 1891, is more known for his decades-long stint as a senior leader of the Freemasons than for his Confederate military career. When protesters toppled the statue in 2020 while police officers looked on, Trump — then in his first term — called it “a disgrace to our Country” on social media and called for their immediate arrests.

"We claimed it together, and, Detroit, I believe that our best days are ahead of us.” She said the primary win belongs to every boy or girl told to “dream small,” every neighborhood where people feel left behind, every senior who “paved the way” and every college student who wants to stay in the city. “It’s time we reckoned with reality, that far too many Detroiters feel left out.” The continued growth of the city could be at stake since Duggan, who is running for Michigan's governor in 2026 as an independent, has helmed Detroit as it exited the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. The next mayor will inherit a city on much firmer footing than the one Duggan was elected to lead in 2013 when an emergency manager installed by the state to oversee the city's flailing finances filed for bankruptcy on its behalf.

Republican leaders have frequently seized on episodes of violence to portray the city as a case study of violence in cities run by Democratic mayors, even as city officials note that violent crime overall is down more than 25% from the same period last year.

When the other officer arrived, Mills told him Johnson did not have a gun but said Johnson had tried to disarm him several times, according to police body camera footage. The lawsuit said Johnson, who was Black and a standup comedian, was having a mental health crisis when he was killed at a vast remote airport parking lot near where he lived. Employees had called 911 five times over about two hours asking for police to check on Johnson as he walked barefoot on the lot’s hot pavement, according to the lawsuit and information previously released by police. Mills responded alone after the employees reported that Johnson was “trying to fight them.” Johnson did not respond to Mills’ questions and rushed toward the officer, according to body camera footage. After Mills pushed Johnson off him and ordered him to move back, Mills pulled out his gun and said he would shoot Johnson if he didn’t get on the ground. District Attorney Brian Mason has not yet decided whether the shooting was justified or criminal charges should be filed following an investigation by other area law enforcement agencies, his spokesperson, Christopher Hopper, said. At a May 29 press conference on the shooting, Aurora police Chief Todd Chamberlain said that “the absence of a weapon does not mean there is an absence of danger.” Johnson's mother, Taushica Carter, said that as a military veteran, she has trouble understanding how someone who took an oath to uphold the law killed her only child.

Article: Brazilians are divided over a house arrest order against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office Division among Brazilians over Bolsonaro house arrest order could set the tone for next election Demonstrators rally in support of former President Jair Bolsonaro at the entrance to his residential complex, to denounce his house arrest order by the Supreme Court, in Brasília, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) Demonstrators rally in support of former President Jair Bolsonaro at the entrance to his residential complex, to denounce his house arrest order by the Supreme Court, in Brasília, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) SAO PAULO -- Brazilians were divided Tuesday over a house arrest order against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office. Supporters of the far-right leader and some moderates see the ruling as harsh, while allies of incumbent President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other moderates want to move on and leave the issue for the judiciary. “One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,” the analyst said. “The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.” Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who put Bolsonaro on trial for his alleged role in the coup plot to keep him in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election, ordered the 70-year-old former president's arrest for violating precautionary measures imposed on him by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons. The polarization between supporters and critics of the former president took Brazil's congress by storm Tuesday and was also reflected in figures from pollster Quaest, which say 53% are favorable to the order against the far-right leader and 47% against it. Since de Moraes’ order, Bolsonaro allies are pledging to stop congress unless an amnesty bill is passed in favor of the far-right leader and his supporters involved in the coup plot probe. “I've already told speaker Hugo Motta that I will do that in the first moment I am working as the speaker of the house during one of his trips abroad,” Cortes said. We need to start working with respect, civility and dialogue so congress can fulfill its mission in favor of Brazil and our population.” Members of Brazil's opposition say such a move would also allow Bolsonaro to run in next year's election, from which he was barred by the country's top electoral court for abuse of power in 2022. Meanwhile, Lula and his allies initially showed they wanted to move past the issue of Bolsonaro's house arrest and focus on trade negotiations with Trump, who imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian import goods starting Wednesday. If the next Brazilian election has the same standard of the previous face off between Lula and Bolsonaro, the winner will be decided by turnout and a very slim number of moderates. Eduardo Leite, a moderate from the Rio Grande do Sul state, embodied the split among many Brazilian voters who will likely have to chose one of the two camps in 2026. "I don't like the idea of a former president not being able to speak, and even less see him get arrested for that before he is put on trial at the Supreme Court,” Leite said. “Our country does not deserve to remain hostage to this legal-political tug of war that only hinders us all.” Gilberto Kassab, the chairman of the centrist Social Democratic Party, has both Bolsonaro and Lula supporters in his party's ranks and said “exaggeration on both sides are contaminating Brazil.” “I express my solidarity to the former president, I regret his arrest without discussing the merits of the issue.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states Things to know about the Voting Rights Act and the cases that could unravel it FILE - Luci Baines Johnson looks at the desk May 16, 2023, on display at the LBJ Presidential Library, that President Lyndon B. His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Article: The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 60 years ago but has been slowly eroding for more than a decade The Voting Rights Act marks its 60th anniversary as its core provisions are being eroded North Dakota Democratic Rep. Jayme Davis poses for a photo in her office with a 2024 campaign sign on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at Turtle Mountain Administrative Offices on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color." The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1, saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect." The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill, but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

Article: House Several states consider redrawing congressional maps after Texas kicks off fight Empty chairs belonging to House Democrats remain empty during a session convocation in the State Capitol, Tuesday, Aug. But President Donald Trump's call for Texas to blatantly redraw the maps to better ensure that Republicans retain control of the House in the 2026 elections has blown the lid off of the practice. In response to events in Texas, Democrats in California are considering a draft proposal to reshape their own district maps and cut away five Republican seats while securing more precarious seats already held by Democrats. Kathy Hochul said if Texas proceeds, “we must do the same.” The proposal, however, would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the legislature twice and be approved by voters. The House Majority leader, David Moon, a Democrat, says he will sponsor legislation to trigger redistricting in Maryland if Texas or any other state holds redistricting ahead of the census. Ron DeSantis has said he was considering early redistricting and “working through what that would look like.” That's because a law in the Republican-led state requires it before the 2026 midterm elections. ____ Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

Article: government personnel to leave a region in the north of the country affected by a toxic spill from a Chinese-owned mine that happened six months ago 6 months after toxic mine spill in northern Zambia, US Embassy orders personnel out of the area FILE - This image taken from video Wednesday, Feb. The embassy said in an alert on social media that new information revealed that “hazardous and carcinogenic substances” including arsenic, cyanide, uranium and other heavy metals had polluted a major river system flowing through the town of Chambishi and the nearby city of Kitwe, and had possibly become airborne, following an accident at the mine in February. Environmentalists and others raised concerns over the extent of the damage months ago following the spill at the mine run by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a division of China's state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining group. The spill happened when a tailings dam that holds acidic and heavy metals waste from the mine collapsed, according to investigators from the Engineering Institution of Zambia, resulting in some 50 million liters (13.2 million gallons) of toxic materials flowing into the Kafue River system. Within days of the spill, dead fish could be seen up to 100 kilometers (60 miles) downstream, raising fears that the contamination could affect millions living along the Kafue River, which runs for 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) through the heart of the southern African country. Sino-Metals apologized and committed to help with cleanup efforts, which included the Zambian Air Force dumping hundreds of tons of lime into the river in an attempt to counteract the acidic waste.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to.

Article: The EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website . Landlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away," said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform. Cambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists. "It's a $32 million program for the government, but it provides, in terms of return on investment — it's huge," said Nicole Upano, director of public policy for the NAA. "It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program." If Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.

Lawyers from the free speech group, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, brought the lawsuit on behalf of the student newspaper at Stanford University, the Stanford Daily, arguing that several of its staff members have been forced to self-censor or quit the paper out of fear that the government could retaliate for what it publishes. The lawsuit says that the newspaper, which is open to all students and has more than 200 members, has weathered resignations and withdrawn stories by noncitizens who were concerned that publishing content about Israel or the conditions in Gaza could leave them vulnerable to deportation.

"If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member bloc economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy." Last month, Trump likened the trade deal with Japan, which includes a pledge of $550 billion in investment, to "seed money." "Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the President reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Moreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview. "The European Union and her Member States have very limited capabilities to direct private actors to make these purchases and investments," David Kleimann, a trade expert and senior research associate at ODI Europe, told CNBC. Shuji Kajiyama | Via Reuters As part of the deal, the White House says that Japan "will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries." Japan, on the other hand, says the deal involves a mix of investments and loan guarantees totaling a maximum of up to $550 billion, Bloomberg reports. "But such claims are completely off the mark."

Article: Fugitive jailed for murder of mother walking dog Just now Share Save Alice Cunningham & Laura Foster BBC News, Suffolk Reporting from Ipswich Crown Court Share Save Suffolk Police A man has been jailed for the murder of Anita Rose who died after being attacked while walking her dog near her home village of Brantham, Suffolk A "dangerous" fugitive who savagely murdered a woman while she was walking her dog has been jailed for life. Anita died four days after she was found with serious injuries and Barclay, 56, of no fixed address, was sentenced to a mandatory life term of life - and will serve a minimum of 25 years after he was found guilty of murder following a trial at Ipswich Crown Court. Suffolk Police Roy Barclay was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the murder of Anita Rose On the day she was attacked Anita left her house at about 05:00 (BST). BBC Crimewatch A statement from Richard Jones, Anita Rose's partner, was read during the hearing At the time of the attack, Barclay had been wanted on recall to prison having breached the conditions of his licence. Suffolk Police Barclay had been captured on CCTV in the Brantham area on the day Anita was attacked The court first heard how Anita had enjoyed living in Brantham and had taken to help neighbours and other vulnerable residents when they were in need. Her daughter, Gemma Rose, described the "immeasurable" loss and revealed she had taken to telling her own children about "how dangerous the world is" in an effort to protect them. One of her sons, Ashley Rose, told the court he had desperately tried to help the investigation by buying a drone to find some of his mother's personal items that had been missing and were later found in Barclay's possession. Suffolk Police Barclay had been living in a camp in Brantham when he attacked Anita Judge Levett said Barclay was an "unpredictable, dangerous" man who was "prone to terrible outbursts of violence at the slightest confrontation". Barclay only served five years in prison before he was released on parole but Judge Levett told him this should have been enough time for him to work on his "temper". Watch: How a man who murdered a woman was caught Judge Levett also questioned why Barclay had chosen to remain silent by not answering police questions when he was arrested or why he did not give evidence in his trial. "It may have been her challenging you about what you were doing, she may have caught you doing things which caused offence, but I am satisfied so as to be sure that, for whatever reason, at the time of the incident your intention was to kill Anita and not simply to cause her really serious harm." Barclay had previously pleaded guilty to remaining at large after being recalled to prison. "Three days after the attack he left Anita's phone in Ipswich enabling it to fall into the hands of others while causing a distraction and diverting significant resources, this ultimately led to his downfall with further CCTV obtained capturing his actions." Nicola Pope, of the Crown Prosecution Service, similarly described the attack as "savage". "By carefully building a case with DNA recovered from Anita's belonging and sightings on CCTV – combined with previous bad character evidence against Barclay – we were able to present a clear picture to the jury."

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to convene his security cabinet on Thursday to discuss expanding Israel’s military campaign into the rest of Gaza, even amid growing domestic criticism that such a step would endanger the lives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in the enclave. Netanyahu’s high-stakes proposal comes as the last military operation, which began in mid-March, has come to a virtual standstill and as negotiations with Hamas for a cease-fire and a hostage-for-prisoner exchange have reached an impasse. A hunger crisis in Gaza, which many aid agencies and foreign governments blame on Israeli policies, has spurred an international diplomatic backlash against Israel, including from some of its closest traditional allies. In Israel, the proposal to extend the military takeover of the enclave into the heart of Gaza City and central areas of the territory, where officials believe hostages are being held, is causing growing concern, especially among the families of the hostages and their supporters.

(AP Photo, File) FILE - In this image taken from video, President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera arrives at a polling station in Bangui, Central African Republic, Sunday, July 30, 2023. (AP Photo, File) BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow's state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic's government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow's demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). "Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an x-ray, an ultrasound machine, and a bone density scanner -- all owned by the town. "This is important for our community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, "in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important." According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents. Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors -- by 2035. "This is a huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community." In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here. "It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends." Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said. "We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before," he said, "and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on." Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. He was kind of a different kind of physician." Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a 3-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June. Camron Browning, MD, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist. "My goal," he said, "was to be able to come home and serve my hometown." Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice. After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency. "This was always my dream."

Article: Kennedy Jr.'s statements before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday revealed a concerning lack of knowledge about the major health programs he'd oversee, should he be confirmed as HHS secretary. The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are narrow." In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income. Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program." He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues -- who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is "fully paid for by the federal government," when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees. Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be "rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges." "He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with," Benjamin said. Also, "he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true." Benjamin was asked -- given the number of Kennedy's misstatements -- whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles. [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does." Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite a few instances of disinformation." Multiple times, he suggested "that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll." Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, "Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID." Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations -- which he now denies -- raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.

Article: The mall-based boutique, long known for its ear piercing services and eclectic mix of jewelry and accessories, is staring down about $500 million in debt, rising competition and an evolving retail landscape that's made it harder than ever to grow a business profitably. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders," CEO Chris Cramer said in a news release. "We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives." The company said stores will continue to operate as it looks to monetize its assets and continues a review of "strategic alternatives," which could mean finding a buyer that's willing to keep the business running. Tariffs are expected to impact its supply chain, and sleeker, savvier competitors have entered the market, such as Studs and Lovisa, the upstart ear piercing chains that have promised a safer, and cooler, approach to piercings. This is more attuned to what younger consumers want and has left Claire's looking somewhat out of step with modern demand," GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note.

Article: 27 minutes ago Share Save James Gallagher • @JamesTGallagher Health and science correspondent Share Save Getty Images mRNA vaccines were heralded as a medical marvel that saved lives during the Covid pandemic, but now the US is pulling back from researching them. And another question is where should mRNA vaccines fit into the pantheon of other vaccine technologies - because there are many: Inactivated vaccines use the original virus or bacterium, kill it, and use that to train the immune system - such as the annual flu shot use the original virus or bacterium, kill it, and use that to train the immune system - such as the annual flu shot Attenuated vaccines do not kill the infectious agent, but make it weaker so it causes a mild infection - such as the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine do not kill the infectious agent, but make it weaker so it causes a mild infection - such as the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine Conjugate vaccines use bits of protein or sugar from a bug, so it triggers an immune response without causing an infection - like for whooping cough use bits of protein or sugar from a bug, so it triggers an immune response without causing an infection - like for whooping cough mRNA vaccines use a fragment of genetic code that temporarily instructs the body to make parts of a virus, and the immune system reacts to that Each has advantages and disadvantages, but Prof Finn argues we "overhyped" mRNA vaccines during the pandemic to the exclusion of other approaches, and now there is a process of adjusting. The claim that mRNA vaccines do not protect against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu "just isn't true", says Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Vaccine Group, who is soon stepping down as the head of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government. The same measles or HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case.

Earlier, Witkoff took an early morning stroll through Zaryadye Park, a stone’s throw from the Kremlin, with Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian president’s envoy for investment and economic cooperation, footage aired by TASS showed. Dmitriev said later on social platform X that “dialogue will prevail.” READ MORE: Russia will no longer aide by self-imposed moratorium on intermediate-range missiles Dmitriev played a key role in three rounds of direct talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in recent months, as well as discussions between Russian and U.S. A Russian offensive that started in the spring and is expected to continue through the fall is advancing faster than last year’s push but is making only slow and costly gains and has been unable to take any major cities. On Tuesday, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” regarding his threat to slap tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, which could increase import taxes dramatically on China and India. The Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis warned in an assessment this week that there are “clear signs that the Kremlin is preparing for a broader confrontation with NATO,” including a military build-up along Russia’s western flank with alliance countries in recent years. Russia announced Tuesday that it no longer regards itself as bound by a self-imposed moratorium on the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race.

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's . Steel – but it's unclear how new leadership at the FTC and Department of Justice will view mergers in the retail industry, which can be felt more acutely by consumers. Amanda Lewis, who spent close to a decade scrutinizing mergers at the FTC and is now a partner at Cuneo Gilbert and LaDuca, previously told CNBC the merger is unlikely to raise many concerns because combined, Dick's and Foot Locker would represent around 15% of the sporting goods market.

As long as pharmaceutical products — which are key Swiss exports — are not affected by tariffs, their impact on economic growth may be limited, Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. "Here, Switzerland has leverage via US pharma reliance, but it must tread carefully — one misstep could trigger a devastating 39% tariff on its most valuable sector."

Article: Hiroshima survivors fear rising nuclear threat on the 80th anniversary of atomic bombing toggle caption Louise Delmotte/AP HIROSHIMA, Japan — Hiroshima on Wednesday marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. "There will be nobody left to pass on this sad and painful experience in 10 years or 20 years," Minoru Suzuto, a 94-year-old survivor, said after he kneeled down to pray at the cenotaph. Mayor says world should have learned from tragedy Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui warned against a growing acceptance of military buildups and of using nuclear weapons for national security during Russia's war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Mideast, with the United States and Russia possessing most of the world's nuclear warheads. "They threaten to topple the peacebuilding frameworks so many have worked so hard to construct." He urged younger generations to recognize that such "misguided policies" could cause "utterly inhumane" consequences for their future. "We don't have much time left, while we face a greater nuclear threat than ever," said Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese grassroots organization of survivors that won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for its pursuit of nuclear abolishment. Hours before the official ceremony, as the sun rose over Hiroshima, survivors and their families started paying tribute to the victims at the Peace Memorial Park, near the hypocenter of the nuclear blast 80 years ago. Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, noting Nihon Hidankyo's Nobel Peace Prize and countries' re-commitment to a nuclear free world in "the Pact for the Future" adopted last year. Guterres stressed the importance to carry forward the survivors' testimony and message of peace and added: "Remembering the past is about protecting and building peace today and in the future." Near Hiroshima's iconic Atomic Bomb Dome under high security, more than 200 protesters gathered, holding posters and flags carrying messages such as "No Nuke, Stop War" and "Free Gaza! toggle caption Louise Delmotte/AP Survivors want nuclear abolishment, not deterrence Wednesday's anniversary comes at a time when possession of nuclear weapons for deterrence is increasingly supported by the international community, including Japan. Sponsor Message Some survivors said they were disappointed by President Donald Trump's recent remark justifying Washington's attack on Iran in June by comparing it to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the mild response from the Japanese government. "I don't think we can get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it was justified by the assailant." In the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said Wednesday that he was praying for those who suffered physical, psychological and social effects from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, adding that the event remains "a universal warning against the devastation caused by wars and, in particular, by nuclear weapons." Japan seeks US nuclear protection Japan's government has rejected the survivors' request to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or attend its meetings as observers because it is under the protection of the U.S. Matsui, the city's mayor, in his speech Wednesday, urged Japan's government to sign and ratify the nuclear weapons ban treaty, a request also made by several groups of survivors in their meeting with Ishiba after the ceremony. Past prime ministers have stressed Japan's status as the world's only country to have suffered nuclear attacks and have said Japan is determined to pursue peace, but survivors say it's a hollow promise.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) The Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.” “Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” she said. The new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York, California and Connecticut, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois. The administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a “non-sanctuary city.” The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a “Page Not Found” error message. The administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

Article: Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre” at the Santa Fe Opera House This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. (Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

Sponsor Message But in a sign that some new penalties over Russia's war were already underway, President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order saying he would slap an extra 25% tariff on India over its purchases of Russian oil. Yuri Ushakov, an adviser to Putin, was quoted by state media as calling the discussions "useful" and "constructive." Ushakov added that while the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the "Ukraine issue," they also discussed "perspectives for possible strategic cooperation" between the US and Russia. Trump is frustrated The meeting came as President Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin over his failure to suspend attacks on Ukrainian cities despite months of U.S.-led peace efforts. Trump had campaigned to return to office vowing he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin developed over his first term in office to end the war in "24 hours." But Trump says his patience has grown thin with daily reports of Ukrainian civilian casualties from Russian attacks. Europe Trump cuts deadline for Russia to reach peace deal with Ukraine Trump cuts deadline for Russia to reach peace deal with Ukraine Listen · 3:31 3:31 Soon Trump upped his ultimatum, announcing last week that Russia had just "10 or 12 days" before to make peace. When asked later if there was a way for Russia to avoid the additional economic pressure, Trump told reporters Tuesday: "Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed." Trump also questioned whether any penalties could push Russia to change course. "In order to solve the issue in a peaceful way," continued Putin, "we need deep conversations, and not in public, but in the calm quiet of the negotiating process."

The tariffs would go into effect 21 days after the signing of the order, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes.

Article: So I've seen my share of meltdowns," he added, referring to the combination of two rails which were ultimately acquired after their consolidation by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway , as BNSF. Ferguson cited past deals in the rail sector in voicing his concerns, such as when CSX and Norfolk Southern acquired and divided up Conrail in 1997, and a similarly timed Union Pacific takeover of Southern Pacific. They need our voice if they're going to know how to do this on day one, and without us at the table, we're very fearful that they're going to make the same mistakes and create meltdowns." SMART Transportation Division (SMART-TD) has already stated its intention to petition the government to block the deal , with Union Pacific's safety record among its primary concerns. The merger , announced last week, would be the largest buyout ever in the rail sector, and would create the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail operator, combining Union Pacific's strength in the western U.S. The Union Pacific–Norfolk Southern merger, when approved, will benefit America, supporting reindustrialization and moving products more efficiently across the U.S.," a company spokesperson said, adding, "we have a history of implementing technology changes, such as NetControl across our 32,000-mile network without issue." On an analyst call hosted by the Union Pacific last week to discuss the deal, CEO Jim Vena told analysts that the combined companies will deliver faster, more comprehensive freight service to U.S. Craig Decker, managing director and lead of the transportation & logistics infrastructure investment banking team at Brown Gibbons Lang & Company, tells CNBC there could be the potential to displace or eliminate key transload, warehousing and container/chassis management at the intermodal interchange points as a result of the merger. He said the implications of this deal extend to "the various partners in the supply chain, including the trucking companies, whose relationships and networks have been configured and are dependent on their existing rail relationships." The key determinant in whether this merger will go through is the Surface Transportation Board, which has historically frowned on mergers of Class 1 freight rails, the largest rail networks in the U.S., according to Decker. "Under normal circumstances, I would say that the STB will disapprove of the deal as it did with CP/CSX, but given President Trump's willingness to tackle incredibly tough negotiations and his success thus far, his influence becomes the wildcard which will decide whether this deal eventually gets approved," he added. SMART-TD Ferguson said the union will go before the board and lay out its case that the deal is not good to keep commerce and transportation safely moving in the U.S. Ferguson tells CNBC that the risk to jobs from creating a new transcontinental rail network will extend well beyond the two freight rail companies in the transaction, and potentially hit labor across the middle of the country.

Article: Technicians stand next to an oil rig which is manufactured by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant, during a media tour of the plant in Dhamasna village in the western state of Gujarat, India, August 26, 2021. President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

Article: How Trump's secondary tariffs on Russia could hit the global economy 16 hours ago Share Save Jonathan Josephs • jonathanjosephs Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images "I used trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars", President Trump has said Despite being the world's most sanctioned country, Russia has continued to use its vast energy wealth to bankroll its war in Ukraine. Bloomberg Russia's vast energy industry has helped bankroll its invasion of Ukraine Increased energy prices "The key channel by which secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian energy could impact the global economy would be through the level of energy prices," says Kieran Tompkins from the consultancy Capital Economics. He explains that "the current backdrop is one where OPEC+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon." Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump. "That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them." Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images "The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable," the country's foreign ministry said Pricier iPhones from India Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. India calls Trump's tariff threat over Russian oil 'unjustified' US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone production to India - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. Imports to the US from India are already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up, and he told CNBC that number could be raised "very substantially". The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from India which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that's just 10% of 2021 levels. Derailing trade talks with China China is buying the most Russian oil, and a decision by President Trump to impose secondary tariffs on Chinese goods would be much more challenging to fulfil. That's because US imports from China are worth five times as much as those from India, and a lot more of those imports are consumer goods such as toys, clothes and electronics. Secondary tariffs aimed at Beijing would also risk upsetting a much broader renegotiation of trade between the world's two biggest economies that Trump has been pursuing since his first term in office. He explains that it would be "very difficult" to peel the Chinese away from the Russians without a good reason, given how closely Presidents Xi and Putin have worked together in recent years. On top of that, the last time Trump tried using triple-figure tariffs against China, he found it did not work - as it almost cut off all trade between the two countries. Further harm to US-EU commerce Analysis by the Finland-based Centre for Research and Clean Air shows that the EU and Turkey are also still amongst the biggest buyers of Russian energy. In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, acknowledged the problem, saying "Russia has repeatedly attempted to blackmail us by weaponizing its energy supplies" as she laid out plans to end imports by the end of 2027. The US-EU trade relationship is the biggest in the world, and the pair have just negotiated new trade terms which will see a 15% tariff be applied on most EU exports to the US.

Article: The quest to create gene-edited babies gets a reboot toggle caption VICTOR HABBICK VISIONS/Science Photo Library/Getty Images A Chinese scientist horrified the world in 2018 when he revealed he had secretly engineered the birth of the world's first gene-edited babies. Now, however, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, futurists, East Coast entrepreneurs, and pronatalists — who fear falling birth rates pose an existential threat to the human race — are eager to push the technology forward. "We want to be the company that does this in the light, with transparency and with good intentions," Cathy Tie, a biotech entrepreneur, told NPR in an interview about her new company, dubbed: Manhattan Project. We believe the scale of our mission, to end genetic disease, is just as significant as the original science behind Manhattan Project." Tie said she plans to move slowly and carefully, with stringent bioethical oversight, to explore a variety of gene-editing technologies. "Right now the goal is really just to inform regulators and the public what this technology is capable of — and what it's not — and hopefully empower regulators in the future, when proven safe and efficient, to allow research in this space," Tie said. "And I think that we have the responsibility to talk about this with patients that do have these terrible diseases and see if they want the option to not pass that on to future generations. Parents should have the choice." But the company would not go beyond preventing illnesses, such as the genetic lung disease cystic fibrosis and the inherited blood disorder beta thalassemia, she said. "We draw the line at disease prevention." She co-founded the firm with Eriona Hysolli, who headed biological sciences at Colossal Biosciences, which is working on a controversial project to use gene-editing to bring back extinct animals like the wooly mammoth. "I truly believe that these tools are very powerful and can lead to benefits to human health." The Manhattan Project did not reveal more details, including how much money had been raised, the investors or a timeline. Sponsor Message "We are definitely evaluating whether it makes sense to actually incubate and help build a company that we think could do this safely and responsibly," said Lucas Harrington, who co-founded SciFounders, a San Francisco venture capital firm. "I think there's huge benefit if it can be done safely and responsibly." Harrington envisions using newer and hopefully safer gene-editing techniques, such as "base editing," to modify embryos to make babies. The Chinese scientist used the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA much more easily than ever before but can cause potentially dangerous random mutations. "I think how we've been going about it until now has really been burying our head in the sand and not wanting to talk about it because it's too controversial," Harrington said. "The good that Bootstrap Bio can do is to basically speed up the development of this technology and also expand people's conception of what biotech is actually good for," said Chase Denecke, the CEO of the California startup Bootstrap Bio, Inc., on the podcast OpenSocietyWTF. "People can say, 'Well, you're playing God by using this type of technology.' And I say, 'People would say that with any technology of the past,' " said Malcolm Collins, a self-described pronatalist. "I'm really excited for a future within human history where there are some people that have decided to really lean into technologies like this," Malcolm Collins told NPR in an interview. And if people would like to start to do that at a genetic level they should have every right to do so." Room for painstaking science Many scientists favor carefully exploring the editing of DNA in human sperm, eggs and embryos to learn more about human reproduction and possibly someday prevent diseases. So I think that makes it even more dangerous and even more sinister." This new push comes as He Jiankui, the CRISPR babies scientist, has shifted from repentant to defiant since being released from prison. "Human heritable gene editing is clearly a terrible solution in search of a problem," said Tim Hunt, chief executive officer at the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, which along with the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy and the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy recently called for a 10-year moratorium on inheritable gene-editing. And I think that's a very dangerous way to approach these technologies," said Katie Hasson, the associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a genetics technology watchdog group in Berkeley, Calif. "I'm very worried that all of this together means we're headed straight into a new era of high-tech, market-based eugenics." But the Manhattan Project's Hysolli argues it would be unethical not to use the technology if it's safe.
