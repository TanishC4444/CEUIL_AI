Article: A retired Michigan autoworker got a Facebook message this summer from a stranger: Did you lose your wallet Richard Guilford holds up a lottery ticket he purchased 11 years ago during an interview Thursday, Aug. “If so,” a Minnesota man wrote, “it was in the engine bay of a car.” Richard Guilford couldn't believe what he was reading on his phone — a decade-old mystery was remarkably solved. Guilford's tri-fold leather wallet — stuffed with $15, a driver's license, work ID, gift cards worth $275 and lottery tickets — had turned up under the hood of a car in a repair shop in Lake Crystal, Minnesota. The filter box wouldn't snap in place after a repair, he said, “so I messed around a little bit and then pulled it back out and the wallet was sitting on a little ledge where it needed to snap down. He was certain he had lost it in a car, but figured it was on the floor of a Ford Flex, not an Edge, and certainly not in the engine. Guilford said he searched 30 to 40 cars, and his co-workers looked at dozens more, “just opening the doors up, looking under the seats, looking behind it.” “I can't take too much time to look for this because I gotta work.

Article: FPG | Archive Photos | Getty Images Ninety years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, which created the program that now sends monthly benefit checks to millions of Americans, including retirees, disabled individuals and families. Starting in 2033 — two years before its 100th anniversary — the program may only be able to pay 77% of scheduled benefits for retirees, their families and survivors, Social Security's trustees projected in an annual report released in June. Most, 83%, of surveyed Americans think Social Security reform should be a top priority for Congress, even if it means benefit cuts or tax increases for future beneficiaries, according to a new poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center's American Savings Education Council. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia., to co-lead a bipartisan pitch — the centerpiece of which is a new $1.5 trillion investment fund for Social Security, separate from Social Security's current trust funds. It would provide benefit increases for two cohorts — beneficiaries age 80 and older who are at less than 200% of the federal poverty level, and low earners who have a long work history earning low wages. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said while he applauded the first bipartisan plan to fix Social Security in two decades, he questions whether the plan could work. Larson's most recent proposal from 2023 would temporarily increase benefits for all beneficiaries, while also providing specific enhancements for those receiving minimum benefits; widows or widowers in two-income households; and children of deceased, disabled or retired workers who are full-time students.

Article: About 70 homeless encampments in the nation’s capital have been taken down in recent months, but those efforts intensified this week after President Donald Trump deployed members of the National Guard to address what he said was a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.” On Thursday, a homeless encampment near the Kennedy Center — for which Trump serves as chairman — was dismantled by city workers who shoved people’s belongings into garbage trucks. has been declining in the long run, but has fluctuated in recent years The latest city numbers show that as of 2025, about 5,000 people are in shelters or on the streets of D.C., a decrease of 9% from 2024. The figures show a significant drop over the last decade in D.C.; in 2016, more than 8,000 people were unhoused, though there have been fluctuations over recent years, in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “They live in neighborhoods where the housing is not in very good condition.” People who become homeless are either evicted or forced out of their homes and then stay with friends and family. Donald Whitehead Jr., the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, attributes the drop in homelessness in the city this year to supportive housing and targeting homeless youth in the region. There has been a lot of work around making sure people were protected within the system.” Rachel Pierre, Interim Director of the Department of Health, speaks to a homeless woman outside of the Martin Luther King Jr. We know that when there is a lot of conversation about people experiencing homelessness in a negative way, we see the increase of violence against that population.” While encampment sweeps are nothing new to Washington, those efforts increased in March. “We promote Housing First in the district, because when people have a place — a stable place to stay — then it’s easier for them to receive the services that are available,” she said.

Article: Glacial outburst flooding — caused when natural dams of ice or sediment collapse and send a rush of floodwater downstream — are also a problem in Europe, Central Asia and South America, where they have historically been more deadly. To mitigate risk this year, the city of Juneau lined up miles of barriers along the river, which kept water from seeping into many neighborhoods, even though floodwaters crested higher. “We’re still evaluating the barriers, but we are confident they did help prevent property damage in comparison to the 2024 event,” said Nahaku McFadden, a public affairs chief for the U.S. And because that water is warmer, it starts a positive feedback cycle and thermally erodes the ice,” said Denny Capps, a geomorphologist who leads the national geohazards program at the National Park Service and has studied the phenomenon. That happened again in 2024.” In Alaska, research suggests glacial outbursts have declined in volume since 1985, because glaciers are storing less water behind ice dams that are growing progressively shorter and thinner.

Article: Gavin Newsom, Democratic lawmakers and their allies on Thursday launched a special election campaign to ask California voters to approve new congressional districts to decrease the size of the state’s Republican delegation — a move that could determine control of Congress next year and stymie President Trump’s agenda. Newsom, speaking to a fired-up partisan crowd at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles, said the effort by Republicans represented a desperate effort by a failed president to hold on to power by keeping Congress under Republican control. Pete Aguilar (D-San Bernardino), the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, and union leaders essential to providing the funding and volunteers to convince Californians to vote for the “Election Rigging Response Act.” The ballot measure would temporarily toss out the congressional districts enacted by the state’s voter-approved independent redistricting commission. We are ready to do whatever it takes to stop this power grab and fight back against any and all attacks on our democracy, on our students and on public education,” said Erika Jones, secretary-treasurer of the California Teachers Assn., which represents 310,000 public school teachers. He wants to stack the deck to keep slashing public services to pad the pockets of his billionaire donors.” Advertisement Outside the political rally, Border Patrol agents gathered and arrested at least one person. For Newsom’s plant to work, the Democratic-led state Legislature must vote in favor of placing the measure on the ballot in a special election in November, and then the final decision will be up to California voters. Instead, we should push other states to adopt our independent, nonpartisan commission model across the country,” said Amy Thoma, spokesperson for the Voters First Coalition, which includes Charles Munger Jr., the son of a billionaire who bankrolled the ballot measure that created the independent commission. The commission is not allowed to consider the partisan makeup of the districts, nor protecting incumbents, but instead looks at “communities of interest,” logical geographical boundaries and the Voting Rights Act. Sara Sadhwani, who served on the redistricting commission that approved the current congressional district boundaries, said that while she is deeply proud of the work she and her colleagues completed, she approved of Newsom’s effort to temporarily put the commission’s work aside because of the unprecedented threats to American democracy. “These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,” said Sadhwani, citing the immigration raids, the encouragement of political violence and the use of National Guard troops in American cities. These are the hallmarks of a democracy in peril.” Advertisement If voters approved the ballot measure, the new maps would be in effect until the independent commission redraws the congressional boundaries in 2031.

Article: Democrats who so far have halted a vote by leaving the state announced Thursday that they will return home if state Republicans end their current special session and California releases its own redrawn map proposal. The move is a direct response to a Republican-led effort in Texas, pushed by President Donald Trump as his party seeks to maintain its slim House majority after the midterm elections. Democrats signaled that they plan to make the campaign about more than maps, tying it explicitly to the fate of American democracy and as an opportunity for voters to reject Trump’s policies. “Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,” Newsom, who is seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, said at a news conference with other Democrats. WATCH: Newsom holds Q&A on California’s response to Trump’s redistricting plan in Texas The Thursday announcement marks the first time any state beyond Texas is officially wading into the mid-decade redistricting fight, kicking off a national standoff that could spill into more states. In Missouri, a document obtained by The Associated Press shows the state Senate received a $46,000 invoice to activate six redistricting software licenses and provide training for up to 10 staff members Newsom encouraged other Democratic-led states to get involved. “Gavin Newsom’s latest stunt has nothing to do with Californians and everything to do with consolidating radical Democrat power, silencing California voters, and propping up his pathetic 2028 presidential pipe dream,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Christian Martinez said in a statement. “Newsom’s made it clear: he’ll shred California’s Constitution and trample over democracy — running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority.” California Democrats already hold 43 of the state’s 52 House seats, and the state has some of the most competitive House seats.

Article: This is essential to your recovery.’” But after 11 days in a hospital bed with no word on when he’d be transferred to the facility, Karadell said he learned his health insurer, Aetna, had denied coverage for what’s known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation. What followed was a weekslong back-and-forth between Aetna and the hospital, University Hospital in Ann Arbor — including phone calls, bureaucratic delays and miscommunication, according to a Michigan Medicine spokesperson, an Aetna spokesperson and hospital case notes reviewed by NBC News. Courtesy Emily Steiner In a statement, an Aetna spokesperson said the circumstances surrounding Karadell’s denied claim are “complex” and the insurer’s ability to process claims and appeals is “dependent on the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the information we receive from the provider.” “We understand the frustration whenever there is a health care process that is complicated or does not meet a member’s expectations,” the spokesperson said. “Even though the vast majority of experiences are managed smoothly, our company strives to partner with healthcare providers to make sure each member receives what’s expected every time.” The spokesperson added, “as we are not in the hospital with this patient, we expect our providers to partner with us and play an active role in conveying important clinical information to us that we would not otherwise have.” Karadell’s experience, however, is far from unique: A nationwide survey of more than 1,300 insured adults found over a third — 36% — had had at least one claim denial, said Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor in the department of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh who conducted the survey. “And it’s really overwhelming, especially because when we’re navigating these things, it’s not on our best day, it’s on our worst.” ‘Discharge has been delayed’ Some form of rehab is recommended for all patients after a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association. The program recommended for Karadell — known as acute post-stroke rehabilitation — is typically for patients who still have significant difficulties, such as trouble walking, feeding themselves or bathing but are medically stable enough to tolerate therapy, said Dr. In a hospital note dated June 8, 2024, two days after he was admitted, Karadell was described as still having significant difficulty getting dressed, bathing, brushing his teeth and using the bathroom on his own. “Progressing well in therapy, will greatly benefit from multidisciplinary rehab at IPR [inpatient post-acute rehabilitation] to facilitate maximal independence in ADLs [activities of daily living] and functional mobility prior to return home,” the note said. (In Karadell’s case, his wife said, it also took a mental toll, as he had trouble sleeping due to noise and patients sharing the room.) Ifejika said she typically starts patients in rehab within two to three days of a stroke. An Aetna spokesperson said the hospital’s appeal was not submitted as “expedited.” That same day, a hospital note said that Karadell was “significantly below baseline of function,” adding: “Recommend IPR to progress independence in ADLs.” In a second note also dated June 17, a doctor wrote: “Today, discussed with patient will continue to work on IPR admission. Two days later, on June 26, a hospital note said: “He and wife continue to voice their frustration regarding the insurance-related delays.” In the days that followed, the hospital said Aetna denied the approval for a second time. Subacute care On June 30, nearly 30 days after Karadell’s stroke, Aetna said it approved the intensive rehab, but the hospital spokesperson said they didn’t receive the approval until July 5, a Friday. At that point, Karadell gave up and opted to get less intensive rehab closer to home — an option that his care team had been considering as a backup and had already been authorized. (Aetna said it had canceled the intensive rehab approval because of the hospital’s request to send Karadell to a less-intensive program, as the two requests were mutually exclusive.) Ifejika said that so-called subacute care, which is often provided at an outside facility, such as a nursing home or assisted living facility, is easier to get insurance approval for because it’s less expensive. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said more fundamental reform, likely from Congress, will be needed to address the health care barriers imposed by insurance companies.

Article: CANADA, — Summer travelers are facing uncertainty as the clock winds down on a possible strike by Air Canada flight attendants, which the airline said would force it to cancel almost all of its scheduled flights as soon as Saturday. Air Canada said it was suspending its schedule and trying to get passengers booked with other airlines to limit disruptions if members of its cabin crews walk off the job. Here’s what to know about the rights of passengers and airline consumer protections: Impacted passengers will be notified Air Canada said it would reach out via email or text to let customers know if their flights are canceled. If the walkout happens, the airline said it would suspend all of its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights, but not the regional Air Canada Express flights operated by Jazz Aviation and PAL Airlines. Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr said the decision to lock out the union members even if it meant halting flights would help facilitate an orderly restart, “which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete.” A complete grounding would affect 25,000 Canadians a day who traveled abroad and may become stranded. You have options if your flight is canceled Passengers whose travel is impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Passengers with the flexibility to reschedule their travel plans can also rebook their flights for dates between Aug. Most of the union voted to strike Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. Negotiations break down over pay Both the union and the airline say they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. Vancouver-based flight attendant Henly Larden, who has worked for Air Canada since 2017, said the union also won't back down on its goal to get flight attendants paid for the time they're on the ground.

Article: wholesale inflation surged unexpectedly last month, signaling that President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports are pushing costs up and that higher prices for consumers may be on the way. The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index - which measures inflation before it hits consumers- rose 0.9% last month from June, biggest jump in more than three years. "It will only be a matter of time before producers pass their higher tariff-related costs onto the backs of inflation-weary consumers," wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at fwdbonds, a financial markets research firm. Economist Stephen Brown at Capital Economics found the increase "to put it lightly, counterintuitive given the anecdotal evidence that firms are absorbing the lion's share of tariff increases in margins.'' Trump's tariffs have generated considerable uncertainty about the U.S. The wholesale inflation report two days after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 2.7% last month from July 2024, same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Trump then nominated a partisan idealogue to replace her, raising fears of political interference in economic data that investors, policymakers, businesses and the Federal Reserve rely on to make decisions. After an ominous July jobs report - which also showed that hiring was much weaker than originally reported in May and June - the central bank was widely expected to cut interest rates at its meeting next month in a bid to recharge hiring. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge - the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.

Article: One week in, and startups like Cursor, Vercel, and Factory say they've already made GPT-5 the default model in certain key products and tools, touting its faster setup, better results on complex tasks, and a lower price. Behind the scenes, OpenAI has built out its own enterprise sales team — more than 500 people under COO Brad Lightcap — operating independently of Microsoft , which has been the startup's lead investor and key cloud partner. Winning over enterprise GPT-5 is significantly cheaper than Anthropic's top-end Claude Opus 4.1 — by a factor of seven and a half, in some cases — but OpenAI is spending huge amounts on infrastructure to sustain that edge. The company's co-founder and CEO Michael Truell underscored the change during OpenAI's launch livestream, describing GPT-5 as "the smartest coding model we've ever tried." watch now Truell said the change applies only to new sign-ups, as existing Cursor customers will continue using Anthropic as their default model. As of June, enterprise makes up about 80% of its revenue, with annualized revenue growing 17x year-over-year, said a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity in order to discuss company data. The company added $3 billion in revenue in just the past six months — including $1 billion in June alone — and has already signed triple the number of eight- and nine-figure deals this year compared to all of 2024, the person said. GPT-5 API usage has surged since launch, with the model now processing more than twice as much coding and agent-building work, and reasoning use cases jumping more than eightfold, said a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity in order to discuss company data. AI-powered coding platform Qodo recently tested GPT-5 against top-tier models including Gemini 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok 4, and said in a blog post that it led in catching coding mistakes. Vercel, a cloud platform for web applications, has made GPT-5 the default in its new open-source "vibe coding" platform — a system that turns plain-English prompts into live, working apps. JetBrains has adopted GPT-5 as the default in its AI Assistant and in Kineto, a new no-code tool for building websites and apps, after finding it could generate simple, single-purpose tools more quickly from user prompts. "It's a lot better at planning and having coherence over its plan over a long period of time." Grinberg added that GPT-5 integrates well with their multi-agent platform: "It just plays very nicely with a lot of these high-level details that we're managing at the same time as the low-level implementation details." watch now Pricing flexibility was a major factor in Factory's decision to default to GPT-5, as well. Anton Osika, co-founder and CEO of Lovable, a company that builds an AI-powered tool that lets anyone create real software businesses without writing a single line of code, said his team was beta testing GPT-5 for weeks before it officially launched and was "super happy" with the improvement. It's smarter in many complex use cases," Osika said, adding that the new model is "more prone to take actions and reflect on the action it takes" and "spends more time to make sure it really gets it right." Box 's Levie said the biggest gains for him showed up in enterprise workflows that have nothing to do with writing code. His team has been testing the model for weeks on complex, real-world business data — from hundred-page lease agreements to product roadmaps — and found that it excelled at problems that tripped up earlier AI systems. Levie added that for corporate use, where AI agents run in the background to execute tasks, those step-change improvements are critical, and can turn GPT-5 into a real breakthrough for work automation.

Article: California Governor Gavin Newsom has said that the country’s most populous state will promote a partisan redistricting scheme aimed at countering controversial Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas ahead of the United States’ 2026 midterm elections. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Newsom took a combative stance against US President Donald Trump and said that Democrats must respond to what he said were conservative efforts to politicise the electoral process. Newsom and Trump have frequently sparred as the US president seeks to exert pressure on Democrat-led states that have pushed back against his political agenda on issues such as immigration enforcement. Trump prompted outrage in California earlier in the year when he deployed the military and National Guard to Los Angeles during a round of aggressive immigration raids, and suggested at the time that Newsom should be arrested. Newsom said that the redistricting scheme, which would favour the Democrats and could net them five additional seats in the 2026 midterm elections, will go before voters in a special election on November 4. Advertisement The California governor said the scheme was a direct response to a similar redistricting effort in the Republican-led state of Texas, which would help secure five additional likely seats for the Republican Party. He stressed that, unlike in Texas, it would be up to California voters to approve or shoot down the new maps, and that they would only go forward if Texas and other states move forward with their own partisan redistricting efforts. On Thursday, the lawmakers moved closer to ending their nearly two-week walkout that has blocked the GOP’s redrawing of US House maps and put them under escalating threats by Republicans back home. The Democrats announced they will return so long as Texas Republicans end a special session and California releases its own redrawn map proposal, both of which were expected to happen on Friday. Newsom’s move underscores calls within the Democratic Party to take a stronger stance against Trump and the Republicans, including moves that violate previously held norms and rules that Democrats say the US right has long since abandoned.

Article: The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were “good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.” Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government’s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal. “It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,” Gallagher wrote. “Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration’s war on education, and today the people won,” said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law. “Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s Office for Civil Rights.

Article: Air Canada starts canceling flights ahead of work stoppage that could impact hundreds of thousands A complete shutdown of the country's largest airline threatens to impact about 130,000 people a day. Nasr said this approach will help facilitate an orderly restart "which under the best circumstances will take a full week to complete." He said a first set of cancellations involving several dozen flights will impact long-haul overseas flights that were due to depart Thursday night. He said customers whose flights are cancelled will be eligible for a full refund, and it has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide alternative travel options "to the extent possible." Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, head of human resources for Air Canada, said their latest offer includes a 38% increase in total compensation including benefits and pensions over four years. Some flight attendants at the airline's news conference on Thursday held up signs that read "Unpaid work won't fly" and "Poverty wages = UnCanadian." Natasha Stea, who represents flight attendants in Montreal for the union, said she thinks the airline is counting on the government to intervene.

Article: Gerry Spence, the buckskinned legal maverick who called himself America’s best trial lawyer and dramatized that claim with a white Stetson, a dazzling courtroom record and a score of books that gunned down his opponents all over again, died on Wednesday at his home in Montecito, Calif. Spence often boasted that he had never lost a criminal case with a jury trial, as either a defense lawyer or a prosecutor, and that he had not lost a civil case since 1969. Several of his notable civil verdicts were overturned on appeal, and in 1969, when he was said to be drinking heavily because of marital troubles, he lost three cases in a row. But in the tradition of Perry Mason, he seemed unbeatable — not only to courtroom foes but also to lawyers who attended his seminars, and to Americans who read his best-selling books and tuned in to his television programs and network commentaries, most notably on the O.J.

Article: “I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be.” In 2022, days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Trump complimented as “genius” Putin’s decision to declare breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent. Five years later, Putin invoked a conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s history to justify his country’s invasion and his administration pushed falsehoods to cover up the war’s toll, earning PolitiFact’s 2022 Lie of the Year designation. Trump called on Russia to ‘find’ Clinton emails, and then said it was a joke In 2016, Trump spoke to a roomful of TV cameras and reporters (including this fact-checker) with a straight face about his then-political opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her use of a private email server while secretary of state. election When talking about the 2016 election, Trump frequently refers to what he calls the “Russia hoax” — what he maintains is a fabricated story about Russia’s involvement in his winning election against Clinton. The committee’s 2020 report concluded that “the Russian government engaged in an aggressive, multi-faceted effort to influence, or attempt to influence, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.” Mueller’s 2019 report cleared the Trump campaign of criminally conspiring with the Kremlin but reaffirmed the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia favored Trump over Clinton, and noted that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit on Election Day from Moscow’s interference. During a joint press conference in 2018 in Helsinki, Putin said, “The Russian state has never interfered … into internal American affairs, including election process.” We rated that Pants on Fire! Five days after Russian tanks crossed Ukraine’s border, the Russian embassy in Canada tweeted a verifiably false denial that any such occupation had occurred: “The Russian army does not occupy Ukrainian territory and takes all measures to preserve the lives and safety of civilians,” the tweet said, parroting earlier statements from Putin. The White House cited a CNN article about inflation and an excerpt in President Joe Biden’s fiscal 2025 budget message that said “the global pandemic and Putin’s illegal war against the people of Ukraine have led to inflation all over the world.” But the war was not the only cause of inflation. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released a report that she said showed that President Barack Obama’s administration had withheld information on the intelligence community’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. 11 that “they say that Obama gave them sheets, and I gave them Javelins.” Trump made similar remarks in 2019 about Obama sending “pillows and sheets.” (Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko had used similar language in 2014, telling Congress, “Blankets and night vision goggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket.”) The Obama administration did not provide lethal military aid that Ukraine asked for in 2014.

Article: Intel’s shares surged more than 7 percent in regular trading and then another 2.6 percent after the bell on Thursday, following Bloomberg News’ initial report of the potential deal, which cited people familiar with the plan. It is unclear what size stake the federal government will take, but Bloomberg reports that the deal will help “shore up” a planned factory in Ohio that has been delayed. “The meeting was a very interesting one,” Trump said on Truth Social on Monday, adding that his cabinet members and Tan are going to spend time together and bring suggestions to him during the next week. Tan has been tasked to undo years of missteps that left Intel struggling to make inroads in the booming AI chip industry dominated by Nvidia, while investment-heavy contract manufacturing ambitions led to heavy losses. Intel’s planned $28bn chip fabrication plants in Ohio have been delayed, with the first unit now slated for completion in 2030 and operations to begin between 2030 and 2031, pushing the timeline back by at least five years. Taking a stake in Intel would mark the latest move by Trump, a Republican, to deepen the government’s involvement in the US chip industry, seen as a vital security interest to the country. Earlier this week, Trump made a deal with Nvidia to pay the US government a cut of its sales in exchange for resuming exports of banned AI chips to China.

Article: After a loss to the Atlanta Braves on June 21, the Miami Marlins were 30-45, in last place in the National League East and 11 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for the third and final wild card spot in the NL. Entering Thursday, the Marlins are 58-62, now in third place in their division and only six games out of a wild card spot with 52 games left in their season. (The Marlins’ payroll is between one-fifth and one-sixth of what the Los Angeles Dodgers are paying their team this year and only $10 million more than the Golden State Warriors will pay Stephen Curry next season in the NBA.) Despite the team’s paltry payroll, Miami outperformed many of the league’s highest spenders during its midseason turnaround. From June 22 through Wednesday, the Marlins went 28-17 — recording more wins in that time frame than the Dodgers, the New York Mets, the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies, the four teams with the highest payrolls in MLB. Stowers ranks eighth among all major leaguers in OPS, and his 3.5 wins above replacement are higher than those of players such as Mookie Betts, Bryce Harper and Rafael Devers. “We’ve been on a steady climb, slow climb, at times, but I think we just got so hyperfocused on what we needed to do to win games,” McCullough said after the Marlins completed a three-game sweep of the Yankees on Aug. The win that day gave Miami a 55-55 record, making them the first team to go from 16 games under .500 to .500 in the same season in more than 10 years, according to MLB.com.

Article: Newsom was set to speak at the Japanese American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles, when Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino, who has been leading the immigration operations in California, arrived in Little Tokyo, flanked by agents in helmets, camouflage, masks and holding guns. “We’re glad to be here, we’re not going anywhere.” Advertisement When the reporter noted that Newsom was nearby, Bovino responded, “I don’t know where he’s at.” Newsom’s office took to X to share that agents were outside, posting: “BORDER PATROL HAS SHOWED UP AT OUR BIG BEAUTIFUL PRESS CONFERENCE! WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!” The apparent raid Thursday, during which one person was detained, comes amid calls from elected officials for an end to renewed immigration operations across the L.A. In a press conference outside of the museum following the operation, Mayor Karen Bass said, “there’s no way this was a coincidence.” “This was widely publicized that the governor and many of our other elected officials were having a press conference to talk about redistricting, and they decided they were going to come and thumb their nose in front of the governor’s face. Advertisement “They’re talking about disorder in Los Angeles,” the mayor said, “and they are the source of the disorder in Los Angeles right now.” In an emailed response, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Bass, “must be misinformed.” “Our law enforcement operations are about enforcing the law — not about Gavin Newsom,” she said. Customs and Border Protection “patrols all areas of Los Angeles every day with over 40 teams on the ground to make LA safe.” Newsom and Democratic allies, including organized labor, were at the Democracy Center at the Japanese American National Museum to announce the launch of a campaign for a ballot measure which, if approved by voters, would redraw the state’s congressional maps to favor Democrats before the 2026 midterms. Fujioka, chair of the Board of Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, was attending the Newsom press conference when federal agents jumped out of SUVs just feet away from him in front of the museum. As a passerby shouted that they were “cowards,” Bovino said “well done.” Advertisement Carlos Franco said he works with Angel, the man who was arrested by federal agents, and said Angel was in Little Tokyo delivering strawberries. “It’s pretty sad, because I’ve got to go to work tomorrow, and Angel isn’t going to be there.” Saying he was shaken by his friend’s apprehension, Franco advised everyone to “be careful in general, whether you’re undocumented or not.” DHS did not immediately respond to questions about the arrest. If you look at the Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong, Chinese, even Japanese communities, they’re being picked up right in court.” Advertisement Speaking with community leaders on L.A.’s Westside early Thursday morning, Bass condemned the continued raids and said she believed they violated the temporary restraining order upheld by the 9th U.S. Coming and going to Home Depot stores, continuing to chase people through parking lots, detaining them for no particular reason under the auspices that they could be criminals, [it] comes down to one thing — and that is racial profiling,” Bass said. The Trump administration last week petitioned the Supreme Court to allow mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on “roving patrols” implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment.

Article: An unusual about-face that played out at the Food and Drug Administration over the last week illustrated the power of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, particularly with its focus on “natural” drugs. As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its “intent to take action” against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications. But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a post on X that the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. When it doesn’t produce enough, it can lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms including unexplained weight gain, tiredness, sensitivity to cold, changes in menstrual cycles and symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to the Mayo Clinic. The pills — which aren’t FDA-approved — are made from dried thyroid glands, usually from pigs, and are sold under brand names like Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, Nature-Thyroid and Natural Thyroid, according to the agency. In the FDA statement warning against the animal-derived drugs, the agency said they may contain impurities that could result in infections and could also contain inconsistent levels of thyroid hormones, another risk for patients. The FDA needs to change course on this one.” Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, wrote: “I found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto’s. Robert Malone — an anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel — called the decision “terrible news — particularly for postmenopausal women.” He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary’s post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash. When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency’s statement last week, which said, “FDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.” Nixon added that the agency “will share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.” It’s unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. ClinicalTrials.gov lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial’s status is currently marked as “unknown.” Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, completed a trial in 2021 comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren’t regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks. The FDA-approved synthetic versions usually replace one of two thyroid hormones: T4, the main hormone the thyroid produces, or T3, the active form of T4 that helps regulate energy and metabolism. If you take too little, if you’re not getting enough, a number of problems can occur too, including mood problems, like depression.” Weintraub, of ​​NYU Langone Health, said that tiny changes in thyroid hormone levels can have a big impact, so it’s important to get the dosage right. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, however, said that it would be unfair for the FDA to “suddenly yank” the animal-derived versions from the market “without dedicated reasons that they are harmful.” Spratt said that the animal-derived pills have been around for decades as a prescribable drug. (Weintraub said the animal-derived drugs were “grandfathered in,” meaning they were already on the market before current FDA standards for safety were put into place.) While Spratt said she prefers to prescribe the FDA-approved synthetic versions, the animal-derived versions offer an option for people who don’t respond well to the synthetic ones. Weintraub said the synthetic versions don’t “necessarily help everyone’s symptoms, but there’s a more precise and safer way of treating that than resorting to a pig or cow thyroids.” He said patients who don’t respond well to T4- or T3-only medications often do better on a combination of the two.

Musalem said Wednesday on CNBC that a cut that large would be “unsupported by the current state of the economy.” Amid unrelenting attacks from Trump and his administration against the FOMC and Chair Jerome Powell, Goolsbee, who was an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said economic indicators should drive monetary policymaking, not politics. “I invite anybody to look at the minutes or read the transcripts of the FOMC — the people on that body take extremely seriously that it is the economy that should drive the decisions.

Article: Gavin Newsom has officially called for a special election on redistricting in retaliation against Texas Republicans, who have moved to redraw their congressional districts and further gerrymander the electoral map at the direction of Donald Trump. 4, will be an ethical litmus test for California voters who must decide if they want to strip their independent redistricting commission of power temporarily in favor of a constitutional amendment to allow the state Legislature to create new maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 election cycles. Newsom was met with loud applause as he began his address on what he deemed “Liberation Day.” Speaking directly to the camera, he said, “Wake up, America, this is a serious moment. Wake up to what’s going on.” Newsom spoke about the need to fight fire with fire and took direct aim at the president: “Donald Trump, you have poked the bear, and we will punch back.” He added, “I know they say, ‘Don’t mess with Texas.’ But don’t mess with the great Golden State.” I know they say, ‘Don’t mess with Texas.’ But don’t mess with the great Golden State. gavin newsom Republican lawmakers in Texas have been met with fierce criticism for acquiescing to the president’s demand to redraw the map to gain an additional five seats — a move that would disenfranchise Democratic voters in the state, particularly communities of color. When asked by the press why they were taking such drastic measures to unfairly tilt the balance of future elections, one Republican Texas House member, Mitch Little, put it simply: “Because we can.” Speaking ahead of Newsom at the press conference were union representatives, local and national lawmakers from the state, and activists who underscored the risks of not taking action. We are ready to do whatever it takes to stop this power grab and fight back against any and all attacks on our democracy, on our students and on public education.” State Assemblymember Isaac Bryan spoke about the 55 Democratic legislators in Texas who fled their state “courageously, patriotically, to break quorum so that their state couldn’t lie, cheat and steal national elections from the American people.” You come after our votes in California, and we will fight you tooth and nail. This is about whether we will let the authoritarian in the White House break our democracy while we sit silent, while we take a high road that doesn’t exist anymore. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took to the podium and called it “a precarious moment in our nation’s history.” Schiff issued a stark warning to Trump and his Republican colleagues: “You come after our votes in California, and we will fight you tooth and nail.” In recent days, Newsom has been trolling the president on social media and poking fun at his mannerisms, with his press office posting on X in all caps: “PRESS CONFERENCE COMING — HOSTED BY AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR, GAVIN NEWSOM.

Article: Citizenship and Immigration Services promoted white supremacist propaganda during an interview with the far-right outlet Breitbart, alleging that the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda comes in response to liberals’ attempts to nefariously alter the demographic makeup of the country for political gain. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow’s comments to Breitbart, an outlet with a history of promoting racist propaganda, advanced the central tenet of the so-called great replacement theory, in which white supremacists allege that liberals — in many cases, Jewish liberals — are attempting to bring nonwhite immigrants into majority-white countries en masse, to try to change a nation’s demographic makeup and help liberals win elections. I mean, their long-term plan, I think we have to assume, was to grant some sort of mass amnesty, make them all citizens, and then spread them out to try to change demographics elsewhere throughout the country.

But President Donald Trump’s call for Texas to redraw the maps to better ensure that Republicans retain control of the House in the 2026 elections has blown the lid off the practice. WATCH: Newsom announces California is moving ahead on response to Texas redistricting The proposed maps, which are expected to be released Friday, are an attempt to counterbalance Texas’ and Trump’s plan to add five Republican seats. Newsom has been outspoken about retaliating if Texas’s redistricting takes effect, telling Trump this week in a letter that the president was “playing with fire.” Unlike Texas, however, California has an independent commission that handles redistricting after the census each decade, which is typically when districts are reshaped to account for population shifts. Missouri Republicans take steps toward redistricting At Trump’s urging and partly in response to California’s threats, Missouri’s Republican majority is preparing for a special session on congressional redistricting A document obtained by The Associated Press shows the state Senate has received a $46,000 invoice for software licenses and staff training for redistricting.

Article: But the research on mandated treatment suggests that it is often ineffective, and his proposal was met with immediate condemnation from experts in homelessness, with several saying the plan evoked the Trump administration’s show of force in Washington, D.C. In July, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal authorities to determine if they could prioritize grants to cities that “enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use.” Earlier this week, shortly before commandeering the Washington police force and mobilizing National Guard troops to fight crime there, he posted to social media that “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.” The mayor’s proposal also called for a new drop-in center in a Bronx neighborhood where The New York Post has been documenting complaints about public drug abuse; a pilot program to reward people with substance abuse disorders who keep to their treatment plans, a practice known as “contingency management”; and funding to provide cellphones to participants in the city’s Relay program, which provides support to people who have been taken to emergency rooms for overdoses. Jasmine Budnella, the drug policy director at Vocal-NY, a group that organizes low-income New Yorkers, said that the involuntary removal of drug users and the mandated treatment were “horrific” proposals, but praised other elements of Mr.

The mayor has argued that he wants each casino bid to be treated fairly and that the Council bill, which rejected zoning changes that were essential to the Bally’s plan, unfairly targeted one project.

The group, the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines, was created after Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, the same law that established a “vaccine court” to adjudicate claims of injuries caused by immunizations. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement, “By reinstating this Task Force, we are reaffirming our commitment to rigorous science, continuous improvement, and the trust of American families.”

READ MORE: Israeli strike on notorious Evin prison in Tehran killed at least 71 people, Iran’s judiciary says The strikes during visiting hours hit Evin Prison’s main southern entrance, another northern entrance and other areas of the complex, destroying buildings that had medical facilities and prison wards. Human Rights Watch said the attack was “unlawfully indiscriminate” and that there was no evidence of an advance warning or a military target before striking the prison complex, which it estimates holds over 1,500 prisoners. “To make matters worse, Israeli forces put at grave risk prisoners who were already victims of Iranian authorities’ brutal repression,” said Michael Page, the rights group’s deputy Middle East director. “Iranian authorities should not use Israel’s strikes on Evin prison as another opportunity to subject prisoners, including those who should never have been in prison in the first place, to ill-treatment,” said Page.

Article: In response to the walkout anticipated for early Saturday, Air Canada has announced its own “lockout”, a strategy that prevents employees from coming into work in order to force them to the negotiating table. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said its negotiators are unhappy with Air Canada’s proposed wage hikes and other compensation terms, and they have therefore turned down an offer to move the contract discussions into arbitration. “For the past nine months, we have put forward solid, data-driven proposals on wages and unpaid work, all rooted in fairness and industry standards,” said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada component of CUPE, in a statement. “Air Canada’s response to our proposals makes one thing clear: they are not interested in resolving these critical issues.” According to the union, the airline declined to raise flight attendant pay to meet industry standards, keep pace with inflation or match the federal minimum wage.

Instead, it explained that the flight attendants suffered a 9-percent cut in their last contract, meaning that an 8-percent increase over the first year of the new deal is inadequate to recoup the costs. The union also argues that Air Canada does not currently offer “ground pay”, an industry term that describes compensation given for all the services provided before a plane’s doors close. “It averages about 35 hours a month that we are at work not paid.” The union said that it is seeking full pay for all hours worked, along with cost-of-living increases. Ground pay, also called “boarding pay”, has been a key issue in negotiations at US airlines as well, since many carriers do not compensate flight attendants at their hourly rate during crucial periods before or after the flight.

In June, Kennedy fired members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — medical and public health experts who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines — and replaced them with well-known vaccine skeptics or critics of Covid vaccines. The new committee chair, Martin Kulldorff, said the committee will form two work groups, one to scrutinize the childhood vaccination schedule and another to re-evaluate vaccines that haven’t been reviewed in more than seven years. The Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines was formed in 1986 as part of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which aimed to compensate the small number of children who had adverse reactions to vaccines and address growing threats of litigation over vaccine injuries. The task force will work closely with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, which provides recommendations to the HHS secretary about how to implement a national compensation program for childhood vaccine injuries. Hotez said it’s unclear why Kennedy would revive a task force on childhood vaccine safety, given that the current system has a proven track record of picking up on rare adverse events.

Article: How Trump and Putin's past meetings went - and what to expect this time 20 minutes ago Share Save James FitzGerald BBC News Share Save Getty Images The pair donned matching outfits for a "family photo" of leaders in Vietnam in 2017 US President Donald Trump's summit with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Friday is a blockbuster moment in world politics that calls to mind several memorable previous meetings. In the years to come, the duo went on to express their mutual admiration - although Trump recently told the BBC he was "disappointed" with Putin over the bloodshed in Ukraine. Getty Images Putin was pictured in close conversation with Trump at a second meeting in 2017 Trump and Putin again came face-to-face once more in 2017, at an economic forum in Vietnam. Trump will be familiar with Putin's ability to dominate conversations with lengthy, quickly spoken monologues that give his conversant few opportunities to respond, according to diplomats who described the Russian leader's style to the BBC. "Who is in control of the timing, the substance, the agenda, the tone - the point is that you never quite know what you're going to get." As a result, Sir Laurie said, "the interpreters can find it hard to keep up", and it was vital from Trump's perspective that he brought one of his own. It's totally lost in translation." Getty Images Putin puts the ball in Trump's court during a meeting in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018 Perhaps the most overt public display of friendliness between Trump and Putin came when they met for closed-door talks in Helsinki, Finland, in July 2018. Sir Tony recalled Putin showing "Russian old-world courtesy" during meetings in which he was present in the mid-2000s, although "there was always a degree of reserve underneath it, and he was never a very spontaneous character". He added: "The footballs and the smiles, the jokes and that sort of stuff… he's not naturally a 'hail fellow well met' guy, but he does work at it when he thinks it's important for the relationship." Getty Images The pair's most recent meeting was in Japan in 2019 The pair met for further G20 summits in Argentina, in November 2018, and in Japan in June 2019. Of Putin, he said: "I've never seen him any way other than being prepared, very calm, very reasonable in his presentation, and I think that's part of his KGB training." By contrast, Bolton said, Trump's approach to private meetings was similar to his press conferences in public, in that he was prone to freewheeling statements that could surprise even his own aides. I'm sure they're preparing briefing materials as we always did, and he won't read them." Trump believed that a healthy personal relationship with another leader would mean a healthy state-to-state relationship, Bolton said - and Putin knew this.

Musalem said Wednesday on CNBC that a cut that large would be "unsupported by the current state of the economy."

We stand with LULAC Council 4568 and LWV Tarrant County to end racially discriminatory maps that disenfranchise Tarrant County’s Black and Latino voters.” League of Women Voters of Tarrant County President Janet Mattern said the precinct map adopted by Tarrant County commissioners on June 3 dilutes the power of minority residents over the community's objections.

Article: Disney has almost a century of experience of producing animated films, dating back to 1937's "Snow White." Since then, the studio has produced hits that many kids would be familiar with. Think "Cinderella," "Alice in Wonderland" and "Sleeping Beauty." Add to that Pixar's "Toy Story," "The Incredibles" and "Inside Out" and it's not hard to see that Hastings had his work cut out for him. And then came the massively popular "Frozen," the animated musical that was not only the highest-grossing animated film of all time from 2013 to 2019, but whose merchandise and songs were in every toy store, Disney theme park, and car media system when the kids wanted their 30th replay of "Let it Go." But now, Hastings — now Netflix executive chairman — may finally have his goal in sight. On Tuesday, the song "Golden" from the film topped the Billboard Hot 100 , the ninth song associated with K-pop to conquer the Hot 100 — and the first by female lead vocalists, according to Billboard. Statistics that Spotify provided to CNBC revealed that the movie's soundtrack has counted over 46 million monthly listeners as of Tuesday, and the album has topped Spotify's Weekly Top Albums Global Chart for every full week since its release, barring a dip to No. "KPop Demon Hunters" was released with a single trailer, a far cry in terms of marketing compared with "Squid Game 3," which was out a week later and had a slew of publicity events, social media marketing, and even live appearances from the actors promoting the series. It's a rich cultural experience built around sound, storytelling, performance and deep artist-fan connections." "That's exactly what K-Pop Demon Hunters captures, and it's why both the film and its music have resonated so strongly with global audiences," he added. Bernie Cho, president of South Korean artist services agency DFSB Kollective, explained that while the film did not have much marketing on traditional media, it was gaining popularity on social media. "It's not just being listened to, it's being lived." "K-pop Demon Hunters was art imitating life that was imitating art," Cho quipped, referencing the plot point of how Huntr/x — the K-pop group in the movie — draw their power to seal demons from their fans. Director Maggie Kang had said the K-pop groups in the movie were inspired by a multitude of artists, and Cho said, "You have K-pop artists that inspired the movie, now reinterpreting their favorite parts, their favorite scenes, their favorite dance moves, their favorite tracks."

An exclusive report from The Wrap on July 31 revealed that Netflix has more plans, and is considering two sequels, a short film and a stage musical for the franchise. It is important to develop he emotional ties an audience has with a piece of IP, Katz said, "because the more emotionally invested they are in a franchise, the greater the likelihood that they'll spend money on it." "KPop Demon Hunters" has been Netflix's "biggest home run" in original animated movie-making, Katz said. The way Netflix responds to this phenomenon — such as how it crafts a long-lasting franchise across multiple distribution pathways and how it captures consumer spending — will be critical to maximizing the potential of the film, he added.

Article: mortgage fell this week to its lowest level in nearly 10 months, giving prospective homebuyers a sorely needed boost in purchasing power that could help inject life into a stagnant housing market. A Fed rate cut could give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also fuel inflation just as President Trump’s tariff policies risk raising prices for U.S. While trends like declining home listing prices and more properties on the market in the Sunbelt and West now favor buyers, affordability remains a major hurdle for many aspiring homeowners. “Homebuyers who have been relegated to the sidelines by high financing costs got some encouragement in the past two weeks, but it remains to be seen if it’s enough to get more of them back in the game,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.

Article: Personally, as a Democrat, I would like to see us address the issues around public health, around public education, and of course, the flooding that has occurred in Central Texas. But Governor Abbott and Texas Republicans have made it clear the only reason they wanted us there in July was to try to steal five congressional seats and effectively determine the outcome of the election before anybody went to vote. And so what we have asked for as Democrats is not only to stop that effort, but to raise the national awareness around what Governor Abbott and Trump are attempting to do. And I am grateful to see that, today, Governor Newsom has indicated that they are going to go to the people of the state of California and ask if they are willing to vote to effectively say what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If Texas wants to take this extraordinary step of mid-decade redistricting, which really violates the spirit of the Texas Constitution, then California will match that energy and effectively fight fire with fire.

Article: Jeremy Bowen: Netanyahu is presiding over a divided Israel - the old fault lines are now chasms 12 minutes ago Share Save Jeremy Bowen • @BowenBBC International Editor Share Save BBC Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister and by far the dominant force in its politics, has not budged from what he believes is the essential truth about the war in Gaza. He stated it clearly when he ordered the first big ground offensive of the war into the Gaza Strip on 28 October 2023, three weeks after the attacks, and since then he has repeated the themes many times. In this war we will stand steadfast, more united than ever, certain in the justice of our cause." His speech adopted the cadences of Winston Churchill's rallying call in June 1940 of "we shall fight on the beaches," after Britain's defeat by Germany in northern France and the evacuation of more than 338,000 allied soldiers from Dunkirk. Walter Stonema n via Getty / ABIR SULTAN /AFP via Getty Netanyahu has returned to the same themes of light, darkness, good and evil many times since that speech, which adopted the cadences of Winston Churchill's rallying call of 1940 Before Churchill told the British in his celebrated peroration that "we shall never surrender," he had not spared them from the truth that they had suffered a "colossal military disaster". Hamas inflicted Israel's worst defeat in a single day on 7 October, and the horror that it could break open the borders, and kill and take so many hostages, is still very real in Israel. Very few Israelis have ever doubted that their cause is just, but Netanyahu's statement that they would be "more united than ever" could not have been further from the condition of Israel almost two years later. Israel is as divided now as at any time in its history, and Netanyahu, a deeply divisive figure when Hamas attacked, is presiding over fault lines in Israel that have opened into chasms. Israeli views on the suffering in Gaza On the edge of the anti-Netanyahu demonstration in Tel Aviv, several hundred Israelis stood silently, each holding a placard with the name of a Palestinian child killed by Israel in Gaza. The silent demonstrations to stop the killing are getting bigger - some are held outside airbases, where they try to catch the eye of pilots arriving for bombing raids into Gaza - but the demonstrators still hold a minority view. MOHAMMED SABER/EPA/Shutterstock Opinion polls suggest that a large majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering in Gaza "On the street, we're getting a lot of good reactions, like people saying, 'thank you'. "They can't understand how the basic idea of criticising the state is something that is rooted in democracy." Opinion polls taken since the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) went back to war in Gaza in March, breaking the last ceasefire, suggest that a large majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering in Gaza. A sample recorded in the last three days of July by the Israeli Democracy Institute says that 78% of Jewish Israelis, who make up four-fifths of the population, believe that given the restrictions of the fighting, Israel "is making substantial efforts to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to Palestinians in Gaza". The pollsters also chose a more personal question, asking whether individuals were "troubled or not troubled by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza?" Some 79% of Jewish Israelis surveyed said they were not troubled. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/Pool Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has said: 'The only ones that are being starved in Gaza are our hostages' Netanyahu, his ministers and spokespeople insist that Hamas, the United Nations, witnesses, aid workers and foreign governments are telling lies about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Accounts of hunger, and IDF soldiers killing Palestinians struggling to find food that have been believed and condemned by Israel's allies, including Britain, France and Germany, should he said be viewed in the context of the long history of the persecution of Jews in Europe. "Today the Jewish state is being maligned in a similar way." 'We are in a trauma time - hostages are dying' Ms Peretz blames the Israeli media for not showing the suffering and deaths of Palestinians. That subject went closer to the heart of the national conversation when it was raised on a popular Saturday evening television talk show hosted by Eyal Berkovic, the former West Ham United football player. [Many are] begging the government to find a way and make a hostage deal," says Ms Elbaz-Phelps "I just [said] that the war is also killing a lot of Palestinians in Gaza, which is a very simple statement, no political point of view. "But I think there is a huge difference when you talk about something and when you show something, and you will see images of Gaza from above that mainly are going to show the people how IDF is winning the war on the ground. "You don't have human stories, you don't have faces… because Israelis are in pain, and the stories also are happening inside of Israel." Leon Neal/Getty Images 'The pain of the Israeli public [about] 7 October is not completely grasped outside of Israel,' says one journalist Ms Elbaz-Phelps believes the reason is that Israelis are still dealing with their trauma, after 7 October. The pain of the Israeli public, how much they're still on 7 October, is something that is not completely grasped outside of Israel." Too hard to cope with Around 20 Israeli hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza. I met the pollster Dahlia Scheindlin, who has often criticised Netanyahu's conduct of the war in her column in the liberal daily newspaper Haaretz, in "hostage square" next to Israel's military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Speaking about the lack of concern in Israel for the people in Gaza, she tells me: "It's because a large portion of Israelis believe that the suffering has been exaggerated or even partly fabricated by Hamas." ABIR SULTAN/EPA/Shutterstock 'The reason why the majority of Israelis consistently support ending the war is to get the hostages back,' says pollster Dahlia Scheindlin Israelis, she continues, are inclined to believe that the problem is the messaging. "They are too consumed with the hostages or their own family members who are fighting in Gaza, and they just can't handle the sense that Israel might be doing something wrong." 'It's very easy to judge…' Outside the secular Israeli mainstream of Tel Aviv and the cities on the Mediterranean coast, I have found few doubts about the justice of Israel's conduct of the war. Aaron Katzoff, a father of seven who is originally from Los Angeles, has created a winery and a bar called "Settlers," which feels like a small piece of the American west. Settlers Bar is popular with right-wing and religiously-observant people, as well as the local community It is a social centre, not just for his community but for an overwhelmingly right-wing and religiously-observant clientele who make special journeys there. "See what it means not to have oxygen and in the humidity and heat try to fight terrorists that are hiding behind women and children and shoot at you… "It's very easy to sit in an air conditioning room and judge people who do that, war is not easy." REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun What, I asked him, about ending the war now, as so many Israelis want. "Things take time, and it's sad, but that's reality." A 'collapse of support' before 7 October In the months leading up to 7 October 2023, thousands of Israelis had been demonstrating in the streets against plans to change the judicial system in what they saw as an assault on democracy. "Once the war began, by contrast to most other countries where you see a rallying of support for the government, there was a complete collapse of support." ABIR SULTAN/Pool via REUTERS Netanyahu says the war cannot end until there is total victory over Hamas Enough of Netanyahu's political base on Israel's right wing accepts his insistence that the war cannot end until total victory over Hamas, for him to have rebuilt his poll ratings from rock bottom. Ultranationalists in his coalition, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and the national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have threatened to topple his government if he makes any kind of deal with Hamas. Hostages and Missing Families Forum Hostage's families have appealed to Netanyahu to do a deal with Hamas They want not just the defeat of Hamas, but the annexation of Gaza, the removal of Palestinians and their replacement by Jewish settlers. Its chief of staff General Eyal Zamir made it known that he opposes the Netanyahu plan for a new offensive in Gaza, reportedly telling the cabinet that it would endanger the hostages and worsen the humanitarian crisis. Israel Defense Forces (IDF)/Anadolu via Getty Images General Eyal Zamir made it known that he opposes the Netanyahu plan for a new offensive in Gaza Zamir was appointed in March when his predecessor resigned after falling out with the prime minister over the conduct of the war. Some see an opening granted by God to transform Israel into a state ruled by the Torah, the law of God as revealed to Moses and laid out in the five books of the Hebrew scriptures. But for some in Israel's hardline religious nationalist right wing, it is also an opportunity.' (Pictured: Palestinians climb on an Israeli tank on 7 October) War also can speed up their desire to change the map. No space can be allowed for the shrinking number of Palestinians who still believe it might be possible to make peace with Israel by creating an independent state in Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Amir Levy/Getty Images Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich laid out his vision for Gaza and the West Bank earlier this year On 6 May Smotrich laid out his vision for Gaza and the West Bank, which Palestinians want for a state. Most western governments, including the United Kingdom, see Palestinian statehood alongside Israel as the only way to escape a conflict that has lasted more than a century for control of the land Arabs and Jews both want. Palestinians in Gaza would be "totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places". Tension in the old city In the occupied old city of Jerusalem on Sunday 3 August, many Palestinians shut shops and businesses and stayed off the streets as Israeli Jews marked Tisha B'Av. The area where the Temples stood later became the third holiest place for Muslims, now dominated by al-Aqsa mosque where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ended his night journey from Mecca, and the golden rotunda of the Dome of the Rock where he ascended to heaven. Getty Images Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is an important religious site for Muslims To try to keep the peace in an area that is a religious and national symbol for Israelis and Palestinians, a set of laws and customs, known as the status quo, is supposed to be observed. Dozens of his followers – and heavily armed police that he commands as national security minister – followed as he strode through the narrow street of the Old City, through the gates of the place Israelis call the Temple Mount. announce sovereignty of the whole of Gaza Strip' As well as praying, he made a speech linking his presence and prayers in Jerusalem to the war in Gaza and the way he wants to change Israel. "From Temple Mount - the place where we proved that sovereignty and governance can be done - from here of all places we should send a message and make sure that today itself we conquer the whole of Gaza Strip, announce sovereignty of the whole of Gaza Strip, take down every Hamas man and encourage voluntary emigration. "Only this way will we return the hostages and win the war." 'We want our house back' After Ben-Gvir had left, a big crowd of his young religious supporters stayed on to pray in a long, covered arcade. "This is our house for thousands of years, and now we're back here, we want our house." When I asked what would happen to the Muslim holy places that stand there now, they said they didn't know. According to senior diplomatic sources, the nightmare for security services in both Israel and its Arab neighbours is that a violent Jewish extremist might try to damage al-Aqsa mosque to bring on the third temple, an act that would risk igniting the region. 'We are torn from inside' On the other end of the political spectrum is Avrum Burg, a writer and strong critic of Netanyahu, who used to be one of Israel's most prominent centre-left politicians. At one, on a hot and humid night in Tel Aviv, secular opponents of the government waved the blue and white Star of David flag, chanted and banged drums until they stood silent for the national anthem. "We wish to replace Netanyahu's government, but specifically to bring back all hostages in a deal at once, ending Netanyahu's war in Gaza, which at this point has become completely political and serving nothing but his own political survival, of Netanyahu and his partners." JACQUELYN MARTIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images There have been demonstrations calling for Netanyahu's resignation I suggested some might accuse her of repeating the Hamas position. (For more than a year Hamas negotiators have offered to return all the hostages if the IDF pulled out of Gaza and the US and others guaranteed that the Israel would not go back to war once it had its people back. Israel, however, insists that Hamas must be fully disarmed, play no future role in Gaza and that Israel would retain security control in Gaza with the freedom to decide what comes next.) But Ms Rosalio dismissed the suggestion that a ceasefire deal could be any kind of a win for Hamas. "We are torn from inside." In God's hands In the last three weeks I have travelled between the two sides of Israel, from leftists in Tel Aviv silently protesting the killing of Palestinian children, displaying the "psychological despair" described by Avrum Burg, the former speaker of parliament. But on the other side of Israel, I have witnessed an overwhelming sense that Israel should ignore the mounting pressure and condemnation by some of its allies as well as its enemies, a feeling that its actions are justified by everything Hamas did on 7 October and the continued imprisonment of Israeli hostages in brutal conditions in tunnels. REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa Jeremy Bowen travelled between the two sides of Israel - on one side, leftists in Tel Aviv silently protesting the killing of Palestinian children and suffering there Israel's prime minister, still backed in public by US President Donald Trump despite murmurings that he is becoming exasperated by Netanyahu's refusal to make a hostage deal possible, is planning another offensive and accuses Israel's allies of deep seated antisemitism. Deep in the West Bank, overlooking the Jordan Valley, Aaron Katzoff and his friends in the Settlers wine bar believe they are fulfilling the prophecies of the scriptures, as they drink wine from grapes he says proudly were grown using the methods of Biblical times.

Article: Data centres to be expanded across UK as concerns mount 45 minutes ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman & Krystina Shveda • @zsk Technology editor & BBC reporter Share Save Getty Images Data centres, like this one Google is building in Hertfordshire, are becoming a more familiar sight across the UK. Data centres are giant warehouses full of powerful computers used to run digital services from movie streaming to online banking - there are currently an estimated 477 of them in the UK. Construction researchers Barbour have analysed planning documents and say that number is set to jump by almost 100, as the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) increases the need for processing power. While the new data centres are mostly due for completion by 2030, the biggest single one planned would come later - a £10-billion AI data centre in Blyth, near Newcastle, for the American private investment and wealth management company Blackstone Group. Microsoft is planning four new data centres in the UK at a total cost of £330 million, with an estimated completion between 2027 and 2029 - two in the Leeds area, one near Newport in Wales, and a five-storey site in Acton, north west London. It is not known what the energy consumption of the new centres will be as this data is not included in the planning applications, but US data suggests they are can be considerably more powerful than older ones. Dr Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at machine learning firm Hugging Face, explains that in the US "average citizens in places like Ohio are seeing their monthly bills go up by $20 (£15) because of data centres". She said the timeline for the new data centres in the UK was "aggressive" and called for "mechanisms for companies to pay the price for extra energy to power data centres - not consumers". According to the National System Operator, NESO, the projected growth of data centres in Great Britain could "add up to 71 TWh of electricity demand" in the next 25 years, which it says redoubles the need for clean power - such as offshore wind. Stephen Hone, chief executive of industry body the Data Centre Alliance, says "ensuring there is enough water and electricity powering data centres isn't something the industry can solve on its own".

Article: Government turns to TikTokers to advise on cosmetic surgery abroad 1 hour ago Share Save Joe McFadden and Josh Elgin • @Joe_McFaddenBBC Health reporters Share Save Getty Images The government is partnering with TikTok influencers to warn people about the risks of travelling abroad for cosmetic procedures. Medical influencers like Doc Tally and Midwife Marley - who have 240,000 and 38,000 followers on TikTok respectively - will produce videos offering guidance on how to make trips as safe as possible. Health minister Karin Smyth warned that "too many people are being left with life-altering injuries after going abroad for medical procedures, without access to proper advice or safeguards." She said the partnership with TikTok would help people "make safer and more informed choices before they go under the knife – wherever that may be." Things to check before you book: Do thorough research about the procedure Check the clinic's regulation and the surgeon's credentials Know the full cost and understand the aftercare Ask the vital question - if it goes wrong, who will fix it? "I just wanted to cry and I feel like I actually disliked my body more than when I was overweight." Leah found the clinic on social media and was encouraged by other people's positive experiences with similar surgeries. "I didn't think it would ever happen to me." Leah now documents her experience on social media, using her platform to inform others about the risks involved in similar procedures. The clinic which performed Leah's surgery in Turkey could not be reached for comment, but they previously issued a statement saying "plastic surgery isn't straight-forward and unfortunately some health issues or complications cannot be anticipated". Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty said: "If you choose to travel abroad for medical treatment, it is vital you do your research and are fully aware of the risks involved." "We urge anyone considering a medical procedure abroad to review our travel advice, relevant guidance from the NHS and other professional bodies, and research foreign providers thoroughly to ensure they meet the highest standard of care." "Informed choices today can help avoid serious complications tomorrow." Ali Law, TikTok's UK public policy lead, said the platform was "committed" to helping users find "information from trusted sources when searching for topics related to physical and mental health."

Article: 'We were never friends': A massacre on the eve of WW2 still haunts China-Japan relations 3 hours ago Share Save Fan Wang BBC News, in Singapore Share Save STR/AFP via Getty Images Nanjing massacre was the darkest chapter of the years-long Sino-Japanese war Japanese vlogger Hayato Kato's 1.9 million followers are used to his funny clips about exploring China, where he has been living for several years. "I just watched a movie about the Nanjing Massacre," he said, referring to the Japanese army's six-week rampage through Nanjing in late 1937, which, by some estimates, killed more than 300,000 civilians and Chinese soldiers. Already a box office hit, it is the first of a wave of Chinese movies about the horrors of Japanese occupation that are being released to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. Speaking in Chinese on Douyin, China's domestic version of TikTok, Kato recounted scenes from the film: "People were lined up along the river and then the shootings began… A baby, the same age as my daughter, was crying in her mother's arms. A Japanese soldier rushed forward, grabbed her, and smashed her into the ground." He said he had seen many people on the Japanese internet denying the Nanjing Massacre had happened, including public figures, even politicians. We never were." CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Nanjing Photo Studio is the first of several movies this year about the horrors of Japanese occupation For China, Japan's brutal military campaign and occupation are among the darkest chapters of its past – and the massacre in Nanjing, then the capital, an even deeper wound. What has made it fester is the belief that Japan has never fully owned up to its atrocities in places it occupied – not just China, but also Korea, what was then Malaya, Philippines, Indonesia. In his video, Kato seems to acknowledge that it's not a subject of conversation in Japan: "Unfortunately these anti-Japanese war movies are not shown in Japan publicly, and Japanese people are not interested to watch them." When the Japanese Emperor announced on 15 August that he would surrender, his country had already paid a terrible cost – more than 100,000 had been killed in bombing raids on Tokyo, before two atom bombs devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. "While the military war has ended, the history war continues," says Professor Gi-Wook Shin, of Stanford University, explaining the two sides remember those years differently, and those differences add to the tension. While the Chinese see Japanese aggression as a defining, and devastating, moment in their past, Japanese history focuses on its own victimhood - the destruction caused by the atom bombs and post-war recovery. "They see it as something in the past, and the country doesn't really commemorate it - because they also view themselves as victims." He calls himself a patriot, but he says that hasn't made things difficult for him personally because their reluctance to talk about it means they "avoid such sensitive topics". Of course, there are also those who acknowledge that it was, in fact, an invasion." CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images The 1937 Nanjing massacre is commemorated every year across China China fought Japan for eight years, from Manchuria in the north-east to Chongqing in the south-west. Xi even revised the date the war with Japan started – the Chinese government now counts the first incursions into Manchuria in 1931, which makes it a 14-year war, rather than eight years of full-fledged conflict. That is apart from Dongji Rescue, a film inspired by the real-life efforts of Chinese fishermen who saved hundreds of British prisoners of war during Japanese raids; and Mountains and Rivers Bearing Witness, a documentary from a state-owned studio about Chinese resistance. "We are not friends...", the now-famous line from the movie, "is not just a line" between the two main characters, says a popular review that has been liked by more than 10,000 users on Weibo. They've never issued a sincere apology, they are still worshipping [the war criminals], they are rewriting history – no-one will treat them as friends", the comment says, referring to some Japanese right-wing figures' dismissive remarks. For years, in Chinese history classes, students have been shown a photo of former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling before a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1970. GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images In 2015, President Xi began a new tradition of holding military parades to commemorate Japan's surrender When Japan surrendered in 1945, the turbulence in China did not end. For the next three years, the Nationalist Kuomintang – then the ruling government and the main source of Chinese resistance against Japan – fought a civil war against Mao Zedong's Communist Party forces. As Chinese leaders moved away from Mao – and his destructive legacy – the trauma of what happened under Japanese attack became a unifying narrative for the Communist Party, says Yinan He, associate professor of international relations at Lehigh University in the US. And Japan is [an] easy target because that's the most recent external [aggressor]." She describes a "choreographed representation of the past", where commemorations of 1945 often downplay the contributions of the US and the Kuomintang, and are accompanied by growing scrutiny of Japan's official stance on its wartime actions.

"US audiences were able to see a Swedish independent film that otherwise only a very niche audience would have otherwise seen." He says that AMC plans to run more releases like this. "When I worked on Heist in 2014, with a brilliant cast including Robert De Niro, and then I saw that movie translated to a different language, that's when I first realised that no wonder the movies and TV don't travel well, because the old world of dubbing really kind of changes everything about the film," says Mr Mann, now based in Los Angeles. And from a purist filmmaking perspective, a very much lower grade product is being seen by the rest of the world." Flawless Scott Mann founded Flawless in 2020 Flawless developed its own technology for identifying and modifying faces, based on a method first presented in a research paper in 2018. "DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection [such as facial features] and 3D face tracking to understand the actor's appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot," says Mr Mann. As well as giving an actor the appearance of speaking another language, DeepEditor can also transfer a better performance from one take into another, or swap a new line of dialogue, while keep the original performance with its emotional content intact. Thanks to the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple, the global film dubbing market is set to increase from US$4bn (£3bn) in 2024 to $7.6bn by 2033, according to a report by Business Research Insights. "I'd say it works out at about a tenth of the cost of shooting it or changing it any other way." His customers include "pretty much all the really big streamers". "There is an enormous amount of incredible kind of cinema and TV out there that is just never seen by English speaking folks, because many don't want to watch it with dubbing and subtitles," says Mr Mann.

Article: Instagram users angry and confused as Meta overturns yet more account bans 6 minutes ago Share Save Graham Fraser Technology Reporter Share Save Getty Images The banning of accounts has left an emotional impact on people Instagram users have told the BBC of their confusion, fear and anger after having their accounts suspended, often for being wrongly accused by parent company Meta of breaching the platform's child sex abuse rules. More than 500 of them have contacted the BBC to say they have lost cherished photos and seen businesses upended - but some also speak of the profound personal toll it has taken on them, including concerns that the police could become involved. That has left wondering if a picture she posted of herself and her 21-year-old friend wearing bikini tops somehow triggered the artificial intelligence (AI) moderation tools, as she thinks they "look a little bit younger". "Given that I have a desire to work in juvenile justice as an attorney and advocate on behalf of children, I am appalled to have been suspended for something I know I did not do and would never do." She appealed, and then about seven hours after the BBC highlighted Lucia's case to Meta's press office, her account was restored with no explanation.

Article: posted a 2 1/2-minute video to X announcing that the Department of Health and Human Services was canceling some $500 million in mRNA vaccine research via 22 contracts from the department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. While Kennedy was meeting with tribal health leaders and salmon fishing in the Alaska wilderness, scientists and public health experts were condemning the mRNA announcement in a backlash that HHS apparently had not anticipated. And over the next week, what should have been the signature accomplishment of Kennedy’s first year at HHS — the realization of a promise to end vaccines he’s falsely called deadly, even as nearly every major public health, scientific and medical body agrees they are both very safe and have saved millions of lives — became a case study in how not to sell an anti-vaccine policy in Washington. Kennedy’s announcement landed without a communications plan, a fact sheet to explain the decision internally or to the White House, and without experts or agency surrogates ready to explain the decision to the public, according to three current and former HHS officials who were granted anonymity because they were not permitted to speak for the agency. Interviews with HHS officials and MAHA influencers as well as insider accounts shared on alternative media channels reveal how the mRNA scandal unfolded inside the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency plagued by dysfunction in the early months of Trump’s second term as Kennedy chips away at the nation’s public health infrastructure. Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams said that the move would “cost lives.” Rick Bright, the former director of BARDA, the agency that had contracted the canceled research, warned it would “cripple our front-line defense.” Even the Trump-friendly National Review published an editorial with the headline “Don’t Abandon mRNA.” MAHA supporters were vexed, too: Why hadn’t Kennedy gone further, many wondered. 6 how the move squared with Operation Warp Speed — the celebrated initiative that delivered the first Covid vaccines — President Donald Trump replied, “Research on what?” When a reporter clarified the question was about the mRNA vaccines, the president said, “Well, we’re going to look at that. We’re talking about it.” Trump praised Warp Speed as “one of the most incredible things ever done in this country,” then added: “That was now a long time ago, and we’re on to other things. We have meetings about it tomorrow at 12 o’clock.” A White House official declined to comment on the record or confirm whether the meeting occurred, but told MSNBC that Trump had been made aware of and supported HHS’ decision. Key leadership and decision-making roles, typically held by seasoned public health officials, career managers and experienced political appointees, have been filled by anti-vaccine activists, Trump loyalists and fringe doctors and advisers. With Kennedy still in Alaska — accompanied by his ever-present and reportedly unpopular gatekeeper, principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear — the task of damage control fell on Gray Delany, a MAHA true believer with MAGA political bona fides. A devoted staffer from Kennedy’s failed presidential campaign, Delany was hired in June as HHS’ director of MAHA implementation and external affairs, essentially a bridge in the HHS communications shop for the MAHA movement and MAGA media and activists. Anti-vaccine hard-liners were accusing Kennedy of selling out or slow-walking the changes he’d promised on the campaign trail while targeting food dyes and seed oils in moves that the newcomers in the health food contingent wanted but anti-vaxxers thought had little real impact. Delany’s role was as a kind of base-whisperer: coordinating with the small farmers, mom groups, anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, listening to their concerns and informing Kennedy on their pet issues while bringing impatient activists back into the fold. Steven Hatfill, a virologist, former Trump adviser and promoter of ineffective cures during the pandemic who was hired in April as a special adviser to the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Delany drafted a fact sheet to justify the cancellations, booked Hatfill on friendly MAGA shows and worked the phones to rally MAHA supporters. “There’s been a lot of back-and-forth within the movement, especially on the vaccine issue, and I just would hope that we can stay united as a movement because I think there is an active effort to divide us.” The freewheeling public relations response continued through the night. The list — a link to which was also shared with MSNBC by an HHS spokesperson in response to questions about the data underlying the decision — was compiled by Hatfill and several other contributors who criticized health measures and vaccines and touted unproven treatments during the pandemic, including an immunologist at a Canadian veterinary college, a Namibian dentist, a cardiologist whose board certification was revoked last year and a freelance writer. The next day, on Emerald Robinson’s show on LindellTV — a conspiracy theory-driven network founded by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell — Hatfill said the call had been made by his boss, John Knox, deputy assistant secretary of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), and Kennedy. “President Trump and Secretary Kennedy, and it’s my boss, John Knox at ASPR, and everyone went over the data and agreed that this had to be stopped.” But Hatfill and Delany’s defiance had consequences. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email that Delany “is leaving HHS to contribute to the MAHA-MAGA movement from outside the official sector.” By Friday, HHS was still cleaning up the mess and dealing with a new crisis after a man who reportedly believed he had been harmed by a Covid vaccine fired some 500 rounds at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters, killing a police officer and traumatizing thousands of employees. Instead, for the first time, Bhattacharya offered a policy rationale for the decision: “My bottom line is that the technology is promising, but not yet ready for prime time for vaccines.” On Aug. That same day, Alastair Thomson, chief data officer at the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which funds and manages ambitious breakthrough research, announced that he had resigned over HHS’ mRNA decision. In a now-deleted LinkedIn post, Thomson wrote that the vaccines were “demonstrably the most effective and safest vaccines ever produced by humanity.” “I have a mantra: Data is truth,” Thomson told me in a phone interview, explaining that Kennedy’s explanation for his mRNA decision — citing the data — had been a red line. “To say the vaccines aren’t effective or safe is just completely counter to the data.” “If data that I help generate, curate and make available is being used to make bogus decisions, then I’m complicit. None of the explanations were accompanied by any data or the kind of gold-standard scientific assessments Kennedy has said would guide his decisions — an expected outcome for an agency marked by inexperience and led by ideologues who base policy on their false beliefs.

Article: Columbia University signed a deal that included more than $200 million in payment to the government in exchange for the restoration of more than $400 million in grants that were terminated or frozen by the Trump administration. “They must not become a precedent guiding Harvard or other higher educational institutions nationwide.” It added: “Do not give in.” Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is the only university that has directly sued the administration, a move that had been praised by some who saw the elite school as one of the few powerful institutions standing up to the Trump administration’s conservative agenda. But as the school has indicated that it is willing to make a deal with the government, professors have worried that if an influential university like Harvard turns over a large sum of money, it would have a cascading effect on higher education as a whole.

Article: Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is suing Roblox, alleging that the online gaming platform is allowing sexual predators to victimize kids FILE - The gaming platform Roblox is displayed on a tablet, Oct. -- Louisiana sued the online gaming platform Roblox on Thursday, alleging the wildly popular site has perpetuated an environment where sexual predators "thrive, unite, hunt and victimize kids.” The lawsuit, filed in state court by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox has failed to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from adult predators. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety." The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services. Last month, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. Its website describes Roblox as "the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine.” Roblox doesn’t allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information, such as phone numbers. Roblox, which according to its website has “a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors,” doesn’t allow children under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission. The company says on its website that age verification "is a new feature that is currently in testing on Roblox.” Last month, it launched a feature that requires teenagers aged 13 to 17 to send a video selfie to verify their ages if they want to chat freely with people they know, called “trusted connections.” Amid mounting criticism in recent months, the company has implemented additional measures that it says will keep their young users safe. Roblox said the system led it to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025.

Article: says sexual violence in conflicts worldwide increased by 25% last year, with the highest number of cases in the Central African Republic, Congo, Haiti, Somalia and South Sudan Sexual violence in conflicts worldwide increased by 25% last year, UN says FILE - The UN flag flies on a stormy day at the United Nations during the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) UNITED NATIONS -- Sexual violence in conflicts worldwide increased by 25% last year, with the highest number of cases in the Central African Republic, Congo, Haiti, Somalia and South Sudan, according to a U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ annual report said more than 4,600 people survived sexual violence in 2024, with armed groups carrying out the majority of the abuse but some by government forces. The report’s blacklist names 63 government and non-government parties in a dozen countries suspected of committing or being responsible for rape and other forms of sexual violence in conflict, including Hamas militants, whose attack in Israel on Oct. has “credible information” that could put them on next year’s blacklist if they don't take preventive actions: Israel’s military and security forces over allegations of sexual abuse of Palestinians primarily in prisons and detention, and Russian forces and affiliated armed groups against Ukrainian prisoners of war. In an increasing number of places, the report said armed groups “used sexual violence as a tactic to gain and consolidate control over territory and lucrative natural resources.” Women and girls perceived to be associated with rival armed groups were targeted with sexual violence in the Central African Republic, Congo and Haiti, it said. In detention facilities, the report said sexual violence was perpetrated “including as a form of torture,” reportedly in Israel and the Palestinian territories, Libya, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. In mineral-rich eastern Congo, the peacekeeping mission documented nearly 800 cases last year, including rape, gang rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage, “often accompanied by extreme physical violence,” the report said. In Sudan, where civil war is raging, the report said that groups providing services to victims of sexual violence recorded 221 rape cases against 147 girls and 74 boys since the beginning of 2024, “with 16% of survivors under five years of age, including four one-year-olds.” ___

Article: The Supreme Court has refused for now to block enforcement of a Mississippi law aimed at regulating the use of social media by children By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press and LINDSAY WHITEHURST Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Thursday refused for now to block enforcement of a Mississippi law aimed at regulating the use of social media by children, an issue of growing national concern. NetChoice is challenging laws passed in Mississippi and other states that require social media users to verify their ages, and asked the court to keep the measure on hold while a lawsuit plays out. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that there's a good chance NetChoice will eventually succeed in showing that the law is unconstitutional, but hadn't shown it must be blocked while the lawsuit unfolds. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch told the justices that age verification could help protect young people from “sexual abuse, trafficking, physical violence, sextortion and more,” activities that Fitch noted are not protected by the First Amendment. NetChoice represents some of the country’s most high-profile technology companies, including Google, which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, called the decision "an unfortunate procedural delay.” “Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment — not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits," he said.

Article: Glenn Youngkin said Thursday that Virginia's economy is thriving after ending its fiscal year with high revenues, a characterization Democrats criticized as rose-colored in light of budgetary decisions in neighboring Washington, D.C. In a presentation to the state's money committees, Youngkin and Virginia's secretary of finance said revenues for the fiscal year resulted in a $572 million surplus and a $4.7 billion rainy-day fund. It is the result of very intentional decisions made by all of us — intentional decisions to lift up opportunity in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” Youngkin said in his speech to lawmakers. They’re enabling us to compete and to win.” Democratic lawmakers were quick to push back, particularly in light of looming Medicaid work requirements for some adults after Congress passed a reconciliation bill last month. Youngkin repeatedly said Medicaid will not be taken away from Virginians, and Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings added that hospitals will be able to absorb any additional costs from federal cuts to Medicaid. He added that the CBO, which “America relies upon to tell us the answers to these things, tells us that millions of Americans are going to lose their Medicaid.” Democrats also said the governor is not fully acknowledging that the White House's reshaping of the federal workforce will continue to impact the state's economy. But Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore praised Youngkin's presentation, calling it “the kind of news every Virginian should cheer.” “It happened because Republicans have kept a steady hand on the wheel,” Kilgore said.

Article: Thailand’s army is warning that it may have to“exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines Thailand warns it may act in 'self-defense' after soldier hurt by a mine blast near Cambodian border BANGKOK -- Thailand’s army warned that it may have to “exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia, in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines. Winthai Suvaree said a sergeant was patrolling the border with seven other soldiers Tuesday morning when he ”stepped on an anti-personnel landmine covertly planted by the Cambodian side, resulting in severe injuries to his left ankle.” The incident and the Thai reaction indicates the precariousness of the ceasefire that took effect on July 29 with the aim of ending five days of armed clashes over disputed territory along their border. “This incident serves as clear evidence that the Cambodian side has violated the ceasefire agreement and shows no respect for international humanitarian law, particularly the Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use and placement of all types of anti-personnel landmines,” said the Thai army statement about the latest incident. The statement noted the multiple similar incidents and declared that Thailand “has consistently adhered to peaceful approaches and has not been the initiating party.” “However, should circumstances become compelling, it may be necessary to exercise the right of self-defense under international law principles to resolve situations that cause Thailand to continuously lose personnel due to violations of ceasefire agreements and sovereignty encroachments by Cambodian military forces,” it warned. “Cambodia, as a proud and responsible State Party to the Ottawa Convention, maintains an absolute and uncompromising position: we have never used, produced, or deployed new landmines under any circumstances, and we strictly and fully honor our obligations under international law,” she said, echoing previous official denials. Ly Thuch, senior minister and first vice-president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970, according to an interview with the Cambodian state news agency AKP.

Article: The Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people formed in Colombia in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and from environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining Banners on the side of the road for the Dagoberto Ramos armed group are displayed on July 18, 2025, in Caldono, Colombia. Elago and five fellow members of the Indigenous Guard trekked across mountainous terrain to confront the guerrillas they suspected of taking her son and another teenager to bolster their ranks. “It was a victory.” Rescue missions like Elago's have intensified for the Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people, which formed in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining. Since 2020, as armed groups tightened their control of Nasa territory to expand illicit crops like marijuana and coca, those guerrillas have ramped up their recruitment of the region's children by dangling offers of cash and protection. Over eight days reporting in the Cauca region, the AP spoke to more than 20 young people affected by the recruitment as well as several families grappling with the same threat. Yet more than 40 Guard members have been slain since the peace deal, according to Colombia’s Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), a longstanding organization representing Nasa and other Indigenous communities. “They’ve aimed their rifles at us … pressed them to our chests, to our heads.” Elago said the rebels her group confronted three years ago expressed respect for the Guard but claimed the boys had joined voluntarily, which infuriated her. They met with commanders, only to find the 15- and 16-year-old boys did not want to return and were considered by the armed groups to be old enough to decide for themselves. Colombia’s Family Welfare Institute, or ICBF — the main agency protecting children — told AP it funds community programs and Indigenous‑led initiatives that have contributed to 251 children leaving armed groups in the first half of 2025. Her small school in the village of Manuelico — reachable only by a winding road from Caldono — is surrounded by dense forest and coca fields planted and patrolled by armed groups. One young woman who recently fled FARC dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she joined the armed group at 16 not because she was forced but to escape family problems. As for the parents, she said: “I tell families they need to build trust with their children." Fernández, a woman in her mid-30s who asked to be identified only by her last name for fear of reprisals, was 12 when armed men came looking for her in her rural Cauca community.

Article: President Donald Trump to defend their security interests at an upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin FILE - President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to cow the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. In a statement early on Tuesday, the leaders said that they “welcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.” But, they underlined, “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” “A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force,” they said. Zelenskyy on Monday thanked European leaders for their support and urged for more diplomatic and economic pressure on Moscow as long as “they continue the war and occupation.” “We see that the Russian army is not preparing to end the war,” Zelenskyy posted on Telegram. Under such conditions, it is important that nothing threatens the unity of the world.” In Ukraine, a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian military training facility left one soldier dead and 11 others wounded, the Ukrainian Ground Forces posted on Telegram. “A lot will depend on availability, quantity and quality of Ukrainian reserves,” Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, wrote in a post on X late Monday. The region's Ukrainian military command posted on Facebook Monday that enemy soldiers penetrating Ukrainian lines to capture more territory "face inevitable death” but acknowledges that the situation remains “difficult, unpleasant and dynamic.” On Monday, Trump repeated that “there’ll be some land swapping going on.” He said that this would involve “some bad stuff for both” Ukraine and Russia.

Article: House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress. In an online post, Page wrote that state rules require the governor to issue a proclamation calling a statewide election at least 148 days before the date of the election — that would have been June 9. Page said if he waited for the Legislature and the governor to formally call the election, “it would be too late for me to actually conduct the election.” If it goes through, “We are going to make this work,” Page added.

The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said the measures go “well beyond the normal and rigorous regulatory air quality monitoring” and will assess parts of the valley for different types of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 pollutants and sulfur dioxide. Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a public health advocacy group in Pittsburgh, said the regulations were deemed to be almost insignificant to operational costs and would have helped protect the public with air quality monitoring. The regulation would have required — like is already required at refineries all over the United States — fence-line monitoring for hazardous air pollutants at the Clairton plant, Mehalik said.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying a Dragon capsule with a U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew of four, lifts off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39-A in Cape Canaveral , Fla., on Friday, Aug. The botched Starliner demo forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to switch to SpaceX to get back from the space station more than nine months after departing on what should have been a weeklong trip. “What we learn on these missions is what’s going to get us to the moon and then from the moon to Mars, which is I think the direction that NASA has to be,” Duffy said in a NASA interview. We want to claim that real estate for ourselves and our partners.” To save money in light of tight budgets, NASA is looking to increase its space station stays from six months to eight months, a move already adopted by Russia's space agency. Astronauts would remain on board until the last four to six months of the station's life to handle any breakdowns, with the empty outpost plunging into the Pacific by late 2030 or early 2031.

Article: Australian who killed UK woman eligible for earlier release after appeal Emma Lovell and her husband Lee moved to Australia from Suffolk in 2011 The man appealed, claiming his sentence was "manifestly excessive". Her attacker, who cannot legally be named as he was 17 at the time, was last year sentenced to 14 years in jail, with 70% to be served before he is eligible for supervised release. The attack in the suburb of North Lakes, about 45km (30 miles) north of Brisbane, sparked community outrage and was among several cases which prompted the state of Queensland to controversially introduce stricter youth crime laws. During the trial, the court heard that Lovell and her husband had confronted the two intruders, both teens at the time, in their home before forcing them out onto the front garden where a struggle broke out. The court of appeal judges found that her murderer's 14-year sentence was not "manifestly excessive", agreeing with the sentencing judge that the murder had been a "particularly heinous offence" which had provoked "a sense of outrage". However, the requirement that the man serve 70% of that sentence was excessive in light of an early guilty plea which had saved the victim's family from the trauma of a trial.

On Thanksgiving morning, sharing coffee with Adam in her garden, Carrie tells him that she wants to scrap the well-ordered garden he has already planted and return to something more “wild” and “free … something more me,” she says. It echoes a moment from the original series in which Carrie says in a voice-over, after confronting Big for marrying someone else, that perhaps the issue wasn’t that she couldn’t “break” Big. As the episode, and the series, comes to a close, we see Carrie dancing in her big house, click-clacking in heels, twirling in tulle, wholly herself, unbothered, uncompromised, unapologetic — untamed.

Article: But what did raise eyebrows among defence analysts and regional governments had occurred several weeks earlier when China sent its aircraft carriers into the Pacific together for the first time. Maritime expert and former United States Air Force Colonel Ray Powell described the “simultaneous deployment” of China’s two aircraft carriers east of the Philippines as a “historic” moment as the country races to realise Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambition of having a world-class navy by 2035. “No nation except the US has operated dual carrier groups at such distances since [World War II],” said Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project of the Gordian Knot Center at Stanford University. “While it will take years for China’s still-nascent carrier capabilities to approach that of America’s, this wasn’t just a training exercise – it was China demonstrating it can now contest and even deny US access to crucial sea lanes,” Powell told Al Jazeera. China’s state-run news agency Xinhua described the exercise by the aircraft carriers as a “far-sea combat-oriented training”, and the state-affiliated Global Times reported that China was soon poised to enter the “three-aircraft-carrier era”, when its Fujian carrier enters service later this year. Advertisement While the Chinese navy operates the world’s largest naval fleet with more than 370 ships compared with the US’s 251 active ships in commission, Beijing still lacks the global logistics network and advanced nuclear submarine technology required of a truly mature blue water force, Powell said. “[China] fully intends to close these gaps and is applying tremendous resources toward that end, and with its rapidly improving technical prowess and vastly superior shipbuilding capacity, it has demonstrated its potential to get there,” Powell said. “East Asia is a ‘home game’ for China – a place where it can augment its small carrier force through its far larger land-based air and rocket forces – including so-called [aircraft] ‘carrier killer’ missile systems that can strike targets up to 4,000km [2,485 miles] away,” Powell said. Japan’s Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said in June – after confirming that China’s two carriers had operated simultaneously in the Pacific for the first time – that Beijing apparently aims “to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace”. With the US increasingly perceived as becoming more inward-looking under President Donald Trump, Japan is considered a growing force in the contested maritime terrain in the Asia Pacific region amid what Tokyo has called “the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II”. Tokyo’s defence spending and related costs are expected to total 9.9 trillion yen (about $67bn) for fiscal year 2025, equivalent to 1.8 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP), and the government has committed to raising spending on defence to 2 percent of GDP by 2027, according to Japanese media reports. Advertisement “[Japan’s] naval capacity is growing steadily, not just in support of the US alliance but in quiet preparation for a more uncertain future – perhaps even one in which America withdraws from the Pacific,” said Mike Burke, lecturer at Tokyo-based Meiji University. Collin Koh, senior fellow at the Singapore-based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS), also said that China’s growing military might, assertiveness and proclivity to resort to coercive behaviour have “aggravated Japan’s threat perception”. Japan aims to build trust with other allies, Burke said, noting that Japan has worked on its soft power by funding radar systems, investing in civil infrastructure from ports to rail networks in Southeast Asia, and supporting maritime domain awareness initiatives in the region. Noriyuki Shikata, Japan’s ambassador to Malaysia, described Tokyo’s approach as a strength at home and reinforcing collaboration abroad with “like-minded countries and others with whom Japan cooperates”, in order to uphold and realise a free and open international order. “Japan has been strengthening its defence capabilities to the point at which Japan can take the primary responsibility for dealing with invasions against Japan, and disrupt and defeat such threats while obtaining the support of its [US] ally and other security partners,” the ambassador told Al Jazeera. Zachary Abuza, professor of Southeast Asia studies and security at Washington, DC-based National War College, said the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) is a world-class navy that is focused on building the highest level of capabilities. “That said, they [the Japanese] are nervous about Trump’s commitment to treaty obligations, and you can see the Japan Self-Defence Force is trying to strengthen its strategic autonomy,” he said. ‘Chinese assertiveness could result in an accident’ Geng Shuang, charge d’affaires of China’s permanent mission to the United Nations, said earlier this year that China was committed to working with the “countries concerned” to address conflicting claims in the South China Sea through peaceful dialogue. “The United States, under the banner of freedom of navigation, has frequently sent its military vessels to the South China Sea to flex its muscles and openly stir up confrontation between regional countries,” Geng was quoted as saying by Xinhua. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, a vast area spanning approximately 3.6 million square kilometres (1.38 million square miles) that is rich in hydrocarbons and one of the world’s major shipping routes. Speaking on the sidelines of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies’ Asia Pacific Roundtable 2025 summit in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year, Do Thanh Hai, deputy director-general at Vietnam’s East Sea Institute Diplomatic Academy, said no one will emerge unscathed from an incident in the disputed region.

Article: On Wednesday, following a virtual meeting with European leaders including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump warned of “severe consequences” if Putin refuses to accept a ceasefire after more than three years of war. “It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important … summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Ushakov said. When Russian Tsar Peter the Great dispatched the Danish navigator Vitus Bering in 1725 to explore the Alaskan coast, Russia already had a high interest in the region, which was rich in natural resources – including lucrative sea otter pelts – and sparsely populated. The war’s main theatre of battle became the Crimean Peninsula, as British and French forces targeted Russian positions in the Black Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire. According to calculations by Advocate for Peace, a journal published by the American Peace Society in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Russia spent the equivalent of 160 million pounds sterling on the war. For less than 2 cents an acre (4 metres), the US acquired nearly 1.5 million sq km (600,000 square miles) of land and ensured access to the Pacific northern rim. Oil revenues became the cornerstone of Alaska’s economy, funding public services as well as the Alaska Permanent Fund, which pays annual dividends – via returns on stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets – to residents.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article Louisiana’s top prosecutor sued the popular online gaming platform Roblox, alleging in a lawsuit filed Thursday that the company’s failure to implement strong safety protocols for children has made it “the perfect place for pedophiles.” The suit, filed by Attorney General Liz Murrill in Louisiana’s 21st Judicial District, accuses the California-based company of intentionally or recklessly designing a platform with no age verification process, allowing Roblox's tens of millions of users to easily create accounts with fake birthdays. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger [posed] to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.” The 42-page suit points to a raft of sexually-explicit “experiences” that have been on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe,” and it alleges that a man arrested on suspicion of possessing child sexual abuse material in Louisiana last month was using the platform at the time he was taken into custody. The suit, which alleges unfair trade practices, negligence and unjust enrichment, does not specify damages but seeks a permanent order barring Roblox from violating the state’s unfair trade practices act or promoting its safety features as adequate, which the suit says the company routinely does. A spokesperson for Roblox declined to comment on the allegations, citing pending litigation, but said the company dedicates "substantial resources" to help "detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours." "While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing," the spokesperson said. "The safety of our community is a top priority." In November, the platform announced a series of safety measures that barred users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages and included new content categories to help determine what is age-appropriate for users. Those measures were rolled out the month after New York-based analyst Hindenburg Research called Roblox an “X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.” Roblox denied the claim, saying in a statement that the analyst’s report was misleading and citing what it described as significant investment in trust and safety measures.

Article: President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine, more than three years after Moscow launched its invasion, as the two leaders prepared for a pivotal U.S.–Russia summit Friday in Alaska. Following a meeting Thursday with top government officials on the summit, Putin said in a short video released by the Kremlin that the Trump administration was making “quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities” and to “reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.” Putin also suggested that “long-term conditions of peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,” could be reached under an agreement with the U.S. In Washington, Trump said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that, if the meeting succeeds, he could bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting. Both Zelenskyy and the Europeans have worried that the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe’s future security in jeopardy. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tamped down expectations for any breakthroughs from the Friday summit, saying there were no plans to sign documents and that it would be a “big mistake” to predict the results of the negotiations, according to Russian news outlet Interfax. Ukraine's territorial integrity Starmer said Wednesday that the Alaska summit could be a path to a ceasefire in Ukraine, but he also alluded to European concerns that Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia. During a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — Starmer stressed that any ceasefire deal must protect the “territorial integrity” of Ukraine. Following Wednesday's virtual meetings, Macron said Trump told the assembled leaders that while NATO must not be part of future security guarantees, “the United States and all the parties involved should take part.” “It’s a very important clarification that we have received,” Macron said. Oleksandra Kozlova, 39, who works at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians “have already lost hope” that meaningful progress can be made toward ending the war. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don’t see any changes coming.” Anton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine's priority now should be saving the lives of its military service members, even at the expense of territorial concessions. "Borders are borders, but human lives are priceless.” Russia and Ukraine trade strikes Zelenskyy said Thursday that Ukraine had secured the release of 84 people from Russian captivity, including both soldiers and civilians. Those freed included people held by Russia since 2014, 2016 and 2017, as well as soldiers who had defended the now Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. In Russia, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged several apartment buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, near the border with Ukraine, where 13 civilians were wounded, according to acting governor of the region, Yuri Slyusar.

Article: All signs point to a slowdown of the Texas economy as job growth slows, construction declines and inflation ticks up, according to a Monday report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The report on the Fed’s recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys — recurring surveys of Texas business executives across industries — was published as President Donald Trump attempts to reshape the U.S. Luis Torres, a senior business economist with the Dallas Fed and author of the report, said the diversity of the state’s economy is its strength, allowing it to weather economic downturns better than the nation as a whole. “We have all of these things that are in favor of the Texas economy… and that gives way to higher levels of economic growth than the rest of the country,” Torres said. Tariff-driven inflation has not skyrocketed like many economists in opposition to Trump’s trade policy predicted at the start of his term, but the report cited data indicating what “could be the beginning of tariff pass-through.” The Texas consumer price index increased in May after falling for much of last year and through the start of 2025, according to the report. While the report said the inflation level is low, it called the lack of significant tariff-driven price increases “concerning and puzzling.” The nation's effective tariff rate has risen to 17.5% from 2.4% at the beginning of the year.

Article: Family of murdered cyclist says they feel let down by court system in light of suspect's record The family of a man, who was killed as he biked to work says they feel let down by the DA's office. HOUSOTN, Texas (KTRK) -- The family of a man who was killed a week ago as he biked to work told Eyewitness News that they feel let down by the court system. Vanessa Escobar told ABC13 her great uncle could be a bit of an introvert, but that when you could get a smile out of him, it would light up the room. "As a family, we are very upset at the individual (who) committed this crime, but also a lot of us practice a very traditional Christian practice of forgiving others," Escobar said. In 2024, Sheehan was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, but records show the Harris County District Attorney cut a deal with him, and he was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge of theft. ABC13 reached out to the DA's office, which sent the following statement: "When it comes to making decisions about how we prosecute cases, public safety and the law are always paramount. These include an evaluation as to whether the elements of an offense can be proven, and the ability to make contact with the victim after charges have been accepted." "I am somebody who strongly believes we live in a society that functions within systems that sometimes does not hold individuals accountable to their wrongdoings," Escobar said.

Article: Scott Applewhite/AP WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's "emergency police commissioner" with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." The Metropolitan Police Department "must receive approval from Commissioner Cole" before issuing any orders, Bondi said. Sponsor Message The attorney general's directive comes hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of "sanctuary policies." Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said. A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said. Sponsor Message "They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital," Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. "The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training." Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are "protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence." Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a "very small force" of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown. For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies.

Lai has been in detention continuously since December 2020 and is serving separate prison sentences for participating in a banned candlelight vigil and committing “fraud” on an office lease agreement.

Article: New Delhi, India – When United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin meet in Alaska on Friday, their summit will be followed closely not only in both those countries, Europe and Ukraine – but also more than 10,000km (6,200 miles) away, in New Delhi. New Delhi’s relations with Washington grew particularly strong under the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama, and remained that way during Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden. At the heart of that US warmth towards India, say analysts, was its bet on New Delhi as a balancing force against Beijing, as China’s economic, military and strategic heft in the Asia Pacific region grew. With Soviet communism history, and China, the US’s biggest strategic rival, Washington increased its focus on Asia – including through the Quad, a grouping also including fellow democracies India, Australia and Japan. Half of that penalty is for India’s purchases of Russian oil during its ongoing war with Ukraine – something that the Biden administration encouraged India to do to keep global crude prices under control. Meanwhile, China – which buys even more Russian oil than India – has received a reprieve from high US tariffs for now, as Washington negotiates a trade deal with New Delhi. Advertisement That contrast has prompted questions over whether Trump’s approach towards China, on the one hand, and traditional friends like India on the other, marks a broader shift away from the US pivot to Asia. Troubles for India, and Modi Since the early 2000s, successive governments in New Delhi have embraced closer ties with Washington, with its stocks rising in the US as an emerging strategic partner in security, trade and technology. “The tariff moves have triggered the most serious rupture in the US-India relations in decades,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That has now changed, with India accusing the US of hypocrisy – pointing out that it still trades with Russia, and that Washington had previously wanted New Delhi to buy Russian crude. To be sure, he pointed out, America’s Cold War history of bonhomie with Pakistan has meant that “a certain distrust of the US is embedded in the Indian strategic firmament”. The Trump administration’s recent cosiness with Pakistan, with its army chief visiting the US this year, even getting a rare meeting with the president at the White House, will likely have amplified those concerns in New Delhi. Advertisement But through ups and downs in India-US ties over the years, a key strategic glue has held them close over the past quarter century: shared worries about the rise of China. It is no longer clear to Asian partners of the US, say experts, whether Washington is as focused on building alliances in their region as it once said it was. Turn from Asia Under the Obama administration in 2011, the US adopted what was known as the “Rebalance to Asia” policy, aimed at committing more diplomatic, economic and military resources to the Asia Pacific region, increasingly seen as the world’s economic and geopolitical centre of gravity. This meant deeper engagement with treaty allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia, strengthening security ties with emerging partners such as India and Vietnam, and pushing forward trade initiatives like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The US withdrawal from the TPP in early 2017 removed the signature trade pillar, leaving behind a strategy that leaned heavily on military cooperation and less on binding economic partnerships. Yet, he refrained from the bulldozing negotiations that have shaped his approach to tariffs, even with allies like Japan and South Korea, and from the kind of tariffs Trump has imposed now on India. “There might be some cautious rebalancing in the short term from the Asian powers, who will wait for more clarity.” India, which, unlike Japan and South Korea, has never been a treaty ally to the US – or any other country – might already be taking steps towards that rebalancing. The concept of trilateral cooperation was first proposed in the 1990s and formally institutionalised in 2002, an idea Lavrov credited to the late Yevgeny Primakov, former chair of the Russian International Affairs Council. Although the RIC met regularly in the years following its creation, there has been a gap in recent times, with the last meeting of RIC leaders in 2019, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. And India does not turn on its friends.” But doubling down on its strategic independence from the US – or multi-alignment, as India describes it – could come with its costs, if Trump decides to add on even more tariffs or sanctions. “The best outcome for India immediately is the Russians and Ukrainians agree to a ceasefire,” said Kugelman, “because at the end of the day, Trump is pressuring India as a means of pressuring Russia.” Even as questions rise over Washington’s pivot to Asia under Trump, such a rebalance will not be easy for countries like India, say experts. “With China, while we may see a thaw in economic relations, it’s difficult to see a path to resolving broader security and geostrategic disputes.” Jon Danilowicz, a retired diplomat who worked in the US State Department, said that a total breakdown of the US-India partnership is in neither’s interest. Modi had been facing pressure from the opposition over the ceasefire with Pakistan after four days of military hostilities in May, after 26 civilians were killed in an attack by gunmen in Kashmir in April. The opposition has accused Modi of not going harder and longer at Pakistan because of pressure from Trump, who has claimed repeatedly that he brokered the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad – a claim India has denied. Many analysts have said they see Trump’s tariffs also as the outcome of as-yet unsuccessful India-US trade talks, with New Delhi reluctant to open up the country’s agriculture and dairy sectors that are politically sensitive for the Indian government.

Article: In an interview on Fox News, Bondi previewed an order by the Justice Department naming DEA head Terry Cole as "emergency police commissioner" of the Metropolitan Police Department, days after President Donald Trump directed the federal government to take control of the local police and deployed the National Guard in an effort to mitigate crime in the nation's capital. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Smith was serving as "operations lead in working with the federal government and federal forces that will be in the district." "We are ensuring that our chief of police is the leader and is working with her counterparts that have been named by the president, specifically the director of the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Marshals Service, to ensure that any additional officers that we have, and we expect that could range in the hundreds on any given night, will be deployed in the way that helps us drive down violent crime," Bowser, a Democrat, said Tuesday. Smith issued an order earlier Thursday allowing local police conducting traffic stops to notify Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents about undocumented immigrants they encounter, a moved Trump praised as a "great step" in his effort to "stop crime" in the city.

"When I first came to Houston, I saw that sign and it was part of the reason that I came here," said Ronald Derouen, who moved to Houston from Louisiana.

Article: Authorities in Mali have arrested a group of military personnel and civilians, including two Malian army generals and a suspected French secret agent, accused of attempting to destabilise the country. The minister said, “The situation is completely under control.” “The transitional government informs the national public of the arrest of a small group of marginal elements of the Malian armed and security forces for criminal offences aimed at destabilising the institutions of the republic,” Mohammedine said on national news. “These soldiers and civilians” had obtained “the help of foreign states”, Mali’s military said in a statement, adding that a French national – identified as Yann Christian Bernard Vezilier – was held on suspicion of working “on behalf of the French intelligence service”. One of the suspects, General Abass Dembele, is a former governor of the country’s central Mopti region, who was abruptly dismissed in May when he demanded an investigation into allegations that the Malian army killed civilians in the village of Diafarabe. Impoverished Mali has been gripped by a security crisis since 2012, fuelled notably by violence from armed groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the ISIL (ISIS) group, as well as local criminal gangs. The country’s military rulers, led by President Assimi Goita, have in recent years turned away from Western partners, notably former colonial power France, and aligned politically and militarily with Russia in the name of national sovereignty.

Article: There has been a sharp rise in drug use among Australians, with cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin consumption all hitting record levels, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission’s (ACIC) latest wastewater analysis. Published on Friday, the ACIC’s annual report revealed that Australians consumed an estimated 22.2 tonnes of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and MDMA (commonly known as “ecstasy”) between August 2023 and August 2024. This represents a 34 percent increase on the previous year’s findings, with marked increases in the consumption of cocaine (69 percent), MDMA (49 percent), methamphetamine (21 percent), and heroin (14 percent). ACIC chief Heather Cook said crime groups are exploiting high demand for illicit drugs in Australia, where they are “maximising profit at the expense of the community’s security and wellbeing”.

Article: He found a bomb under a playground - and there were 176 more 35 minutes ago Share Save Jo Lonsdale North East and Cumbria Investigations Share Save BBC Steven Parkinson uncovered the first of 177 bombs in Scotts Park For decades, generations of children have had a blast tearing round a Northumberland park and playground, all the while oblivious to a cache of World War Two bombs buried beneath them. Mark Mather The first two days of excavations by Brimstone unearthed so many bombs the whole park had to be dug up Steven's company got in touch with the clerk of Wooler Parish Council, Kerren Rodgers, but the find was equally baffling to the authority. "Dealing with a suspected bomb in a playground is not exactly something they cover in the clerk's manual," she says with a wry smile, "but we sealed off the site straight away." Wooler councillor Mark Mather recalls: "It was almost exciting. "I went along to the site and it definitely looked like a bomb, but obviously at that point nobody had any idea of the extent of what we were going to find." An Explosive Ordnance Disposal team arrived from Catterick Garrison and confirmed it was indeed a bomb from World War Two but, thinking it was an isolated find, renovations resumed the next day. Kerren Rodgers knew of no corporation manual to instruct on bomb disposal As with any building work, finding evidence of past life and indiscretions is not uncommon, especially in town parks. Dallan Tan, from the Association of Play Industries, says he has found "vintage whisky bottles, railway sleepers, barbed wire, sex toys and a gun, but never bombs" while installing play equipment. They would also do dig tests and CAT (Cable Avoidance Tool) scans, but in the 1980s, when the park was first installed, "health and safety standards would have been very different". "I don't think anyone is to blame, they were just really, really unlucky." Dallan Tan Dallan Tan can list a host of interesting finds in playparks, but not bombs In Wooler, the decision was taken to call in Brimstone, one of a handful of companies in the UK which specialises in the removal of wartime ordnance. Since it was founded in 2016 its staff have removed more than 200,000 items from sites across the UK, so associate director Adam Tanner says he has learnt "not to be surprised by anything in this job". Brimstone began with "delicate hand digging" around the initial pit and, over a two-day period, found a further 90 practice bombs which were used to train and drill bomber crews and pilots. "It was clearly done carefully and deliberately." Handheld detectors were used to scan the park and a huge amount of scrap metal was removed Brimstone was to spend a further three weeks at the playpark, using a handheld detector to survey the whole site and uncovering a huge amount of scrap metal alongside a final total of 177 bombs. "There were 2,000 military personnel stationed at RAF Milfield north of Wooler alone." Local historian Alan Sture says Wooler was well defended by a ring of pillboxes and an important training area for the military Alan is also sure there was an ordnance depot on the site during the war, with deliveries of munitions and supplies arriving via a spur from the Alnwick to Cornhill railway line. The short stretch of track and the depot buildings are visible in a 1948 aerial photograph and are described in archive interviews with locals Mattie Fairnington and Maurice Hardy who were teenagers during the war. Supplied A 1948 image of Wooler shows military buildings near where the playpark was later built In the 1981 recordings made by Glendale Local History Society the pair discuss their memories of "loads of troops coming and going" and "an ordnance depot" on Scotts Park. William Hartnett Almost no trace of RAF Milfield remains but up to 2,000 men and women were stationed there in the 1940s Weapons were stockpiled in huge quantities during the conflict and then had to be disposed of, with much just dumped in the sea. David Alexander, professor of emergency planning and management at University College London, says there was "millions of tonnes of unwanted ordnance all round the world" and "health and safety just didn't exist" in 1945. "I mean, bombs had been going off for six years." Historian Colin Durward says there is a huge amount of ordnance still buried across the country Colin Durward, who runs Blyth Battery, a set of wartime defensive structures on the Northumberland coast, says he "wasn't surprised at all" when he heard about the bombs buried in Wooler. "There was just tonnes of it stuck in the ground." Mark Mather Bombs away: The 177 devices no longer lurk under the swings of Scotts Park The park reopens later and, for councillor Mark Mather, born and bred in Wooler, it is a "huge relief".

Article: Dylan Feik, the city manager of Monrovia, in Los Angeles County about 10 miles northeast of Pasadena, said a police officer saw the raid after the police department received a call about U.S. “I assumed either he was hit by a car trying to cross or he must’ve gotten out of the vehicle from a car accident.” The Department of Homeland Security denied its agents chased the person and said they do not know the person’s legal status. "We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded." Feik said that the city did not have any additional information about the operation, including about any possible detentions, and that Monrovia has not received any communication from ICE. “Some of them were chasing workers in cars while they were running away.” Network organizers are trying to reach family members, as well as the other men who were detained, Figueroa said. Videos posted on social media appear to show agents detaining a person in the parking lot of the Home Depot, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the immigration activity. On Tuesday, Enforcement Removal Operations agents conducted a “targeted enforcement operation” at a Home Depot in Washington, D.C., as a part of the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on immigrants and homeless people in the city. An appeals court this month maintained a Los Angeles federal judge's temporary restraining order that bars immigration agents from using people’s spoken languages or jobs, like day laborer, or their presence at particular locations as the sole pretext to detain them.

Article: Navy Seal Erik Prince will soon deploy nearly 200 personnel from various countries to Haiti as part of a one-year deal to quell gang violence there, a person with knowledge of the plans said Thursday. The deployment by Vectus Global is meant to help the government of Haiti recover vast swaths of territory seized in the past year and now controlled by heavily armed gangs, said the person, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. "In the absence of a coherent, jointly led Haitian and international strategy, the use of private firms is more likely to fragment authority and sovereignty than to advance resolution of the crisis," he said. Sponsor Message The private contractors, which will come from the United States, Europe and other regions, are expected to advise and support Haiti's National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police officers that is struggling to suppress gang violence. The U.N.-backed mission has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year, according to a recent U.N. Paraison once served as head of security for Haiti's National Palace and was involved in a new task forced created earlier this year made up of certain police units and private contractors. Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, said that while there's an obvious need for more anti-gang operations, "there is a risk of escalating the conflict without having enough personnel to extinguish the fires that Viv Ansanm can ignite in many places." Viv Ansanm is a powerful gang federation created in September 2023 that saw the merging of gangs, including G-9 and G-Pèp — once bitter enemies. The gang federation was responsible for coordinating a series of large-scale attacks early last year that included raids on Haiti's two biggest prisons that led to the release of some 4,000 inmates. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

Walking through the humid, glowing greens of this cloud forest — known as Los Cedros — is what walking through damp moss might feel like if you had been miniaturized. The country’s Constitutional Court issued a landmark judgment that recognized Los Cedros as both a legal person and a rights-bearing entity — and ruled that the proposed mining projects would violate those rights. For almost two decades this small country has pioneered new ways of imagining and legislating the human relationship with other life on Earth — and inspired similar innovations around the world.

Article: Twenty years ago, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, dismantling 21 Jewish settlements and pulling out its forces 20 years after its landmark withdrawal from Gaza, Israel is mired there FILE - Palestinian police officers in new uniforms ride in the back of a jeep as they wait to enter the former Jewish settlement of Dugit, northern Gaza Strip, Sept. (AP Photo/Kevin Frayer) FILE - Palestinian police officers in new uniforms ride in the back of a jeep as they wait to enter the former Jewish settlement of Dugit, northern Gaza Strip, Sept. The Friday anniversary of the start of the landmark disengagement comes as Israel is mired in a nearly 2-year war with Hamas that has devastated the Palestinian territory and means it is likely to keep troops there long into the future. The anger helped them organize and increase their political influence, accounting in part for the rise of hard-line politicians like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. Israel couldn’t justify the military or economic cost of maintaining the heavily fortified settlements in Gaza, explained Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Misgav Institute and the Institute for National Security Studies think tanks. By contrast, there are more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, most living in developed settlement blocs that have generally received more support from Israeli society, Michael said. “They saw it as an achievement of the resistance and a justification for the continuation of the armed resistance.” Footage of the violence between Israeli settlers and Israeli soldiers also created an “open wound” in Israeli society, Michael said. At first relations were good with their Palestinian neighbors, she said, and they worked hard to build their home and a “beautiful community.” She had two more children, and three chose to stay and raise their families in Netzer Hazoni. After Israel’s withdrawal 20 years ago, many Palestinians described Gaza as an “open-air prison.” They had control on the inside – under a Hamas government that some supported but some saw as heavy-handed and brutal. Instead, he expects the military to continue controlling large swaths of Gaza through “buffer zones.” The aim, he said, is to keep Gaza “unlivable in order to change the demographics,” referring to Netanyahu’s plans to encourage Palestinians to leave the territory. There were an average of 10 attacks per day against Israeli settlers and soldiers, including rockets, roadside bombs big enough to destroy a tank, tunnels to attack Israeli soldiers and military positions, and frequent gunfire. People paint it as how wonderful it was there, but it wasn’t wonderful.” Harel says the decision to evacuate Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip was the right one, but that Israel missed crucial opportunities. There were short but destructive conflicts over the years between the two sides, but otherwise the policy gave Hamas “an opportunity to do whatever they wanted.” “We had such a blind spot with Hamas, we didn’t see them morph from a terror organization into an organized military, with battalions and commanders and infrastructure,” he said.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, Pool) South Korean President Lee Jae Myung speaks during a ceremony to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Aug. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, Pool) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, said Friday he will seek to restore a 2018 military agreement with North Korea aimed at reducing border tensions and urged Pyongyang to respond to Seoul’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive dialogue. Speaking on the 80th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Lee’s overture came amid soaring tensions fueled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear ambitions and deepening ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between Kim and South Korea’s former liberal President Moon Jae-in, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. South Korea’s previous conservative government suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. Lee said his government affirms “our respect for the North’s current system” and that the wealthier South “will not pursue any form of unification by absorption and has no intention of engaging in hostile acts.” Lee said South Korea remains committed to an international push to denuclearize North Korea and urged Pyongyang to resume dialogue with Washington and Seoul. “However, inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea dialogue as well as international cooperation will help us approach a peaceful resolution.” Japan’s defeat in World War II liberated Korea from colonial rule, but the peninsula was then divided into a U.S.-backed, capitalist South and a Soviet-supported, socialist North — a separation cemented by the devastating 1950–53 Korean War. Lee, whose speech came days before he plans to travel to Japan for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, took a conciliatory tone toward Tokyo, calling for the fellow U.S. However, he noted that some historical issues remain unresolved and called on the government in Tokyo to “squarely face up to our painful history and strive to maintain trust between our two countries.” Lee’s meeting with Ishiba will come just before he flies to Washington for a meeting with U.S. Lee, who took office after winning an early election in June following the ouster of his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol over a brief imposition of martial law in December, has taken steps to repair ties with the North, including the removal of South Korean frontline loudspeakers that Yoon’s government had used to blast anti-North Korean propaganda and K-pop across the border. military exercises, Kim last year declared that North Korea was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and rewrote the North’s constitution to mark the South as a permanent enemy. Lee’s speech came a day after Kim’s powerful sister mocked his government for clinging to hopes of renewed diplomacy between the war-divided rivals, and misleading the public by falsely claiming the North had removed its own frontline speakers as a reciprocal gesture toward the South. Kim Yo Jong also reiterated previous North Korean statements that it has no immediate interest in reviving long-stalled negotiations with Washington and Seoul, citing an upcoming joint military exercise between the allies as proof of their continued hostility toward Pyongyang. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Pyongyang has made Moscow the priority of its foreign policy, sending thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to help fuel the war. In his own speech marking Korea’s liberation on Thursday, Kim Jong Un praised the “infinite might” of the country’s ties with Russia at an event in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang attended by a Russian government delegation.

Few family trees seem stranger than that of Janjucetus dullardi, only the fourth species ever identified from a group known as mammalodontids, early whales that lived only during the Oligocene Epoch, about 34 to 23 million years ago. The tiny predators, thought to have grown to 3 meters (10 feet) in length, were an early branch on the line that led to today’s great baleen whales, such as humpbacks, blues and minkes.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) — Japan is paying tribute to more than 3 million war dead as the country marks its surrender 80 years ago, ending the World War II, as concern grows about the rapidly fading memories of the tragedy of war and the bitter lessons from the era of Japanese militarism. “Once again, we must deeply keep to our hearts the remorse and lesson from that war.” Ishiba, noting Japan’s mostly postwar-born population “who don’t know the war," pledged to pass on “the memory of the tragedy of war and non-war determination through generations and stick to actions toward achieving a lasting peace." In a national ceremony Friday at Tokyo's Budokan hall, about 4,500 officials and bereaved families and their descendants from around the country observed a moment of silence at noon, the time when the then-emperor's surrender speech began on Aug. As the population of wartime generations rapidly decline, Japan faces serious questions on how it should pass on the wartime history to the next generation, as the country has already faced revisionist pushbacks under Abe and his supporters in the 2010s. In an editorial Friday, the Mainichi newspaper noted that Japan's pacifist principle was mostly about staying out of global conflict, rather than thinking how to make peace, and called the country to work together with Asian neighbors as equal partners.

Article: House maps aimed at adding five Republican seats is poised to enter a new phase California pushes left, Texas to the right, with US House control and Trump agenda in play By MICHAEL R. BLOOD Associated Press , TRÂN NGUYỄN Associated Press , and NADIA LATHAN Associated Press LOS ANGELES -- A political standoff in Texas over proposed House maps that could hand Republicans five new seats is poised to enter a new phase Friday, while heavily Democratic California plans to release its own new maps intended to erase all but a sprinkle of the state's GOP House districts in the fight over control of Congress. The hectic maneuvering in the nation's two most populous states underscored the stakes for both parties in the narrowly divided House that could determine the fate of President Donald Trump's agenda in the second half of his term. The Democrats announced they will return to the state provided that Texas Republicans end a special session and California releases its own redrawn map proposal, both of which were expected to happen Friday. “We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,” Newsom said at what amounted to a campaign kickoff rally for the as-yet unreleased maps that Democrats have been shaping behind closed doors. We can shape the future.” The two states have emerged as the center of a partisan turf war in the House that could spiral into other states — as well as the courts — in what amounts to a proxy war ahead of the 2026 elections. In Missouri, a document obtained by The Associated Press shows the state Senate received a $46,000 invoice to activate six redistricting software licenses and provide training for up to 10 staff members. In Los Angeles, Newsom and other speakers veered from discussing the technical grist of reshaping districts — known as redistricting — and instead depicted the looming battle as a conflict with all things Trump, tying it explicitly to the fate of American democracy. “Gavin Newsom’s latest stunt has nothing to do with Californians and everything to do with consolidating radical Democrat power, silencing California voters, and propping up his pathetic 2028 presidential pipe dream,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Christian Martinez said in a statement. “Newsom’s made it clear: he’ll shred California’s Constitution and trample over democracy — running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority.” California Democrats hold 43 of the state’s 52 House seats, and the state has some of the most competitive House seats. Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers — enough to act without any Republican votes — and Newsom said he is not worried about winning the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers to advance the maps.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) BANGKOK -- China's economy showed signs of slowing in July as factory output and retail sales slowed and housing prices dropped further, according to data released Friday. Uncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over the world's second-largest economy after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days, beginning Monday, following a 90-day pause that began in May. As officials worked toward a broader trade agreement, China reported earlier that its exports surged 7.2% in July year-on-year, while its imports grew at the fastest pace in a year, as businesses rushed to take advantage of the truce in Trump's trade war with Beijing. The meltdown in the housing market hit just as the COVID -19 pandemic began, sapping one of the economy's main drivers of growth and causing dozens of developers to default on their debts.

Article: But it does not necessarily mean that the German Chancellor's overall position on Europe has changed, Jörn Fleck, senior director at the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told CNBC. It's Merz' way of being sensitive to industry leaders who are advocating for less Brussels-bureaucracy, according to Sudha David-Wilp, vice president of external relations and senior fellow at The German Marshall Fund of the United States. His tone will also be informed by his electorate which is "not fundamentally critical of Europe but is nevertheless conservative," said Henning Vöpel, CEO of the Centres for European Policy Network. "After the last German government, which often abstained on important European policy issues - often referred to as the 'German vote' - he wants to claim a new leadership role for Germany and therefore take a more brisk and critical stance," Vöpel said. The Atlantic Council's Fleck shared a similar view, saying Merz is under pressure to stand his ground in instances where EU issues like fiscal plans could impact German domestic politics or become a risk to his agenda at home. "For most, that clarity will be a welcome change of tone." However, while Berlin is now coming to Brussels with a new communication style, Germany's view on the bloc has not fundamentally changed according to Fleck. Merz and Trump appear to be building a solid relationship, setting the German Chancellor apart from many of his counterparts in the EU which have not yet been able to do so. June's Merz-Trump meeting in the Oval Office was broadly seen as a quiet win for the German leader, and more recently he was one of the key instigators of U.S.-European talks ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The German Marshall Fund's David-Wilp explained that "Merz is under no illusion that Germany and Europe need the United States, because a smooth working relationship with the White House is important for the continent's stability and prosperity." Instead of looking nostalgically to the past, his priority is to continue open communication and keep the transatlantic relationship constructive, she said. "Merz seems to have found the right balance in standing his ground on priority issues and leveraging European coordination while not getting drawn into unnecessary rhetorical skirmishes with the US president," he said.

Article: Vanuatu's Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu (C) delivers a speech as he attends a demonstration ahead of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) session tasked with issuing the first Advisory Opinion (AO) on States' legal obligations to address climate change, in The Hague on July 23, 2025. But for some, the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) recent advisory opinion on state's legal obligations in the face of climate change could emerge as a watershed moment for financial markets. Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz , one of the world's biggest insurers, said that close watchers of the ICJ's July 23 ruling described it as perhaps the most significant climate development since the 2015 Paris Agreement. Notably, the ICJ also found that fossil fuel production, including licensing and subsidies, "may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State." This opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something. Günther Thallinger Board member at Allianz The ruling, which was the brainchild of young law students in low-lying Pacific island states and championed by the government of Vanuatu, is widely expected to have far-reaching legal and political consequences. Speaking in a personal capacity, Thallinger said that while the ICJ's opinion is based on existing law and conventions, the ruling could yet have meaningful ramifications for a vast range of assets — whether one cares about climate change or not. "Even if they don't like the discussion around climate change, even if they would say they denigrate the Court of Justice completely, they must expect that, in some countries, some governments, some courts are going to follow this opinion," Thallinger said. So, this opinion for investors, for capital market participants, really means something." Licensing and subsidies On the issue of licensing and subsidies, Thallinger said the ICJ's ruling could prove to be a significant development. President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Yuji Iwasawa (C) and members issue first Advisory Opinion (AO) on States' legal obligations to address climate change, in The Hague on July 23, 2025. "As always, President Trump and the entire administration is committed to putting America first and prioritizing the interests of everyday Americans," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in response to the court opinion, Reuters reported. A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said the ruling has a "positive significance" for advancing international climate cooperation and sought to reaffirm the Asian country's status as a developing country. "I feel like the wide spectrum of views that exist in the investor community on climate change, and the action that investors are supposed to take, will probably mean that the decision is a bit of a Rorschach test," Lindsey Stewart, director of institutional insights for Morningstar, told CNBC by video call. Ida Kassa Johannesen, head of commercial ESG at Saxo Bank, said the ICJ's intervention is a non-binding advisory opinion, rather than a ruling, "and this distinction is crucial." Companies with significant environmental footprints, such as those in the oil and gas, mining and heavy industry sectors, are likely to face increased litigation risk, which could affect their costs, valuation and reputation, Johannesen told CNBC by email. "All this sends mixed signals which would probably lead to fragmented market responses between the world's 2 largest economies and the [rest of the world], slow down global regulatory convergence and ultimately limit the (short-term) impact on markets and investor behavior," Johannesen said.

Article: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Crew Dragon capsule Endeavour carrying the Crew-11 mission lifts off from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Aug. Italy's Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) became the first client who's signed on to send scientific experiments aboard SpaceX's first commercial flights to Mars — where Elon Musk's space company has yet to land. "Italy is going to Mars!" ASI President Teodoro Valente announced on social media, with Italian news outlet ANSA reporting the agency's payloads will feature a plant growth experiment, a weather surveillance station and a radiation sensor for data collection. ASI barely just made headlines at the end of last month, when it inked a deal to develop the first human lunar outpost with Thales Alenia Space — building on the Italian space agency's 2020 partnership with NASA to coordinate bringing astronauts back to the Moon under the Artemis Accords. Coming in third after France and Germany, Italy contributed 800 million euros ($935 million) — or 15.8% - to the European Space Agency's 7.68 billion euro adopted budget for 2025. A few days back, Amazon, whose chief Jeff Bezos owns his own rival rocket company Blue Origin, tapped Musk's company for the second time and launched its fourth batch of Kuiper satellites on SpaceX's 100th mission this year. SpaceX's reusable mammoth rocket Starship — the key to materializing Musk's Mars ambitions — has had a long-storied string of publicized test flight failures this year amid technical and refueling woes. That's skipping over a June incident when a Starship rocket exploded while being loaded with methane and liquid oxygen propellant ahead of its launch — due, Musk later said, citing preliminary data, to problems in the payload bay. Critically for our conversation, Starship is not yet rated crew-ready, and Musk himself has now pushed back his initial targets, flagging a "slight change" of a crewed flight during the next window in 2026, when Earth and the red planet are optimally aligned for travel to Mars. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years." It may seem too early to start selling tickets to Mars, it's no secret that launch capacity worldwide has been struggling to keep up with demand for space access.

Speaking on his new BBC podcast - The Wayne Rooney Show - the former Manchester United striker feels it is getting to the point where it is best for all concerned for Isak to move on.

Article: Navy Seal Erik Prince will soon deploy nearly 200 personnel from various countries to Haiti as part of a one-year deal to quell gang violence there, a person with knowledge of the plans said Thursday. The deployment by Vectus Global is meant to help the government of Haiti recover vast swaths of territory seized in the past year and now controlled by heavily armed gangs, said the person, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. "In the absence of a coherent, jointly led Haitian and international strategy, the use of private firms is more likely to fragment authority and sovereignty than to advance resolution of the crisis," he said. Sponsor Message The private contractors, which will come from the United States, Europe and other regions, are expected to advise and support Haiti's National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police officers that is struggling to suppress gang violence. The U.N.-backed mission has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year, according to a recent U.N. Paraison once served as head of security for Haiti's National Palace and was involved in a new task forced created earlier this year made up of certain police units and private contractors. Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, said that while there's an obvious need for more anti-gang operations, "there is a risk of escalating the conflict without having enough personnel to extinguish the fires that Viv Ansanm can ignite in many places." Viv Ansanm is a powerful gang federation created in September 2023 that saw the merging of gangs, including G-9 and G-Pèp — once bitter enemies. The gang federation was responsible for coordinating a series of large-scale attacks early last year that included raids on Haiti's two biggest prisons that led to the release of some 4,000 inmates. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

Article: Firefighters with air support are scrambling to control a fast-moving wildfire that erupted in hills along Interstate 5 in northwestern Los Angeles County This image provided by USDA Forest Service shows a 375 acre fire east of I-5 at Smokey Bear Road near Templin, Calif. The King Fire, which broke out around 1 a.m., charred nearly a square mile (2.5 square kilometers) of tinder-dry brush in a lightly populated area about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of downtown LA. The Gifford Fire, California’s largest blaze so far this year, has scorched nearly 207 square miles (536 square kilometers) of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on Aug. Wildfire risk is elevated because Southern California has seen very little rain, drying out vegetation and making it “ripe to burn,” the National Weather Service for Los Angeles warned in a statement last week.

Article: South Korea has said it intends to restore an agreement suspending military activity along its border with North Korea and revive inter-Korean cooperation, as President Lee Jae-myung attempts to dampen soaring tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear programme and deepening ties with Russia. Marking the 80th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule on Friday, Lee said he will seek to restore the so-called September 19 Military Agreement and rebuild trust with North Korea. “To prevent accidental clashes between South and North Korea and to build military trust, we will take proactive, gradual steps to restore the [2018] September 19 Military Agreement,” Lee said in a televised speech. But Seoul partially suspended the deal in late 2023 after it objected to North Korea launching a military spy satellite into space, with Pyongyang then effectively ripping up the deal as it deployed heavy weapons into the Demilitarized Zone between both countries and restored guard posts. Tensions then spiralled between the two Koreas under Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s conservative ex-president who was elected in 2022 but removed from office in April and is now serving jail time for his brief imposition of martial law in December. Advertisement South Korea and North Korea – separated along the heavily militarised buffer zone known as the 38th parallel – are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Making clear his desire to resume dialogue with Pyongyang since winning a snap election in June, South Korea’s new left-leaning President Lee has taken a softer tone and sought rapprochement with North Korea. Soon after his inauguration and in his government’s first concrete step towards easing tensions, Lee halted the South blasting propaganda messages and K-pop songs across the border into the North. Earlier this month, South Korea began removing its loudspeakers from its side of the border, while Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff claimed it had evidence that Pyongyang was doing the same. Kim, who oversees the propaganda operations of the Workers’ Party of Korea, which has ruled the country since 1948, accused Seoul of misleading the public and “building up the public opinion while embellishing their new policy” towards Pyongyang.

Fast forward a remarkable 12 months and Slot's Liverpool start the new campaign as Premier League champions, strolling to the title with a 10-point margin and four games to spare, barely threatened from Christmas onwards. What should have been a summer of celebration has been lived under the shadow of the tragic death of much-loved forward Diogo Jota, killed in a car crash, and the incident in which many Liverpool fans were injured at the title parade. After barely dipping into his spending pot last summer, Slot now has an array of new talent at his disposal following a remarkable summer spending spree that could yet comfortably top £300m - making the Reds firm favourites to retain their crown. Liverpool have signed Florian Wirtz, one of Europe's hottest properties, in a £116m deal from Bayer Leverkusen, a new pair of full-backs in Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong for a combined £70m from Bayer Leverkusen and Bournemouth respectively, then added Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike in a deal that could be worth £70m. Liverpool may yet add Newcastle United's £150m-rated rebel striker Alexander Isak to their ranks, which effectively means Slot cannot afford to fail to deliver a trophy and a challenge for the biggest prizes - namely another title and the Champions League.

Article: On a recent weekday, the 30-year-old mother clutched the ill toddler in her lap as she sat outside a government hospital in Maiduguri, the capital of northeast Nigeria’s Borno State. Amina is only one of some five million children across northeast and northwest Nigeria suffering from malnourishment in what experts have called the region’s most severe food crisis in years. The troubled northeast region has, for a decade and a half, been in the throes of a conflict waged by the armed group Boko Haram, and prolonged insecurity has disrupted food supplies. Advertisement Compounding the problem this year are the massive, brutal funding cuts roiling aid organisations, which have often stepped in to help by providing food assistance to the 2.3 million displaced northeast Nigerians. The World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations food aid agency and the world’s largest provider of food assistance, was forced to shut down more than half of all its nutrition clinics across the northeast in August, Emmanuel Bigenimana, who leads northeast Nigeria operations, told Al Jazeera from the agency’s site in Maiduguri. “That’s why I managed to go and get some seedlings, even though the insurgents are still on our neck.” Aid cuts risk more ‘violence’ The UN and its agencies were the focus of aid cuts from Washington in April, leading to the WFP receiving zero aid from the US this year, Bigenimana said. Like the US, other donors such as the European Union and the United Kingdom have also cut back on aid, instead diverting money to security as tensions remain high over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Muhammad Bashir Abdullahi, an officer with medical aid group Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, told Al Jazeera that more malnourished children are being admitted to the organisation’s nutrition facility in Maiduguri since early August.

Article: Judge strikes down Trump administration guidance against DEI programs at schools toggle caption Claire Savage/AP WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation's schools and universities. Sponsor Message The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all "race-based decision-making" or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. The new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were "good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair." Gallagher, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, rejected the government's argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal. "It initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished," Gallagher wrote. "Threatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration's war on education, and today the people won," said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO. Sponsor Message A statement from the Education Department on Thursday said it was disappointed in the ruling but that "judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level." The conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law. "Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies and practices," wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights. A further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using "illegal DEI practices." Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.

Article: A federal judge has struck down key parts of a Florida law that allowed parents to remove books they found objectionable from public school libraries Judge strikes down key parts of Florida law that led to book removal from libraries In this Oct. 10, 2018 photo, Angie Thomas, 30, a Jackson, Miss., resident whose book, "The Hate U Give," has been on a national young adult best-seller list for 82 weeks, finishes autographing a copy of her book at a reception in Jackson, Miss. Among the books that had been removed from central Florida schools were classics like Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Richard Wright’s “Native Son” and Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five.” “Historically, librarians curate their collections based on their sound discretion not based on decrees from on high,” the judge said. “There is also evidence that the statute has swept up more non-obscene books than just the ones referenced here." After the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed the law, school officials worried that any sexual content was questionable, a belief that was enforced by new state training that urged librarians to err on the side of caution. Supreme Court precedent in which the test is whether an average person would find the work prurient as a whole; whether it depicts sexual content in an offensive way; and whether the work lacks literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The lawsuit was brought by some of the nation's largest book publishers and some of the authors whose books had been removed from central Florida school libraries, as well as the parents of schoolchildren who tried to access books that were removed. The author plaintiffs included Angie Thomas, author of “The Hate U Give"; Jodi Picoult, author of “My Sister's Keeper"; John Green, author of ”The Fault in Our Stars"; and Julia Alvarez, author of “How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents.” The publisher plaintiffs included Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishing and Simon and Schuster.

Article: FILE - Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones speaks to the media after arriving at the federal courthouse for a hearing in front of a bankruptcy judge, June 14, 2024, in Houston. Phillip, File) FILE - Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones speaks to the media after arriving at the federal courthouse for a hearing in front of a bankruptcy judge, June 14, 2024, in Houston. Phillip, File) A state judge in Texas has appointed a receiver to take over and sell conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars assets to help pay the more than $1 billion he owes in legal judgments to the families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The Sandy Hook families won nearly $1.5 billion in judgments in 2022 against Jones and Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, in lawsuits filed in Connecticut and Texas accusing him of defamation and inflicting emotional distress. A federal Bankruptcy Court judge in Houston ordered Free Speech Systems' assets, including Infowars' production equipment and its intellectual property, to be sold at auction to help pay the Sandy Hook legal judgments. The sale process was derailed when the bankruptcy judge, Christopher Lopez, rejected the outcome of a November auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder over only one other proposal by a company affiliated with Jones. Lopez had several concerns about the auction, including a lack of transparency and murky details about the actual value of The Onion’s bid and whether it was better than the other offer. Jones called the auction “rigged." The judge rejected holding another auction and said the families could pursue the liquidation of Jones’ assets in the state courts where the defamation judgments were awarded. Jones said on air Thursday that the state court order was not valid because Free Speech Systems' assets are still under the control of the trustee in his bankruptcy case in federal court. Last November after The Onion was named the winning bidder, a bankruptcy court trustee shut down Infowars' Austin studio and its websites for about 24 hours, but then allowed them to resume the next day as disputes over the auction continued in court. Jones, who said in 2022 that he believed the Sandy Hook shootings were “100% real,” continues to appeal the Connecticut and Texas state court judgments against him, citing free speech rights and improper actions by judges in the two states.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO -- Friday is the 80th anniversary of then-Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's World War II surrender, but as living witnesses die and memories fade, questions remain in Japan about how the war should be taught to younger generations. Hirohito’s responsibility for the war remains controversial today, and Japan has struggled to come to terms with its wartime past, both at home and in the Asian countries it brutally invaded. Hirohito’s voice, which most Japanese were hearing for the first time because he was considered a living god, was not easy to understand because of poor sound quality and the arcane language he used. Hirohito’s son and grandson have repeatedly expressed deep remorse over the war, but prime ministers since 2013 have not apologized to Asian victims of Japan’s aggression amid a government lean toward revisionism.

Article: Eric Sweeney, now 19, had been living with his older brother’s family in Northfield when prosecutors say he fatally shot Kassandra Sweeney, 25, and her sons, 4-year-old Benjamin and 1-year-old Mason, in August 2022. He was scheduled to go on trial on first-degree murder charges next month but instead will plead guilty to the lesser charges during a hearing in Merrimack County Superior Court. About two months before the fatal shootings, he left the couple a note that read in part, “I do not belong in this family All I do is steal and lie and be irresponsible,” and closed with “I love you big bro and sis bye.” When he was taken into custody, Sweeney told police he had been in his room in the basement when he heard something break upstairs, a man with a deep voice yelling and multiple “pops,” according to court documents. Prosecutors had planned to show jurors video clips Kassandra Sweeney recorded on her phone showing her sons “engaging in playful behavior” the morning of the shooting, including one created just 10 minutes before Eric Sweeney left the house.

Article: United States President Donald Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday in a bid to find common ground that could lead to a lasting ceasefire deal in Russia’s three-year-long war on Ukraine. The highly anticipated meeting is the latest in Trump’s numerous, but so far unsuccessful, attempts to end the Ukraine war and keep the promises he made on the campaign trail last year, when he claimed he would end the conflict within 24 hours if elected. While President Trump has tried to downplay expectations ahead of the meeting, he also warned on Thursday that Russia could face “serious consequences” if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. Accompanying Russian delegation members include: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov, and Special Presidential Envoy on Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation Kirill Dmitriev. Advertisement Asked why Zelenskyy was not at the table, Trump chided the Ukrainian president at a White House news briefing on August 11, saying that Zelenskyy had ruled for three years and “nothing happened” in terms of ending the war. Analyst Neil Melvin of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based think tank, said Europe was essentially an observer in a matter that could determine its fate because it lacked leverage. That would give Russia complete control of the Donbas region, which includes Luhansk and Donetsk – Russia already controls almost all of Luhansk – in addition to Crimea and chunks of Kherson, Zaporizhia and other southern regions. In late July, the US slammed India with tariffs for buying Russian oil, and this week, US officials have warned of secondary sanctions on that country if Friday’s talks fail. If Kyiv pulls back and cedes all of the Donbas in return for Russia halting advances on Kherson and Zaporizhia, and handing back small occupied parts of Sumy and Kharkiv. He reiterated that on August 9, in light of Putin’s proposal to Trump, and stated that Ukraine would not “gift land to the occupier” and that it was impossible to do so under Ukrainian law. Following the three-way call between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders on Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined what the European coalition wanted: That the US not agree to any territorial deals without Ukraine being present Ukraine needs credible security guarantees as part of any peace deal, that is, a guarantee of non-invasion by Russia. However, others, like Melvin of RUSI, think this meeting is ultimately a play by Russia to stall the US from making good on its sanctions threat, while allowing Moscow to keep advancing militarily in Ukraine.

Article: Global plastic talks collapse as countries remain deeply divided 14 minutes ago Share Save Esme Stallard and Mark Poynting BBC News Climate and Science Share Save James Wakibia/Getty Images Global talks to develop a landmark treaty to end plastic pollution have once again failed. The UN negotiations, the sixth round of talks in just under three years, were due to end on Thursday but countries continued to negotiate into the night in the hopes of breaking a deadlock. Speaking on behalf of the island states, the northern Pacific nation of Palau, said on Friday: "We are repeatedly returning home with insufficient progress to show our people." "It is unjust for us to face the brunt of yet another global environmental crisis we contribute minimally to," it added. Reuters The core dividing line between countries has remained the same throughout: whether the treaty should tackle plastics at source – by reducing production – or focus on managing the pollution that comes from it. The group, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, argue that better waste collection and recycling infrastructure is the best way of solving the problem, a view shared by many of the producers themselves. "Plastics are fundamental for modern life - they go in everything," said Ross Eisenberg, president of America's Plastic Makers, a trade association for the plastic production industry in the United States. "Even if we manage to boost that over the next few decades to 15, 20, 30%, it would remain a substantial amount that is polluting the environment and damaging human health," said Dr Costas Velis, associate professor in Waste and Resource Engineering at Imperial College London. Speaking at the final meeting the EU delegation he said: "We see the outcome of this session as a good basis of future negotiations." However, the oil states remained deeply unhappy. Graham Forbes, Greenpeace head of delegation to the Global Plastics Treaty negotiations, said: "The inability to reach an agreement in Geneva must be a wakeup call for the world: ending plastic pollution means confronting fossil fuel interests head on.

Another 16 people, including women and children, died the day before in Bajaur district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when a massive cloudburst led to flash flooding, said rescue official Amjad Khan. Seven more people died Thursday in separate rain-related incidents in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is a split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both in its entirety, according to the state disaster management authority. Bilal Faizi, a provincial emergency service spokesman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said rescuers worked for hours to save 1,300 tourists after they were trapped by flash flooding and landslides in the Siran Valley in Mansehra district on Thursday. Faraq said Gilgit-Baltistan has been hit by multiple floods since July, triggering landslides along the Karakoram Highway, a key trade and travel route linking Pakistan and China that is used by tourists to travel to the scenic north.

Article: The clearing of homeless encampments in the nation's capital is unfolding under what President Donald Trump calls his Making D Trump's 'safe and beautiful' move against DC homeless camps looks like ugliness to those targeted By JACQUELYN MARTIN Associated Press , NATHAN ELLGREN Associated Press , MEG KINNARD Associated Press , and CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Ms. “I don’t want to be the one to wait until the last moment and then have to rush out.” President Donald Trump's housecleaning started with official Washington and the denizens of its marbled buildings, back in the bureaucracy-scouring days of the Department of Government Efficiency. “We see fellow human beings — neighbors, workers, friends and family — each made in the image of God.” For Andrew S., 61, the ugliness came Wednesday when agents he identified as being with the federal government treated him like an eyesore. At the encampment near the peace institute, a man named George, 67, walked away Thursday carrying an umbrella in one hand and a garbage bag with some of his belongings in the other. “I have known homelessness for so long that it is part of normal life at this point,” Jesse Wall, 43, said as he cleared his belongings Thursday from the site near the peace institute. He quoted a variation of the Bible's Golden Rule — “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” — and said, “The idea that he’s targeting us and persecuting us feels wrong to me.” Much of the clearing out Thursday was at the hands of local police. Wayne Turnage, a deputy mayor, said the district has a process to do it “the way it should be done.” The expectation was clear, if not overtly stated: Local police would go about the work in a more humane way than the feds. Jesse Rabinowitz from the National Homelessness Law Center said that, according to the briefing he received on the operation, people would be given the choice to leave or be detained at eight federal and 54 local sites. The intent, Rabinowitz said he believed, was to trash tents in the daylight (because authorities want the public to see that) and do the bulk of arrests in darkness (because they don't want that widely seen). Born and raised in Washington, Wesley Thomas spent nearly three decades on the streets, struggling with drug addiction, until other homeless people and charitable organizations helped him get clean through therapy and back on his feet.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan that India will punish its neighbor if there are future attacks on India as he marked 78 years of independence from British colonial rule. The treaty, which India suspended after the April massacre, allows sharing of the Indus River that runs about 2,897 kilometers (1,800 miles) through South Asia and is a lifeline for both countries. “India has now decided that blood and water will not flow together." Pakistan has said any effort by India to stop or divert the water from flowing into Pakistan would be considered an “act of war.” Modi did not directly mention U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on India in his Independence Day speech but said he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations with the U.S. Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has repeatedly described influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh as a “national security crisis” and claimed that unchecked Muslim infiltration from the country is leading to a demographic shift in India.

Article: Thousands of anti-government protesters are back on the streets of Serbia after two days of clashes with loyalists of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and riot police that left dozens injured or detained Serbian protesters are back on the streets as clashes with government loyalists escalate BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of anti-government protesters returned to the streets in Serbia on Thursday after two days of clashes with loyalists of autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic and riot police that left dozens injured or detained. In the northern city of Novi Sad, where the anti-Vucic revolt in Serbia started more than nine months ago, groups of young protesters shouted, “He is finished,” as they demolished the offices of the president's ruling Serbian Progressive Party. In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, and in Novi Sad, police in the evening fired multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesters who then moved to other locations in smaller groups. Vucic told pro-government Informer television that “the state will win” as he announced a crackdown on anti-government protesters, accusing them of inciting violence and of being “enemies of their own country.” He reiterated earlier claims that the protests have been organized from abroad, offering no evidence. The unrest throughout Serbia this week marked a serious escalation in largely peaceful demonstrations led by Serbia's university students that have shaken Vucic's firm grip on power in the Balkan country. The Serbian president has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms and of allowing organized crime and corruption to flourish in the country that is a candidate for European Union membership. The EU's Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos said the reports of violence were “deeply concerning.” “Advancing on the EU path requires citizens can express their views freely and journalists can report without intimidation or attacks,” Kos added on the social media platform X. He said “those who broke the law will be identified and sanctioned.” University students posted on X to accuse the authorities of trying to “provoke a civil war with the clashes” at demonstrations.

Article: President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, it'll be one of the most high profile summits of the year, and there's a lot at stake. Close followers of Moscow say Russia is not looking to end the war yet, however, given its advantageous position on the battlefield in Ukraine, where its forces occupy swathes of territory in the south and east. The talks could nonetheless be a watershed moment for stakeholders in the Ukraine war which has been raging for three and a half years, as well as a catalyst for geopolitical changes. CNBC takes a look at five major factors at stake in Friday's talks: Ceasefire Trump's central aim on Friday is to press Putin into a ceasefire but what form this might take, what promises could be made and what "red lines" might have to be crossed — particularly territorial concessions and security guarantees — to reach a deal will be key. watch now "Ending the Russia-Ukraine war remains one of President Trump's signature foreign policy goals, and Friday's Anchorage talks with Putin have raised expectations of a major diplomatic breakthrough," Helima Croft, head of Global Commodity Strategy and MENA Research at RBC Capital Markets, said Wednesday. "The purported deal discussion points are broadly similar to what has been previously floated; In return for halting its military offensive, Russia is apparently seeking to retain Crimea and the entire eastern Donbas region of Ukraine as well as secure a definitive end to Kyiv's NATO ambitions" she said, in emailed comments. Trump has sewn confusion and concern by vacillating over the thorny issue in the last week, talking about potential "land swapping" by Ukraine while also pledging to get as much territory back for it as possible. Ukraine aspires to membership of the European Union (as sell as NATO, although this is seen as an ambition too far) and both Kyiv and the EU argue that if Russia is given a slice of Ukrainian territory, he will regroup his forces and use the territory as a launchpad for a future wholesale invasion of Ukraine. "What the Europeans are trying to frame as non-negotiable preconditions for a deal with Russia (a ceasefire, a monitoring mission, "ironclad" security guarantees) might catch up with them after the U.S.-Russia summit," Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in a note Wednesday. Russia's economy Although Putin appears to be entering the talks from a position of strength rather than weakness, he could arguably look for an off-ramp from the war that has damaged Russia's economy, which is seeing slowing growth, labor shortages and rampant inflation which even Putin described as "alarming." ″[Putin] starts from a relatively strong position on the battlefield.

Article: Afghan whose details were in UK data breach at risk from Taliban if deported, son tells BBC A large number of Afghan refugees have been deported back to Afghanistan from Pakistan in recent years But the Afghan man's son said their case is particularly urgent, as if they are deported to Afghanistan, he fears they will be killed because of his father's Triples association. An Afghan man, whose details were accidentally leaked by the UK in a major data breach , has been detained in Pakistan for imminent deportation alongside several family members, his son told the BBC. The man and his family initially applied to the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) - which was set up to relocate and protect Afghans who worked with British forces or the UK government in Afghanistan - shortly after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. The family were in Pakistan waiting for a final decision on the application - which was endorsed by the Ministry of Defence last year - when Pakistani authorities came to take them away. The man's son, Rayan, whose name we are changing for his safety, told the BBC he avoided being rounded up after hiding in a hotel bathroom in the capital Islamabad with his wife and baby son as several of his family members were taken to a holding camp. "Some of my family are just children, the youngest is only eight months old, we kept begging the police to leave them." His brother later called from the camp to say officials informed them they would be deported, Rayan added. The situation is made more worrying by the fact the family's details were among those of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to resettle in the UK which were inadvertently leaked in February 2022. Rayan is now terrified police will come back to detain him, his wife and their child next, and said he has been pleading with the British High Commission in Islamabad to be relocated to another hotel for protection. He said Rayan's father and the Triples were "people that we need to help and we owe a duty to and we must ensure that they receive more than the minimum protection".

But their majority is narrow and to help maintain it, Trump has called for Texas lawmakers to redraw the voting maps to help GOP candidates in the election next year. An analysis by the Texas Legislative Council, an agency that provides research for state lawmakers, shows that while the current district Denver Harbor is in now voted for Kamala Harris for president last year, voters who would be in the new district went for Donald Trump by a wide margin. Everything from cutting services and Medicaid, all the things he didn't mention during the election, or said he's not going to cut, that's exactly what he's doing." Robles worries about what the redrawn district will mean for the environmental health of the neighborhood, which sits just a few miles from the Houston Ship Channel. "We already have a large number of people in our area that suffer from health problems, and then on top of that, you suffer from things like asthma, emphysema." Robles said people in Denver Harbor don't make much money compared to the neighborhoods it would be joined with in the new district. "They don't have these types of problems that we do." Why the GOP is seeking a new district But Republicans note that, while Denver Harbor's current district twists and turns across Houston and the surrounding county, its proposed new home is more compact.

"There are many, many states where redistricting for partisan performance has been a way of life for 20, 30 years, particularly in Democrat states." But partisan redistricting can overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. "I think what we're seeing here, and what we're witnessing in this redistricting proposal and the midterm cycle, is what I would call a master class in demographic manipulation," Adams said.

Article: As Republicans face voters during tense town halls, it's about sticking to the script toggle caption AP/Getty Images The August recess is a time for Congress to put in face time at home, meet with constituents and maybe lay the foundation for a reelection bid. This August, though, is quieter for some Republican members, as they navigate how to message about the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump's signature legislation signed into law in July. Ahead of the recess, the National Republican Congressional Committee, an organization dedicated to increasing the amount of GOP seats in the House, sent Republican lawmakers a memo to "Make August Count," with crafted messaging and language to use when interacting with constituents, encouraging them to go on offense to sell their legislative victories. In a statement to NPR, NRCC spokesperson Mike Marinella said Republicans are using the recess to "prove we deliver for America," trying to draw a distinction between the GOP and Democrats, stating the blue team is "knifing each other in primaries, bleeding support, and cozying up to criminals." "The contrast couldn't be clearer: Republicans fight for you - Democrats are tearing the country apart," he stated. Still, amid a flurry of events held by Democratic members of Congress eager to message against the legislation and Republicans in power, the fraction of Republicans holding town halls gives a sense of what is on voters' minds — and how the GOP has to address those concerns. "If you are able to work and you're 28yearsold and you choose not to work, you don't get free health care in America." Interview highlights Nebraska's Mike Flood got an earful from voters. He’s still stands by Trump’s agenda Listen · 7:04 7:04 Those are similar to the talking points the NRCC encouraged Republicans to focus on: issues that polled well among voters, including provisions in the bill that remove taxes on tips and overtime and work requirements for those on Medicaid. She wanted to know when he was going to "take as good of care of your constituents who are not super wealthy as you do of the ones who are wealthy." "It appears that people who are earning $200,000 and less are going to pay more in taxes. "What we did is we added in tax benefits for middle income workers $75,000 and below as it relates to overtime and as it relates to taxes on tips," Steil told Fulbright-Anderson. And that was the crown jewel of this One Big, Beautiful Bill." Jim Curry, a political science professor who studies Congress at Notre Dame University, said it's tough for Republicans to play offense on the megabill.

Article: Here's what to know toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP ANCHORAGE, Alaska — President Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska today, a momentous summit on American soil with a leader isolated by the West over the invasion of Ukraine. "Because of a certain relationship that he has with me, running this country … I believe now he's convinced that he's going to make a deal," Trump told Fox News Radio's Brian Kilmeade on Thursday. Sponsor Message "The more important meeting will be the second meeting that we're having: We're going to have a meeting with President Putin, President Zelenskyy, myself, and maybe we'll bring some of the European leaders on. European leaders who have backed Ukraine in its fight against Russia spoke with Trump on Wednesday, saying Putin must agree to a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine before any peace talks begin. Trump has given few details about why these talks would be different, though he did say this week that there would be "severe consequences" for Russia if it did not stop its war, without elaborating. Trump has talked about the possibility of a "land swap" between Russia and Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has strongly opposed ceding territory, noting that doing so would violate his country's constitution.

Article: A backlash to this reckoning helped propel Donald Trump back into the White House, where he has taken a whole-of-government approach to wiping out the idea that America has anything to apologize for. In March, Trump signed an executive order, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” criticizing versions of history that foster “a sense of national shame.” Museums and monuments, it said, should celebrate America’s “extraordinary heritage” and inculcate national pride. This week, the administration announced that it was reviewing displays at eight national museums — including the Museum of American History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum — and giving them 120 days to bring their content in line with Trump’s vision. Those references were restored last week, but with changes: The exhibit no longer says that Trump made “false statements” about the 2020 election or that he encouraged the mob on Jan. Amy Sherald, the artist who painted Michelle Obama’s official portrait, canceled an upcoming solo show at the National Portrait Gallery after being told the museum was considering removing her painting of a transgender Statue of Liberty to avoid angering Trump. “The Statue of Liberty is not an abstract canvas for political expression — it is a revered and solemn symbol of freedom, inspiration and national unity that defines the American spirit,” said Lindsey Halligan, a Trump lawyer who is now in charge of getting museums to reflect the administration’s ideology.

Article: Meanwhile, Israel – with US and European Union support – has been systematically starving the nearly two million remaining Palestinians in besieged Gaza, part of the almost 320 million people globally who are malnourished or at risk of starving to death in 2025. It’s part of a much larger pattern of hoarding and starvation that has its roots in Western norms around capitalism and settler-colonialism, a crime against humanity that rarely faces meaningful international repercussions. This is not an isolated atrocity: The rise of the West and the US was built on the massive hoarding of food resources for profit and the deliberate use of starvation to cow those already living under oppression. It is difficult to miss, in both the international news reports and the desperate social media posts of starved Palestinians begging for money, food and clean water, with many showing themselves and their children reduced to emaciated bodies. A recent poll by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research at the Israeli Democracy Institute shows that 79 percent of Israeli Jews are “not so troubled” or “not troubled at all” by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza. As of March, “a record 27.7 million people are in the grip of acute hunger … amid ongoing conflict linked to massive displacement and rising food prices” in the DRC, according to the United Nations. The two-year-long conflict in Sudan, which has killed an estimated 150,000 people, many of whose deaths were linked to famine, disease and starvation, has also left nearly 25 million in need of food assistance, including nearly 740,000 in North Darfur’s capital, el-Fasher, where the population faces starvation while under siege. But the West, as the world knows it today, began its quest for global dominance with the First Crusade in the 1090s, and with it, perfected its tactics for siege warfare and the deliberate starvation of Muslim and Jewish populations in the Holy Land (present-day Syria, Lebanon and Palestine), all in the name of Catholicism. Western Europe’s plundering of the Western Hemisphere not only formed the foundation of capitalism and the never-ending pursuit of profit worldwide, it also entrenched the use of famine, malnutrition and deprivation as tools to control and exploit subject peoples. From the 16th through the 19th century, the transatlantic slave trade, African chattel enslavement and forced labour of Indigenous peoples helped fill royal coffers in Europe and build great wealth for landowners across the Western Hemisphere. Outside the eventual United States, seven years was the average lifespan for most of the 12 million Africans who survived the horrors of the Atlantic crossing and arrived in the Western Hemisphere. Advertisement Beyond the Americas, around 10 million people starved to death during the Great Bengal Famine of the 1770s because the East India Company prioritised collecting food for Europe’s ports and imposing punitive taxes on South Asian peasants over saving lives. Between 1904 and 1908, in what is now Namibia and Tanzania, the ruling Germans “directly killed or starved to death” approximately “60,000 Herero” and “10,000 Nama” in Namibia, as well as “up to 250,000 Ngoni, Ngindo, Matumbi and members of other ethnic groups” in crushing colonial uprisings. Perhaps the political and psychological impact of famine and bubonic plague in 14th and 15th-century Europe helps to explain both the West’s penchant for colonisation and its weaponisation of food, and the denial of access to it, as punishment. As noted in the results of the 1944–45 Minnesota Starvation Experiment with 36 white men, the participants “would dream and fantasise about food” and “reported fatigue, irritability … and apathy,” including “significant increases in depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis”. As for the United States, the nation that began as the Jamestown colony in 1607 has operated under John Smith’s words for the past 400 years: “The greater part must be more industrious or starve. He that will not work, shall not eat.” America’s own colonial history and post-independence expansion also involved stealing land from Indigenous groups, burning crops and ensuring famine and massive Indigenous population decline. For the past 40 years, US presidents and Congress have enacted multiple bills requiring the nation’s poor to work for minimal food benefits or go without, including new work requirements for SNAP (food stamps) benefits enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year. In 2015, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell summed up the thinking of US business leaders and the Western world towards those living with food precarity: “They’re doing too good with food stamps, Social Security and all the rest.” I can attest to the impact of malnourishment and working just to eat. From the end of 1981 until I went off to college in 1987, one-third of every month at home in Mount Vernon, New York, was spent with little or no food in my belly, often with massive intestinal gas pains bloating my abdomen. Once, I dropped from 83 to 76 kilogrammes on my 188-centimetre frame in the 18 days after finishing my undergraduate degree, while working for Pitt’s Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in 1991.

Article: Putin, who has ruthlessly secured unprecedented power at home, has seen his army finally eke out a slight advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine after years of brutal back-and-forth fighting. Now, invited in from the diplomatic cold, the Russian leader headed for Anchorage full of praise for Trump’s “energetic and sincere efforts” ahead of the talks, which will see him set foot on American soil for the first time in a decade. Trump has warned there will be “very severe consequences” unless he agrees to stop the war and said Friday that Putin is “not going to mess around with me.” But for the Russian leader, the one-on-one sit down with Trump may already feel like a victory. “Trump has facilitated Putin’s acceptance back into international diplomacy, despite the fact that he ought to be finding it difficult to travel, given his status as an internationally wanted war criminal,” Giles told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday, pointing the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in March 2023. On the streets of Moscow, there was also a sense of positivity about the meeting and confidence in their leader, who has continually served as president or prime minister of Russia since 1999. Pavel Grbenyuk, 45, told NBC News the summit with Trump was important because “there should be a connection between Russia and America, two of the most leading powers,” and “there should remain a dialogue.” But Grbenyuk, who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, added that he thought it was “unlikely anything will change dramatically,” after the talks to end the war, which entered its fourth year in February. Elena Ionova, a soloist with Moscow’s Operetta Theatre, also said it was “good that this meeting is happening,” but that she didn’t “trust people on the other side.” She added that she was “worried about Putin’s fate.” “Of course, we would all like for all of this to end and end, at least, without any major catastrophes,” she said. It is hard to get an accurate sense of the weight of public opinion in Russia as a result of Putin’s yearslong crackdown on dissent, which has stifled political opposition and free speech. A recent survey by independent pollster Levada Center showed that the level of support for the Russian armed forces in Ukraine remained high at 75%, but that nearly two thirds of respondents supported peace talks. “Stripped of political narratives and competing interests, and based on Putin’s own statements and actions, his core demands have not changed,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank. Putin claims four Ukrainian regions — Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — as well as the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which he annexed in 2014, although Russian forces do not fully control all of the territory in each region. Stanovaya added that she thought Putin intended to “propose to Trump that the war be brought to an end, and will press the point that he genuinely wishes it to stop.” “His main objective is to persuade Trump that Europe and the current Ukrainian leadership are the obstacles to ending the conflict, and that a cessation of hostilities is possible if there are guarantees that Ukraine will not use any pause to rearm,” she said on X, adding that the Russian president “will strongly promote the idea that the U.S. and Russia are two great nations that should maintain good relations regardless of local conflicts.” Back in Moscow, Ionova said she hoped “everything will be fine,” adding “We wish that this summit will be successful for us, for Russia.”

The letter, which is addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; Adam Telle, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works; and Secret Service Director Sean Curran, requests answers to over a half-dozen questions by Sept. The Associated Press and other news outlets reported this month that the Army Corps of Engineers increased outflows from Caesar Creek Lake to the Little Miami River, where the Vances were kayaking, “to support safe navigation of U.S. Van Kirk said at the time: “The Secret Service often employs protective measures without the knowledge of the Vice President or his staff, as was the case last weekend.” In the letter, Schiff asks for confirmation that Vance was not told and, then, why he was "not informed of this planned manipulation of public resources for his personal benefit." Schiff also cites the Trump administration’s decision during the Los Angeles fires to release billions of gallons of water from two California reservoirs that were not positioned to help put out the wildfires. “With the most recent act at Caesar Creek Lake, the Trump administration is providing further evidence of its willingness to exploit public resources for the personal and political benefit of administration officials,” Schiff wrote. “I hope that the public scrutiny of the Caesar Creek Lake water release will refocus the Army Corps on its mission to deliver vital engineering solutions that secure the country, energize the economy, and reduce risk from disasters.” Schiff is being investigated himself by the Trump administration.

Article: On Facebook, health influencers with broad reach alleged that Covid vaccines cause severe brain damage or other severe side effects such as cancer, despite no scientific basis for those claims. In theory, interest in vaccines and the spread of related misinformation should have tapered off as the pandemic subsided, said Samuel Woolley, a tech and misinformation researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. In a statement, Communications Director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy “has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” White’s previous statements align with growing online skepticism toward vaccines and the belief that they have a slew of unacknowledged side effects. And a neighbor told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people.” The newspaper also reported, citing police incident reports, that the shooter said something similar to police last year, when he was threatening to harm himself and officers went to his home. Musk himself said in 2023 that he had an adverse reaction to a Covid vaccine booster, but he doesn’t appear to have elaborated on his symptoms or how long they lasted. In February, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, ended its independent fact-checking program in the United States and announced a “community notes” system, in which users can vote on fact-checks written by other users. Kari Bundy, an anti-vaccine health influencer with 212,000 followers on Facebook, wrote in a post after Friday’s shooting that she understood where the gunman was coming from even while she condemned the shooting. The preliminary paper didn’t show cause-and-effect or a correlation between vaccination and depression, but it quickly caught the attention of high-profile figures such as Musk and podcaster Joe Rogan, who pointed to it as evidence of the hazards of Covid shots. The preprint paper “feeds into a narrative that’s been around for years, that the Covid vaccine is spilling out these spike proteins that are poisoning people’s bodies, and that happens to coincide with a conspiratorial political framework that’s been around for a while,” said Dr. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., held a hearing with testimony from people who said vaccines injured them or their loved ones, and clips from the hearing spread on Facebook and other platforms. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said he’s not aware of evidence that depression is a side effect of vaccination. Kayla Bartkowski / Getty Images Kennedy has, on multiple occasions, tried to draw a connection between depression and a different vaccine, the one designed to protect against the human papillomavirus, or HPV. In a post on X in 2019 and in a 2020 podcast episode with anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree, Kennedy asserted without evidence that the HPV vaccine, which can prevent 90% of cervical cancers, was responsible for depression among teenagers in the United States. A small number of people, disproportionately young men, develop a form of heart inflammation known as myocarditis after having gotten the shot, although Covid itself is likelier to cause heart problems, including myocarditis. In a 2022 paper from CDC researchers published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, young people who developed myocarditis after Covid vaccinations often reported depression, with 46% of myocarditis patients surveyed saying they had it. A study published in the journal npj Vaccines in July, whose release coincided with a spike in online searches for “vaccine depression,” found a similar rate of depression among young people with post-vaccination myocarditis. The paper, which British researchers published in JAMA Psychiatry, found that depression and other mental illnesses were elevated for up to a year in people with severe Covid who hadn’t gotten a Covid vaccine. And in the Yale preprint paper, posted on an online platform where researchers can share and receive feedback about unpublished work, researchers outlined what they called a “post-vaccination syndrome,” a collection of various symptoms that they said resembled long Covid. The report looked at 64 people — 42 with the proposed syndrome and 22 without — and found that participants with the syndrome reported depression at higher rates than other vaccinated people. One of the paper’s lead authors, Akiko Iwasaki, a Yale professor of immunobiology, cautioned in The New York Times that the report was “still a work in progress.” Two of the co-authors, but not Iwasaki, belong to an advocacy organization for people who believe they were injured by Covid vaccines. The group is involved in litigation demanding compensation for vaccine injuries and challenging federal officials for labeling their claims as “misinformation.” One author, Brianne Dressen, is suing AstraZeneca over her participation in its Covid vaccine trial, claiming the company failed to appropriately compensate her after she developed nerve damage that she attributes to the vaccine. Gaffney, of Harvard Medical School, said some of the preprint paper’s authors are “very serious scientists and people held in high esteem,” but he called the symptoms branded as “post-vaccine syndrome” in the paper “disparate.” “We should just think twice before we enshrine new diagnoses that are premised on a cause-and-effect relationship that may be tenuous,” he said. 1 podcaster in the country by some charts, generally referred to vaccine side effects in the segment and said the findings in the preprint paper — which he referred to as a “study” without noting that it hadn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal — were evidence of a massive cover-up. “Everyone’s covering up, and people are lying about [it], and everyone’s trying to obfuscate, and doctors are trying to sweep things under the rug because they don’t want to be in trouble for mandating these things and telling people to get these things,” he said, referring to Covid vaccines. Alex Berenson, an anti-vaccine writer, got more than 7 million views for a post on X in which he called the preprint report “very, very worrisome.” And Musk shared a post about it on X, boosting the idea of “vaccine injury.” Representatives for Jones and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment. In an email Tuesday, Berenson said he doesn’t have a view on whether vaccines can cause depression, but he noted the link between the Covid vaccines and myocarditis and said that could be a potential mechanism that ultimately leads to depression. He said he stood by his X post in February and called the Yale preprint paper “highly concerning.” He also said it would be foolish to blame vaccine skeptics for the CDC shooting. At least two other posts on X alleging vaccines cause depression got more than 1 million views, both citing a study out of South Korea last year that suggested an increased risk of depression after Covid vaccination but a decreased risk of other psychiatric conditions.

Article: It happened in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018 when Trump, standing next to him, suggested he believed Putin's denial that Russia interfered in the 2016 election over the findings of U.S. At the time, Trump said U.S.-Russia relations had "never been worse" than before they met but that had "changed." Now, Trump is set to hold his first one-on-one meeting with Putin of his second term at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. The backdrop for Friday's highly-anticipated summit is a darker one, amid Russia's relentless onslaught on Ukraine and Putin presenting a frustrating obstacle to Trump's professed desire to end the war. The meeting will spotlight their relationship -- one that Trump said during the 2024 campaign was so strong he could end the conflict on his first day in office or even before. "It seems that Donald Trump used to think that he understands Putin well and has a good rapport with him, but over the last few months we've seen him alter his position in that regard and actually become more frustrated with Putin. I think he's becoming more moderated in his expectations about what the meeting can bring," said Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump made several public demands of Ukraine, including that it would have to give up its goal of joining NATO and possibly cede some territory, while notably not setting any such red lines for Russia. The president even sympathized with Putin's status as a global pariah, saying in February that he would "love" for Russia to rejoin the Group of Seven nations and that it was a mistake for Moscow to have been expelled from the company of world leaders following Putin's annexation of Crimea. In July, Trump said he was fed up with the "bull---- thrown at us by Putin." "He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless," he said. Trump has kept American-made weapons supplied to Ukraine through a deal with European partners and recently slapped steep secondary tariffs on India, one of the largest purchasers of Russian oil, in indirect pressure on Moscow. President Donald Trump speaks to the press about deploying federal law enforcement agents in Washington to bolster the local police presence, in the Press Briefing Room at the White House, in Washington, August 11, 2025. He's called it a "feel-out meeting" and the White House described it as a "listening exercise." At the same time, he warned again this week of "severe consequences" if Russia didn't end the conflict. "I think that Trump believes that strongmen of Putin's kind are to be negotiated with eye to eye, and he wants to feel the ground to see what he gets from the meeting with Putin. The problem with that is Putin is also a shrewd manipulator and he has the KGB background, he is known to be very convincing and make people like him in person," said Snegovaya.

Article: The Shinto shrine was built in the 19th century to honour Japan’s war dead, but it is best known for enshrining 14 Japanese “class A” war criminals and 1,000 others also found guilty by an Allied tribunal after World War II. The Yasukuni Shrine is considered a political lightning rod in East Asia, where memories of Japan’s wartime atrocities are not forgotten, but senior Japanese leaders have continued to visit over the years. But the shrine was just one site where Japanese people gathered on Friday to mark 80 years since Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender in an August 15, 1945, radio broadcast. Ishiba also spoke of Japan’s “remorse” over the war, marking the first time a Japanese prime minister used the term in more than a decade at a war memorial, the news outlet said. “It is my sincere hope that we carry on passing down the stories of the hardships endured during and after the war and continue in unity of spirit to seek peace and the happiness of the people in the future,” he said, according to Japanese media.

Article: A private security company run by Blackwater founder Erik Prince will send hundreds of fighters to violence-racked Haiti to combat the country’s gang violence problem and restore its tax collection system, according to United States media reports. Prince, a controversial figure who is a major donor to Donald Trump, revealed details of the new mission for his company, Vectus Global, in an interview with the Reuters news agency on Thursday. Prince told Reuters that he expected Vectus Global, his US-based private security firm, which provides logistics, infrastructure and defence, would regain control of gang-held roads and territory in Haiti within about a year. ‘Several hundred’ personnel For years, Haiti has been plagued by violence and insecurity as powerful armed gangs, often with ties to political and business leaders, have vied for influence and territorial control – a situation that worsened dramatically after the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. The source said the company would deploy “several hundred” personnel from the US, Europe and El Salvador who were trained as snipers and intelligence and communications specialists, along with boats and helicopters. The Haitian government has not commented on the reports, but in June, the then-leader of Haiti’s transitional presidential council, Fritz Alphonse Jean, confirmed that the government was using foreign contractors. Blackwater’s track record of abuses The involvement in Haiti of Prince, a former US Navy Seal who is the brother of former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has prompted concerns, especially given the controversial past of his previous company, Blackwater. Since Trump’s return to the White House, he has consulted with Ecuador on how to combat gang violence, and reached a deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to help secure and tax mineral wealth. Advertisement “Resorting to private military companies cannot be seen as a solution to insecurity in Haiti,” Gedeon Jean, head of Haiti’s Center for Human Rights Analysis and Research, told AP. “The use of private companies has often resulted in human rights violations.” Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, head of the Haiti programme at Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime, told AP that Vectus Global’s mission in Haiti would violate US law unless it had permission from Washington to proceed. “⁠In the absence of a coherent, jointly led Haitian and international strategy, the use of private firms is more likely to fragment authority and sovereignty than to advance resolution of the crisis,” he said. A Trump administration official said the US government had no involvement with the hiring of Vectus Global by the Haitian government, and was not funding or exercising any oversight of the mission, the AP reported. Earlier this year, a team from US security firm Studebaker Defense ceased its operations in Haiti after two personnel were abducted, likely due to corrupt police officials, The New York Times reported.

Article: On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that China had urged companies against using Nvidia's H20 chips, or those from Advanced Micro Devices , especially for government and national security use cases, citing sources familiar with the matter. In response to the report, Nvidia said in a statement that the H20 "is not a military product or for government infrastructure," and that banning the sale of H20 in China would only harm U.S. In a separate report , The Information said regulators in China had gone so far as to order major tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent, to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether until the completion of a national security review. "We're hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies," Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein, told CNBC. It also throws a wrench into Nvidia's plans to maintain market share in China, as CEO Jensen Huang tries to navigate his business through increasing tensions and shifting trade policy between the U.S. Beijing's probe into Nvidia comes after the House and Senate proposed laws that would require semiconductor companies like Nvidia to include security mechanisms and location verification in their advanced artificial intelligence chips. According to chip industry analysts, however, the actions against Nvidia also highlight that Beijing remains steadfast in chip self-sufficiency campaigns and is likely to resist the Trump administration's plan to keep American AI hardware dominant in China. "It is signaling to Chinese tech firms that they must continue to support Huawei's AI development, even if Nvidia's chips are better," Chris Miller, author of "Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology," told CNBC. Building its domestic supply chain China has long had the desire to build up a self-reliant chip supply chain, and many experts say those efforts have been accelerating since chip export restrictions first took effect in October 2022. While China's domestic GPU (graphics processing unit) companies remain behind Nvidia in both scale and advancement, they have been beneficiaries of massive state funding and restrictions on Nvidia's most advanced chips. Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, told CNBC that Beijing appears to be trying to tackle constraints to the local adoption of Chinese-made chips — based on regulators' questions about the H20s that were posed to local AI developers. However, he added that it's unclear how long the investigation will last, and that delays to the H20's return could create more room for local players as AI companies search for alternatives. Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, said recent moves by Beijing are likely meant to send a message that the H20s present a potential security concern, and the government will be monitoring their use very closely. In the meantime, assuming the H20 chips are allowed back in the market, they are expected to benefit local AI developers as they wait for the domestic industry to continue to advance. "Access to US technology can still be valuable when Chinese AI developers and chipmakers are experiencing these growing pains under compute constraints, but Beijing wants to ensure the roadmap is still driving toward self-reliance in the end," said Rhodium's Goujon.

Article: Fears of starvation in Myanmar as UN warns of 'disaster' 24 minutes ago Share Save Jonathan Head and BBC Burmese BBC News, in Bangkok Share Save Getty Images Communal fighting and war have displaced some hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in Rakhine State Aid agencies are warning of starvation in war-torn Myanmar's Rakhine State, with the World Food Programme (WFP) making an urgent appeal for more donations to avoid a "full-blown disaster". The agency has been trying to feed the rapidly rising number of displaced people in the state, including the 140,000 Rohingya Muslims who have been living in camps since they fled their homes during communal fighting in 2012. Last week an elderly couple who had been displaced by the recent fighting between the Myanmar military and the insurgent Arakan Army are reported to have hanged themselves in despair over their lack of funds and food. Getty Images A building in Rakhine State that was destroyed in an airstrike The WFP has reported a 60% drop in its worldwide funding this year compared with 2024, and says it can feed only 20% of those in Myanmar facing severe food insecurity. "People are trapped in a vicious cycle - cut off by conflict, stripped of livelihoods, and left with no humanitarian safety net," said Michael Dunford, the WFP Representative in Myanmar. Families are doing everything they can, but they cannot survive this alone." Rakhine was already badly affected by the violence in 2012, and then the killing and mass expulsion of Rohingyas in 2017. Then in 2023 the military blocked all trade and transport routes to the rest of the country to try to cut supplies to the Arakan Army, an insurgent group that has advanced quickly to take over most of the state. Thousands of Rohingya men have been enlisted to help defend Sittwe, and those families who have not sent a man to join up must help pay to support those who have.

Roughly 21 feet tall, the mural, of 12 large panels, was painted by the Brooklyn-based artist Adam Cvijanovic (pronounced svee-YAHN-o-vitch), who titled it (with a slight word adjustment) after a song popularized by Elvis Costello, “What’s So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding.” Along with immigration, he depicted a historic event dear to the cardinal’s heart: the Holy Apparition at Knock, in which 15 people in the Irish village of that name in 1879 reported seeing the Virgin Mary, two saints and the Lamb of God, a symbol of Jesus Christ, in a vision that lasted for about two hours on a wall of the parish church.

Article: Love her or hate her, there is at least one admirable thing about Carrie Bradshaw, the journalist-protagonist of the famed series “Sex and the City” and its revival, for HBO Max, “And Just Like That …”: No matter the situation, her fashion was undeniable. Kooky, whimsical and often experimental, her wardrobe declared itself in every episode since the pilot of the original series aired on HBO in June 1998, all the way through to the finale of the streaming reboot, which was released on Thursday. And as a result, her closet of curiosities, both figuratively and literally — whether it was the walk-through hallway of her Upper East Side studio apartment or the museum of a wardrobe in her current Gramercy Park townhouse — became its own character. The styling of the other core characters — Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) — changed over time, but Carrie’s exaggerated skirts and hats and heels and dresses remained one of the show’s few constants.

Article: President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit also deals a heavy blow to the West's policy of "nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine's mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting, a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to. When asked in Anchorage about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia "never plans ahead." "We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over "a working breakfast." They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his meeting goals In the days leading up to the summit, set for a military base near Anchorage, Trump described it as " really a feel-out meeting." But he's also warned of "very severe consequences" for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, "He's not going to mess around with me." Trump's repeated suggestions that a deal would likely involve "some swapping of territories" - which disappointed Ukraine and European allies - along with his controversial history with Putin have some skeptical about what kind of agreement can be reached. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said he sees "no upside for the U.S., only an upside for Putin." "The best that can happen is nothing, and the worst that can happen is that Putin entices Trump into putting more pressure on Zelenskyy," Kelly said. George Beebe, the former director of the CIA's Russia analysis team who is now affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said there's a serious risk of blown expectations or misunderstandings for a high-level summit pulled together so quickly. "That said, I doubt President Trump would be going into a meeting like this unless there had been enough work done behind the scenes for him to feel that there is a decent chance that something concrete will come out of it," Beebe said. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will "deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe's position as the toughest enemy of Russia." The summit could have far-reaching implications On his way to Anchorage Thursday, Putin arrived in Magadan in Russia's Far East, according to Russian state news agency Interfax. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visit would include meetings with the regional governor and stops at several key sites, including a stop to lay flowers at a WWII-era memorial honoring Soviet-American aviation cooperation. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia's much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see "whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible." "Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply," said Kendall-Taylor, who is also a former senior intelligence officer. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit's venue "underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine." Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location.

Article: Ex-RAF test pilot says Chinook crashed on 'show flight' 28 minutes ago Share Save Calum Watson and Megan Bonar BBC Scotland News Share Save PA Media Four crew and 25 passengers were killed when the helicopter crashed in June 1994 A Chinook helicopter that crashed in Scotland, killing 29 people more than 30 years ago, was being flown as a "show flight" after safety concerns were raised about its airworthiness, a former RAF test pilot has said. Retired Squadron Leader Robert Burke said the Mark 2 version of the Chinook had been chosen to demonstrate to the Army that a recent upgrade from the Mark 1 version was safe. Sq Ldr Burke, who was a unit test pilot based at RAF Odiham at the time of the crash, made the new allegation during recent discussions with relatives who have been campaigning for a new public inquiry. Many of the passengers who died were senior members of the security services who were travelling from RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland to Fort George near Inverness, for a conference believed to about the Troubles in Northern Ireland. "The reason why that aircraft was flown in spite of all the reservations, and indeed the request from one of the dead pilots at the time, was to show the Army that the Chinook programme was running on time and the Mark 2 was perfectly safe to go into service," he said. A reckless act, but a show flight - it's as simple, and utterly tragic, as that." It was previously revealed that the pilots had requested to fly a Mark 1 version of the Chinook or two Puma helicopters which were on stand-by. 'A lifetime of bereavement' Patricia Conway Patricia Conway lost her father, Det Ch Supt Desmond Conroy, in the disaster Patricia Conroy, from South Belfast, lost her father, Det Ch Supt Desmond Conroy, in the crash. Ms Conroy said: "I feel sick to my stomach to discover that this flight was a show flight to effectively try to end an argument between the RAF and the Army about the safety of the Chinook fleet. "Instead, that decision ended my Daddy's life and started a lifetime of bereavement, trauma and a search for the truth." Several families have written an open letter to the UK government renewing calls for a public inquiry.

Article: INGRAM, Texas — In the fall of 2021, a real estate executive whose company was planning to upgrade an RV park along the Guadalupe River assured officials that guests would have time to flee in the event of a flood. People would stay “as close as we can get to the river,” Minh Tran, a partner at HTR Investors, the company that had recently bought the park, told Ingram’s City Council. “I’m a poor man’s weatherman, so I’m watching it all the time.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But when a catastrophic flood struck Central Texas in the early morning hours of July 4, sending the Guadalupe surging to record levels, at least 37 of those killed were staying at HTR TX Hill Country, according to interviews with victims’ relatives and friends. (Video: @DavidEReal4) A Post investigation found that, after downplaying the danger at the council meeting, HTR pursued an upgrade that kept RV sites in the Guadalupe’s “floodway,” a designation for areas that face such high risk from fast-moving water that some states and counties consider them too hazardous to build on. During the 2021 meeting, some city leaders said they welcomed the revenue the upgrade could bring — and, a person at the company said, the city later issued a floodplain permit to HTR. Federal guidelines allow RVs to be placed in floodplains as long as they are on-site for fewer than 180 consecutive days or are “fully licensed and ready for highway use.” HTR and its partner in the project, Boston real estate firm the Davis Companies, said in a statement that the severity of the flooding on July 4 could not have been anticipated and that failures in public warning systems meant they had little advance notice. The companies said their communities were devastated by the tragedy and that their property manager’s actions that night “saved many lives.” The companies said they are reviewing the approvals granted for work at the site and “are confident we are in compliance.” Advertisement “The HTR campground in Ingram existed for decades prior to our purchase in 2021, and our infrastructure improvements focused exclusively on modernizing outdated utility and sewer systems and decreasing the number of available sites on the property,” said Scott Deveau, a spokesman for the companies. “These improvements were welcomed by the community and approved by local officials, and they did not increase the RV sites’ proximity to the Guadalupe River.” Through Deveau, Tran declined to comment. Less attention has been paid to the many RV parks in a valley known as “Flash Flood Alley.” Advertisement The Post found that 12 campgrounds in Kerr County, which includes Ingram, have RV lots located within the Guadalupe River’s high-risk floodplain, an area where there is at least a 1 percent chance of flooding each year, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. On July 4, six of those in the floodway and four of the others experienced physical damage from the floods, ranging from trees being flattened to RVs being swept away, according to interviews with residents and a review of satellite imagery, local news reports, and photos and videos posted to social media. Stuart Gross, Ingram’s code enforcement officer and a retired sheriff’s deputy, said he is exploring ways for the city to prevent future RV parks from opening on land designated as a floodplain. “If anywhere along the line, common sense would have kicked in, we would have never had that loss of life, at least not this far down river.” Concerns about the campground that would later become HTR date back to at least 1989, when a developer, Robert Mobley, sought approval for what a local newspaper article described as a “recreational subdivision” in the river’s floodplain. Kathy Rider, who served from 2020 to 2022 as mayor of Ingram, a city of fewer than 2,000, said Tran’s team met her in advance of the City Council hearing. “I said, ‘You don’t understand, everything south of your campground office is going to wash away and be gone.’” Advertisement At the hearing, Tran said the revamped RV park would be a destination for people from Austin, San Antonio and other big cities as well as “snowbirds” — a prospect that Rider said would benefit the city, the recording shows. Rider said the city’s floodplain administrator would have to sign off on HTR’s development plans, adding that “RV sites are probably not going to be a real issue because they’re not permanent structures.” The council approved the sewer variance. Advertisement City officials declined repeated requests from The Post for documents related to the floodplain permit described by the person at HTR, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Rider’s husband, a first responder who has frequently raced down to the riverfront during heavy rains to pound on RV doors to get people out, spoke to the park’s management as well, she said. Gene Rhodes, who built Blue Oak on the site of a campground wiped out by the deadly flood in 1987, recalled watching several years ago as the HTR houses were towed into the park. “It was going to wipe out 35 years of my work.” Advertisement Advertisement Flood experts said the death toll at HTR is a reflection of the lack of attention most local and state governments have paid to RV campgrounds in flood-prone areas. “Regulation standards overwhelmingly focus on permanent buildings, and the Texas flooding shows campsites and RV parks are really an area of floodplain management that has not been given the attention it needed,” said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, a nonprofit group that offers professional training and certifications. “For floodplain managers, what happened in Texas has to be viewed as an unacceptable loss of life.” In 2006, FEMA published a floodplain training document advising that RV parks “should not be permitted in flash flood areas since there may be loss of life if flooding occurs as well as loss of the recreational vehicles.” FEMA has reprinted the 19-year-old recommendation in every training guide since, archived versions show, but it has never been required. It’s outside our jurisdiction.” On July 4, as the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry dumped months’ worth of rain, the Guadalupe rose more than 20 feet in a matter of hours. “We have children trapped in the water,” one emergency responder radioed at 4:35 a.m., asking a dispatcher to send help to what she described as “Howdy’s RV park,” an apparent reference to Blue Oak. Sue and Lyle Glenna, the on-site caretakers at HTR that night, were asleep in their trailer when the fire department called at 4:45 a.m., their son Wes Glenna said in an interview. said he worked in the RV industry for 23 years and understood the business but feared that campgrounds along the Guadalupe would be allowed to rebuild without new policies in place to protect people. “Why are we letting people put RVs and tiny homes down there?” Surveying the river from the patio of Howdy’s Bar & Chill recently, Canales said he and Guillén would rebuild Blue Oak.

Article: New York City’s school system unanimously passed a resolution this year that prohibits Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from entering schools and accessing campus facilities, students and student records without a judicial warrant. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Los Angeles Unified School District officials unveiled the new policy the same day ICE agents pulled a 15-year-old student from a relative’s car outside Arleta High School in Los Angeles. “This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our community.” As the Trump administration increases its enforcement action, broadening who they detain and where they conduct raids, parents fear that school campuses — once considered off limits to federal agents under long-standing ICE policy — won’t be spared from the crackdowns. School leaders across the country told The Washington Post in January, days after the second Trump administration took office, that they are trying to reassure immigrant parents that it is still safe to send their children to school. Parents are very hopeful that their kids can have some sense of normalcy,” said Evelyn Aleman, founder of Our Voice, a local group in Los Angeles that serves as a forum for Latino and Indigenous families. While the agents were denied entry because they did not have a warrant, Carvalho said LAUSD remains concerned with what happens “beyond the schoolhouse, where we lose jurisdiction.” Advertisement Advertisement With that in mind, he said, LAUSD will distribute “family-preparedness” packets containing know-your-rights information, resources and telephone hotlines to call should “anyone in that family be apprehended.” The school district has also altered and added bus routes and deployed more than 1,000 staff members on the first day of school with focus on areas that have seen ICE activity. Advertisement Carvalho told reporters Monday that the school district has seen a 7 percent increase in enrollment for online academies, though he did not clarify whether the spike was connected to immigration fears. In New York, where roughly 900,000 students are enrolled in the public school system, district leaders have advised principals to obtain a copy of the ICE warrant, court order or subpoena if agents come asking to see a student. 25, that they should decline to “provide any information about students, families or staff unless directed by the office of general counsel.” Sylvia Barragan, a spokesperson for Chicago Public Schools, told The Post in an email that ICE agents are barred from accessing district facilities without a signed judicial warrant.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article HONG KONG — The marathon national security trial of pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai is nearing conclusion in Hong Kong as President Donald Trump vowed to “do everything I can to save” the media tycoon from what critics say is political persecution by Chinese authorities. But they were postponed twice on Thursday and Friday, first due to a severe thunderstorm that closed courts and then to allow time for Lai, who has complained of heart palpitations, to receive medication and a portable heart monitor. Lai, a 77-year-old British citizen who is one of the Chinese territory’s most prominent democrats, was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law over his role in mass anti-government protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. Isaac Lawrence / AFP via Getty Images Lai has pleaded not guilty to two national security charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and a third count under colonial-era legislation of publishing seditious materials in Apple Daily, his now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid. Trump said Thursday that he would “do everything I can to save him” in talks with Chinese officials, even if Chinese President Xi Jinping “would not be exactly thrilled” to let him go. Trump appeared to be softening a claim he made about Lai last year, when he said on a podcast that “100%, I’ll get him out” of China and that it would be “so easy.” “I didn’t say 100% I’d save him. The government of Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, said Wednesday that Lai was receiving a fair trial and accused “external forces” of trying to interfere in Hong Kong courts. With a verdict still weeks away, the hearing on Friday drew fewer people than rulings and sentencings in recent cases such as the sedition trial against two Stand News journalists or the subversion trial against 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists. But after many years in jail, it’s now gone,” said Lui, who wore a T-shirt bearing the American flag and the words “Land of the Free.” Members of the public gallery waved at Lai, wearing a white windbreaker and thick-rimmed black glasses, as he appeared in the courtroom Friday in a glassed-in area surrounded by four guards. Lai has already been convicted in three separate cases related to unauthorized assembly and is serving five years and nine months in prison over a 2022 fraud conviction, cases that have also been criticized as politically motivated.

Article: The league champions are planning to pay tribute to their former forward, who died at the age of 28 in a car crash in northern Spain last month alongside his brother Andre Silva, who was 25. A moment of silence will be held at all Premier League matches this weekend, with players wearing black armbands, while messages and images will be shown on the big screens in stadiums. Liverpool confirmed there will also be a fan-led tribute at Anfield, with a special mosaic unveiled in the Kop and the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand during the period of silence. In his programme notes for Friday's game, Liverpool manager Arne Slot says: "We know that this will be a very emotional occasion, given it is the first league game we have played since we lost Diogo and Andre. "As I have said previously, the tributes that have been paid throughout the football world, and especially within the LFC community, have been truly special, and I know that tonight we will come together to honour them once more. The club earned a record-equalling 20th English league title last season with Jota wearing the number 20 shirt, which the club decided to retire after consulting with the former Portugal international's wife Rute Cardoso and other members of Jota's family.

(AP Photo/Bilal Hussein) Hezbollah supporters chant slogans as they gather to welcome Ali Larijani, head of Iran's National Security Council, outside Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Bilal Hussein) BEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group on Friday vowed not to disarm, saying last week's decision by the national government to remove the Iran-backed group's weapons by the end of the year serves Israel’s interests. Naim Kassem said the government’s decision to remove “the defensive weapons of the resistance, its people and Lebanon during an aggression” facilitates the killing of “resistance fighters and their families and evict them from their land and homes.” He said the government should have instead “spread its authority and evicted Israel from Lebanon.” Speaking in a televised speech to mark a Shiite religious event, he added “the government is serving the Israeli project.” Kassem added if the ongoing crisis leads to an internal conflict, the government is to blame. The small Mediterranean country has been under international pressure to get Hezbollah to lay down its arms since the 14-month war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November. However, the Hezbollah leader said his group will only discuss a national defense strategy over its weapons once Israel withdraws from Lebanon and stops its almost daily airstrikes that have killed scores of Hezbollah members since the war's end. Israel’s military has said the five locations in Lebanon provide vantage points or are located across from communities in northern Israel, where about 60,000 Israelis were displaced during the war.

Article: On Thursday, they moved on a Home Depot parking lot in Monrovia, sending laborers running, including a man who jumped a wall and onto the 210 Freeway, where he was fatally struck. Advertisement Since a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting federal agents from targeting people solely based on their race, language, vocation, or location, the number of arrests in Southern California declined in July. The number of arrests in these incidents was not immediately known, but the fear that pervades the sweeps underscores how Home Depot has emerged this summer as a key battleground in the fight over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and Southern California. Advertisement “Home Depot, whether they like it or not, they are the epicenter of raids,” said Pablo Alvarado, the co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a group that represents the tens of thousands of day laborers working in L.A. California ‘They run, we chase’: Immigration raids test limits of ‘probable cause’ The masked agents tackling day laborers at Home Depot and chasing workers at car washes are accused of using people’s race, language, jobs and location as probable causes that they are undocumented. 6, when a man drove a Penske moving truck to a Home Depot in Westlake and began soliciting day laborers when, all of a sudden, Border Patrol agents jumped out of the back of the vehicle and began to chase people down. 8, they conducted two raids outside a Home Depot in Van Nuys in what DHS described as a “targeted immigration raid” that resulted in the arrest of seven undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. “And it’s not just day laborers they are taking,” Alvarado added, noting that when federal agents descend on the hardware store’s parking lots, they question anyone who looks Latino or appears to be an immigrant and ask them about their papers. “They also get customers of Home Depot who look like day laborers, who speak Spanish.” The national hardware chain — whose parking lots have for decades been an unofficial gathering point for undocumented laborers hoping to get hired for a day of home repair or construction work — was one of the first sites of the L.A. After last Friday’s raids on Van Nuys, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said four of the seven individuals arrested had criminal records , including driving under the influence of alcohol, disorderly conduct and failing to adhere to previous removal orders. “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists — truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.” Activists say that federal agents are targeting Home Depots because they are hubs for a constant flow of day laborers — mostly Latino and a great deal of whom are undocumented. Advertisement “They know that at the Home Depot there will always be people who are day laborers, many of them undocumented,” said Ron Gochez, a member of the Unión del Barrio, a group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps. “And so they figured it would be a much easier, faster and more effective way for them to kidnap people just to go to the Home Depot.” Another reason the hardware store parking lots had become a focal point, Gochez said, is that they present a wide, open space to hunt people down. “And when some of the day laborers started running inside of the Home Depot stores, the agents literally have chased them down the aisles of the store.” In Los Angeles, pressure is mounting on Home Depot to speak out against the targeting of people outside their stores. “They haven’t issued a public condemnation of the fact that their customers have been abducted in their premises.” This is not the first time Home Depot has found itself in the center of a political firestorm. On Tuesday, a coalition of advocacy groups led a protest in MacArthur Park and urged Angelenos to support a 24-hour boycott of Home Depot and other businesses that they say have not stopped federal immigration agents from conducting raids in their parking lots or chasing people down in their stores. They’re actually, we think, in some way collaborating, whether directly or not.” Home Depot denies that it is working with federal agents or has advance notice of federal immigration enforcement activities. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.” Advertisement Lane said Home Depot asked associates to report any suspected immigration enforcement operations immediately and not to engage for their own safety. “If associates feel uncomfortable after witnessing ICE activity,” he added, “we offer them the flexibility they need to take care of themselves and their families.” The targeting of day laborers outside L.A. Since the 1960s, day laborers have formed an informal labor market that has boosted this sprawling city, helping it expand, and in recent months they have played a pivotal role in rebuilding L.A. neighborhoods, day laborers are such a constant, ingrained presence at Home Depots that the city’s Economic and Workforce Development Department sets up its resource centers for day laborers next to the stores. Huerta, the Director of Litigation and Advocacy of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, part of a coalition of groups suing Homeland Security over immigration raids in L.A., said the pick up of raids at Home Depot parking lots was “deeply troubling” and raised serious concerns that the federal government was continuing to violate the July temporary restraining order. “This looks a lot like it did before a temporary restraining order was in place,” Huerta said.“My sense is they feel they can justify raids at Home Depots more than roving raids.” Lawyers, Huerta said, were investigating the raids and asking some of the people taken into custody a series of questions: Did agents ever present a warrant? “The government is saying, ‘No, we’re allowed to ask questions, and people can volunteer answers.’ But we’ve argued that in many of these cases, people don’t feel like they cannot speak.” Attorneys will likely present information about the arrests to court at a preliminary injunction hearing in September, Huerta said, as they press Trump administration attorneys for evidence that the arrests are targeted. One man, a 22-year-old who was getting gas across the street from a Home Dept last Thursday, Huerta said, was detained even though he had special immigrant juvenile status as he was brought to the U.S.

Article: 1 Hurricane Friday afternoon, forecasters say Tropical Storm Erin is forecast to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by Thursday and could become a major hurricane by Sunday. The storm could bring some gusty winds, rain, rough surf and rip currents to parts of the far northeastern Caribbean as it slides just north of the islands this weekend. They aren't quite as warm as the record levels reached in 2023 and 2024, but are still far warmer than they'd be in a world that wasn't heating up due to fossil fuel pollution. Erin could explode in strength once it reaches this very warm water and become the season's first major hurricane - Category 3 or higher - by Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Bermuda High - a large, semi-permanent area of clockwise circulating high pressure that meanders over the Atlantic Ocean - is often in the driver's seat in this case: When the high turns the steering wheel, the hurricane generally follows. But if Erin develops more slowly, the system could stay lower in the atmosphere, where the trade winds - winds that flow clockwise around the equator - could keep it tracking to the west and prevent it from turning. An area of showers and thunderstorms in the southern portion of the Gulf has a medium chance of becoming a tropical depression before the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. The stormy area has a short window to develop while drifting over the very warm water of the Gulf before it moves inland, likely in northeastern Mexico or southern Texas, by Friday night. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain is in place Friday in far southern Texas with a Level 1 of 4 risk for the rest of the state's Gulf Coast, as well as parts of southern Louisiana, due to the anticipated arrival of moisture-loaded air, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

Article: The Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, plans to spend $10 million returning a Confederate monument to Arlington National Cemetery less than two years after an independent commission recommended its removal. Hegseth and President Donald Trump are embracing Confederate monuments and supporting changing the names of military bases back to what they were when they honored Confederates — for the same reason Southern governments began embracing the Confederate battle flag during the Civil Rights Movement. Similarly, the president and the defense secretary are celebrating dead Confederates not because they want us to remember the exploits of long-dead traitors but to wage war against those people who got many of those monuments taken down — and took some down themselves. And, in what seem like trial balloons to see how much they can get away with, we’ve seen mentions of Black war veterans, including Jackie Robinson and Harriet Tubman, temporarily removed from federal websites and the Air Force temporarily remove a training video featuring the Tuskegee Airmen. Ty Seidule, the vice chair of the commission, said the group found that the memorial, which sanitizes slavery, was “problematic from top to bottom.” But Trump and Hegseth have already repeatedly shown their disregard for that commission and Congress as a whole. Similarly, Hegseth appears to be getting around Congress’ prohibition on naming things for Confederates by calling what was known as “The Arlington Confederate Monument” a “reconciliation monument.” Historian Kevin Levin, an expert on the fight over Confederate monuments, has written that the people who created and funded the monument never used the word “reconciliation” to describe it and that Hegseth “referring to this monument as a ‘Reconciliation Monument’ is a willful act of deception away from the fact that is a celebration of slavery and of the Confederacy itself. They’re doing battle, as Hegseth put it, with “woke lemmings.” On Tuesday, Texas’ Midland Independent School District Board of Trustees voted 4-3 to change the name of Legacy High School to Midland Lee High. “Robert E.” isn’t a part of the new name, and the board president wants us to believe that the new “Lee” “does not reference any one specific individual but explicitly references the school’s 60 years of family, hard work and accomplishments in sports and academics.” But it’s doubtful that anybody in the Texas city will be confused. As quoted by the Midland Reporter-Telegram, Trustee Matt Friez said, “We live in a time where being offended has almost become a way of life or an addiction for some.” He said that “I reject the notion that being the most offended represents the moral high ground” and that he won’t “conflate the horrors of true, intentional racism with the legalistic and morally elitist outrage of every imaginable micro-offense by community agitators and dividers.” He’s saying the same thing Hegseth said in his social media post — just with a lot more words. The motivation couldn’t be clearer: This re-renaming spree isn’t motivated by concerns related to 19th century American history or putting the history of the Civil War in its proper place.

Article: In January, Putin echoed this claim, blaming the war on the 2020 election, which he, like Trump, falsely asserted was “stolen.” Trump also promised, on dozens of occasions in 2023 and 2024, to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours if re-elected. But as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine began, Trump called it “genius.” Once back in office, in February he and Vice President JD Vance publicly humiliated Zelenskyy during a now-infamous White House meeting. In April, Trump even blamed Zelenskyy for provoking Russia’s invasion and also chided him for not accepting Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a move that Trump claimed would have cleared the way for a political brokered by him. Last week, Trump dispatched the White House’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate ally with no previous diplomatic experience, to Moscow to meet with Putin for the fifth time this year. After one trip, for example, he stated that Putin had organized referendums in occupied Ukrainian provinces in September 2022 and that the local population chose to join Russia, adding for good measure that these are “Russian-speaking” areas. Witkoff seemed not to know that international law deems wartime referendums conducted by an occupying country illegitimate — for obvious reasons — and that, in any event, Russia did not control all four provinces back then and still fully occupies only Luhansk. In practice that would require Ukraine to cede the Donbas region (the province of Donetsk and Luhansk) to Russia in return for retaining those parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south that remain under Kyiv’s control.

Article: In July 2018, ahead of a bilateral meeting in Helsinki, White House officials provided Trump with a lengthy briefing book, intended to steer the Republican into taking a firm line with his Russian counterpart. After a private meeting with the Russian leader in which the American president confiscated his interpreters’ notes for reasons that were never explained, the Republican held a disastrous press conference in which Trump defended America's adversary, took cheap shots at his own country, and sided with Putin over the judgment of American intelligence professionals. Putin.” One official summarized a consensus view, concluding that it was clear whose side Trump was on, and “it isn’t ours.” Former CIA Director John Brennan argued at the time that Trump’s performance in Helsinki exceeded the threshold of “high crimes [and] misdemeanors,” was “nothing short of treasonous,” and offered timely evidence that “he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.” Then-Sen. John McCain went so far as to call Trump’s appearance in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” The Arizona Republican, a month before his death, added, “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.” Politico reported around the same time that the bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill was that Trump “thoroughly embarrassed the United States.” In some circles, the diplomatic gathering quickly came to be known as Trump’s “Surrender Summit.” In theory, it shouldn’t be too difficult for the second summit between these two to be less of a disaster.

Article: This week’s visit to Lebanon of senior Iranian politician Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, is seen as an attempt to smooth any feathers ruffled by rhetoric from Tehran about Hezbollah’s disarmament. In early August, the Lebanese government, under pressure from the United States, announced that it would seek to disarm Hezbollah, long considered a principal ally of Tehran, by the end of the year. The group reacted angrily to the call to disarm with its secretary-general, Naim Qassem, denouncing the idea on Friday and saying the Lebanese government “does not have the right to question the resistance’s legitimacy”. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in an interview last week: “We support any decision the group makes, but we do not intervene.” “This is not the first time they’ve tried to strip Hezbollah of its weapons,” he said. “But it doesn’t act simply as a proxy for Tehran and is in the midst of a rather challenging period of its existence, especially given the surrounding geopolitics of the region,” he said of the regional upheavals since Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023 and launched subsequent assaults on Lebanon and Syria. “But if Hezbollah decides it needs to, to preserve its political position, Tehran can’t veto.” He also suggested that Tehran may see some of its allied groups in Iraq, which Larijani visited before Beirut, more favourably now, especially since the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad in December severed its land supply routes to Lebanon. A threat and a provocation Hezbollah has long been considered the most powerful nonstate armed actor in the Middle East, a valuable ally for Iran and a nemesis for Israel. “Hezbollah has always been a threat and a provocation, depending on where you’re standing,“ said Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and an authority on Hezbollah. “It’s still both, though to a much lesser degree,” he added, noting the damage the group sustained from Israel’s attacks and the assassinations of its leadership in the build-up to and during Israel’s war on Lebanon in October and November. Even relatively moderate figures within the group are comparing doing so to suicide.” Advertisement In his speech on Friday, Qassem’s rejection was unequivocal: “The resistance will not disarm so long as the aggression continues and the occupation persists. “If necessary, we will fight a Karbala’i battle to confront this Israeli-American project, no matter the costs, and we are certain we will win,” he said, referencing the Battle of Karbala, venerated by Shia Muslims as a foundational battle against tyranny and oppression. … It has a spotless record and does not want [this].” Inside the tent Larijani’s visit on Wednesday was seen as a potential opportunity for Beirut to open up new lines of communication with one of the region’s most significant actors, Tehran, and potentially determine what Iran might be willing to consider in return for Hezbollah’s future disarmament. “It’s not possible for Lebanon to break relations between the Shia community and Iran, any more than it could the Sunni community and Saudi Arabia,” Michael Young of the Carnegie Middle East Center said. You want Iranians inside the tent, not outside.” Given the precarity of Lebanon’s position, balanced between the US support it relies upon and the regional alliances it needs, Young suggested that Lebanese lawmakers nevertheless seek an opportunity to secure some sort of middle ground while accepting that some in Beirut may not be willing to countenance any negotiations with Iran. “It’s important for the Lebanese to see if there are openings in the Iranian position,” Young continued, casting Larijani’s visit as a potential opportunity for the Lebanese government to influence Iran’s position on Hezbollah’s future. “And this is something Larijani’s visit, if well exploited, could provide,” he said, “It’s important for the Lebanese to see if the Iranians propose anything in the future or if they show a willingness to compromise on behalf of Hezbollah.”

Article: Delegates at a closing meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) in Geneva on Friday spoke of their dismay at the failure to break a deadlock at the sixth round of talks in under three years, as countries remained deeply divided over the scope of any treaty. “The planet, and present and future generations need this treaty.” Landmark treaty sought More than 1,000 delegates from at least 180 countries had gathered in the Swiss city for the latest meeting of the INC, a group established by the United Nations Environment Assembly in 2022 with the mandate to develop the world’s first legally binding global treaty to tackle plastic pollution. The negotiations in Geneva were intended to be the last round of talks that would produce a deal – although the same was said of the previous round of talks held in Busan, South Korea, late last year. Delegates had been working to a deadline of Thursday to reach a deal, and held frantic last-minute negotiations into the early hours of Friday to try to strike common ground before talks collapsed. Advertisement The so-called High Ambition Coalition, a large informal bloc which includes the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as many Latin American and African countries, has pushed for the treaty to introduce curbs on plastic production and the phasing out of toxic chemicals. But a camp of oil-producing states calling itself the Like-Minded Group – including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia – argues that the treaty should be much more limited in scope. Luis Vayas Valdivieso, chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of a treaty text, but the delegates did not agree on either as the basis for negotiations. Anger and disappointment France’s Ecological Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said she was “angry” and “disappointed” by the outcome, the AFP news agency reported, adding that a small number of countries “guided by short-term financial interests” had stood in the way of an important treaty. “It is unjust for [our countries] to face the brunt of yet another global environmental crisis we contribute minimally to.” The next steps for the negotiations were not immediately clear.

Article: A Michigan autoworker's wallet is found under a hood in Minnesota - 151,000 miles later A retired Michigan autoworker looked at a Facebook message after midnight from a stranger: Did you lose your wallet years ago? "If so," a Minnesota man wrote, "it was in the engine bay of a car." Richard Guilford couldn't believe what he was reading on his phone - a decade-old mystery was remarkably solved. Guilford's tri-fold leather wallet - stuffed with $15, a driver's license, work ID, gift cards worth $275 and lottery tickets - had turned up under the hood of a car in a repair shop in Lake Crystal, Minnesota. The filter box wouldn't snap in place after a repair, he said, "so I messed around a little bit and then pulled it back out and the wallet was sitting on a little ledge where it needed to snap down. He was certain he had lost it in a car, but figured it was on the floor of a Ford Flex, not an Edge, and certainly not in the engine. Guilford said he searched 30 to 40 cars, and his co-workers looked at dozens more, "just opening the doors up, looking under the seats, looking behind it." "I can't take too much time to look for this because I gotta work. That's incredible." Ford spokesperson Said Deep called it a "repair that's right on the money," adding: "Can you imagine the odds?" Cabela's, an outdoor retailer, said the $250 in gift cards remain valid, but it has offered to give him new cards anyway.

Article: Sturgeon book reignites trans row with JK Rowling 1 hour ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save Getty Images Harry Potter author JK Rowling has posted a review of Nicola Sturgeon's memoir JK Rowling has hit back at Nicola Sturgeon after the former Scottish first minister's memoir reignited their long-running row over gender. In the book, Sturgeon said she had endured a surge of "vile" abuse after Rowling posted a selfie in a T-shirt with the slogan: "Nicola Sturgeon, destroyer of women's rights". Getty Images The former first minister's memoir, Frankly, was released on Thursday Sturgeon, the MSP for Glasgow Southside, had previously told the BBC's Newscast podcast that the Harry Potter author had every right to disagree with her but that the T-shirt "seemed to me quite incendiary". The pair - arguably the most prominent public figures in Scotland - have long disagreed about politics, with Rowling critical of the former Scottish National Party leader's attempt to legislate to make it easier to legally change gender. The campaigners, supported by Rowling, have since won a landmark case in London when the UK Supreme Court ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. JK Rowling JK Rowling posted a selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Sturgeon as a "destroyer of women's rights" Sturgeon says she stands by the principle that an individual has the right to self-identify in the gender of their choosing. However she has also expressed regret that she did not pause the Holyrood gender self-ID bill, in order to seek common ground between supporters and critics, when the issue became mired in "rancour and division". Rowling is unimpressed, writing on her website that Sturgeon "caused real, lasting harm" by presiding over a culture in which women who did not subscribe to her "luxury beliefs" were "silenced, shamed, persecuted" and placed in degrading and unsafe situations. The comments echoed language she had used in an interview with The News Agents podcast in 2023 when she said that some opponents of the SNP's gender reforms were "deeply misogynist, often homophobic, possibly some of them racist as well". Rowling describes that as Sturgeon's "basket of deplorables" moment, a reference to Hillary Clinton's disastrous dismissal of half of her rival Donald Trump's supporters as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic and Islamophobic.

Article: KHARKIV, Ukraine — Even as his family sobbed into the dirt of his brother’s grave, Ukrainian soldier Artem Reshetilov warned President Donald Trump that he should not compromise with Russia during Friday’s peace talks in Alaska. At the funeral on the eve of the talks in Anchorage — to which Ukraine has not been invited — Reshetilov urged Trump not to bend to Vladimir Putin’s demands of more Ukrainian land. “We don’t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won’t stop,” said Reshetilov, 46, as hundreds of Ukrainian flags, each marking the grave of a fallen soldier, flapped in the breeze behind him at this cemetery near the major northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ted Turner / NBC News Like many who will not be present in Anchorage, he told NBC News he fears Russia could merely use a ceasefire to “return even stronger” and attack Ukraine and even other countries in Europe. These fears are not confined just to Ukrainian hearts but shared by governments, experts and people across Europe and beyond who fear what Trump might agree with Putin in a bid to resolve a war he once promised the American people he could fix in 24 hours. Follow live updates here Alarmed at being frozen out of the talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government this week turned to European leaders for a lifeline, hoping to influence the high-stakes summit and prevent a potential disaster for Ukraine. A flurry of diplomacy culminated with a Wednesday emergency video call between Trump, Zelenskyy, and leaders from Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and NATO, all of whom urged the American president not to capitulate to Putin. “The Ukrainians and the Europeans were all worried that Trump and Putin would get together and make some decisions for Ukraine.” Zelenskyy was in London on Thursday meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “We all are preparing ourselves for an outcome that may be highly problematic,” said one European official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks. Asked for a response to these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News to statements Trump has made this week saying that it would be up to Ukraine and Russia to make a deal between them, and that this meeting was merely a “listening exercise” that could lead to an eventual summit between the warring leaders. Trump said Thursday that Putin was “not going to mess around with me,” but added that he “will be very proud to end this war” along with several others he claims to have helped resolve, calling himself the “peacemaker-in-chief.” What’s caused the most consternation in Ukraine is Trump’s repeated suggestions that he could negotiate a “land swap” between Russia and Ukraine, having previously suggested it would be unrealistic for Ukrainians to expect the return of lands illegally invaded and currently occupied by Russia. The American president told European leaders this week that he would not discuss territory divisions during his sit-down with Putin, two European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News. “But why does the United States, which positions itself as a state that values the rule of law,” she asked, want to take part in what she calls a “circus?” Putin has said he is ready for peace — but only if Ukraine essentially surrenders.

Article: Putin enters talks with Trump from a position of strength Russian President Vladimir Putin may already feel like a winner when he sits down Friday in Alaska with his American counterpart Donald Trump. The two are set to meet at a military base in Anchorage to discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine, in a high-stakes summit that marks the first time Putin will set foot on American soil in a decade and his first meeting with Trump since 2019. In Moscow, there was a sense of confidence in Putin, though Pavek Grbenyuk, a 45-year-old who said he worked at a window manufacturing factory, told NBC News that he thought it was “unlikely anything will change dramatically.” Trump — who is looking to cement his legacy as a “peacemaker” and win a Nobel Peace Prize — told European leaders that his goal is to secure a ceasefire and that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory. While Putin claims four Ukrainian territories — Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. In Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, soldier Artem Reshetilov, 46, urged Trump not to bend to Putin’s demands: “We don’t have to compromise with the enemy and give up our beloved land because this enemy won’t stop,” Reshetilov said at the funeral of his brother Andrei, 38, killed by a Russian artillery strike while fighting to defend Ukraine’s frontlines. In an interview on Fox News, Bondi previewed an order by the Justice Department naming DEA head Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner” of the Metropolitan Police Department, days after Trump directed the federal government to take control of the local police and deployed the National Guard in an effort to mitigate crime in the nation’s capital. Trump called the order a “great step” and suggested the initiative could be something that “could happen all over the country.” Meanwhile, a homeless encampment near the Kennedy Center, for which Trump serves as a chairman, was dismantled by city workers who shoved people’s belongings into garbage trucks.

Article: 'Tell someone about abuse' urges victim of prolific catfishing sex offender 12 hours ago Share Save Niall McCracken, Cormac Campbell and Claire Brennan BBC News NI Share Save PSNI / BBC Max Hollingsbee exhibited an addiction to power, control and sexual satisfaction, a court was told A teenager who was catfished by a prolific sex offender has urged other young victims not to be "embarrassed" and to tell someone they trust about the abuse. Figures released to BBC News NI though a Freedom of Information request show the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) made 478 arrests for sexual communication with a child between 2019 and 2024. According to PSNI Det Supt Jordan Piper "groomers like McCartney and Hollingsbee operate in a very similar way, concealing their identity online and pretending to be the same age as a child". "They use fake profile pictures, pretending to have similar interests to gain the trust of the child before steering the conversation to a sexual nature." PSNI / BBC Alexander McCartney is serving at least 20 years in prison after being convicted in what was described as the UK's largest catfishing case Prosecutors said the availability of social media means the stereotypical image of a child sex offender is changing. Catherine Kierans, assistant director of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), said there had been a number of cases involving young males abusing children and young people online and that "trend seems to be continuing". "People have this image of paedophiles being creepy older men, but we are seeing younger and younger male offenders, perhaps because they have computer skills to follow through with their impulses." Ms Kierans urged parents to monitor their children's internet habits. All were teenagers when they began seeking out younger victims, many of the children they targeted lived abroad and they also used popular social media apps to find and abuse victims, including Snapchat and Wizz. Getty Images Abusers make fake accounts on online platforms to entrap and manipulate young poeple, police say Marcella Leonard, an expert in the assessment and treatment of sexual trauma, said this type of offending has evolved over time. "But also when an image is being taken of that, they think about: 'Where is that photograph, who has got that, how many copies have been made?'" Immy was diagnosed with anxiety after her experience with Hollingsbee and missed out on school during her GCSE year. "Three or four years ago, it would have been mostly secondary schools." Mr Denner said abusers use online games, such as Roblox, Minecraft and Fortnite, as well as messaging apps, with more children "getting access to technology from a younger age".

Article: Iraq was plunged into a nationwide blackout earlier this week, as a temperature surge to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50° Celcius) — and subsequent spiking demand for electricity — pushed the country's faltering power grid to the breaking point. Blackouts have nevertheless become a common occurrence in the country's scorching summers, and shorter power cuts take place almost daily, with many Iraqis depending on private generators for reliable power — while those without that access are left to suffer. The Iraqi government has struggled to provide its citizens with reliable energy since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, after which the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime and the ensuing turmoil left the national grid unable to cope with demand due to chronic under-investment, mismanagement and corruption — like the embezzlement of public funds intended for electricity projects. This spilled into civil unrest in the summer of 2021, when hundreds of Iraqis took to the streets amid power and water outages gripped large parts of the country, And just in July, power cuts sparked fresh protests across the country against a backdrop of extreme heat. Iran reliance and gas flaring Iraq relies heavily on neighboring Iran for gas and power: in 2023, 47% of the gas Iraq consumed came from Iran and produced an estimated 29% of Iraqi power generation. But the Iranian gas supply is also unreliable — in part because Iran often has trouble keeping its own lights on, due to sanctions and mismanagement, and because Tehran at times withholds its exports to Iraq for political reasons. It's a supply and demand problem as a growing and richer population demands electricity the state cannot supply," James Jeffrey, a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute who previously served as the U.S. "Iran wants to keep selling billions in gas and electricity to Baghdad and also wants Iraq dependent on Tehran." Sanctions pressure In March, the Trump administration – as part of its maximum-pressure sanctions strategy against Iran – rescinded the waiver that Washington has historically granted Iraq to continue buying Iranian electricity without breaching U.S. The move means Iraq can no longer import Iranian electricity – which comprises about 3% or Iraq's power supply, according to Platts reporting – but Baghdad can still import Iranian gas, which provides the much larger part of its power. "Iraq will gain energy independence, bolstering the authority of its central government — which Iran has exploited with its cheap energy for too long," Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington D.C., wrote in a report published in March. "The hard part now is ensuring that Tehran cannot continue exploiting Baghdad's political environment and that the government finds reliable energy alternatives." Power projects underway A number of major projects are underway to improve Iraq's energy independence. TotalEnergies' $27 billion Gas Growth Integrated Project, signed in 2023, aims to capture some of Iraq's flared gas for use in power plants and build a 1-1.25 gigawatt solar park for the southern city of Basra. For reference, the current capacity of Iraq's national grid is less than 28 gigawatts, compared to a peak demand of 48 gigawatts, according to Jessica Obeid, head of Energy Transitions at SRMG Think.

Article: Bondi names DEA head as DC's 'emergency police commissioner,' but capital leaders push back Bondi said in a directive that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." Bondi said in a directive that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." Bondi said in a directive that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." Bondi said in a directive that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's "emergency police commissioner" with all the powers of the police chief - a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." The Metropolitan Police Department "must receive approval from Commissioner Cole" before issuing any orders, Bondi said. "Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor," Schwalb wrote in a memo to Smith, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that "there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official." Bondi's directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody - such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of "sanctuary policies." Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. Another expansion of federal authority The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement. Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said. A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable - and highly visible - uptick in presence from the previous two days. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said. "They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital," Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. "The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training." Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are "protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence." Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a "very small force" of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown. For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies.

Article: No rescue for UK bioethanol industry facing collapse The government said it worked closely with the companies since June, but had decided not to provide them with taxpayer funds "in the national interest". The country's two major producers, Hull-based Vivergo Fuels and the Ensus plant in Redcar on Teesside, have both warned that without government support they will be forced to close, after a deal to allow US ethanol to be imported tariff-free. "In making this decision, the government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber, a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world." It said jobs in clean energy would now move overseas. The bioethanol industry buys thousands of tonnes of wheat from UK farms, and Ensus also produces 30% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide – used in soft drinks, medical and nuclear industries.

Article: President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia’s gains, block Kyiv’s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit also deals a heavy blow to the West’s policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine’s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting, a possibility that Russia hasn’t agreed to. When asked in Anchorage about Trump’s estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.” “We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his meeting goals In the days leading up to the summit, set for a military base near Anchorage, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he’s also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He’s not going to mess around with me.” Trump’s repeated suggestions that a deal would likely involve “some swapping of territories” — which disappointed Ukraine and European allies — along with his controversial history with Putin have some skeptical about what kind of agreement can be reached. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said he sees “no upside for the U.S., only an upside for Putin.” “The best that can happen is nothing, and the worst that can happen is that Putin entices Trump into putting more pressure on Zelenskyy,” Kelly said. George Beebe, the former director of the CIA’s Russia analysis team who is now affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said there’s a serious risk of blown expectations or misunderstandings for a high-level summit pulled together so quickly. “That said, I doubt President Trump would be going into a meeting like this unless there had been enough work done behind the scenes for him to feel that there is a decent chance that something concrete will come out of it,” Beebe said. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe’s position as the toughest enemy of Russia.” The summit could have far-reaching implications On his way to Anchorage Thursday, Putin arrived in Magadan in Russia’s Far East, according to Russian state news agency Interfax. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visit would include meetings with the regional governor and stops at several key sites, including a stop to lay flowers at a WWII-era memorial honoring Soviet-American aviation cooperation. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia’s much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump’s posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” “Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is also a former senior intelligence officer. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit’s venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.” Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location.

Akhundzada, who is seldom seen in public, said in a statement that Afghans had endured hardships and made sacrifices for almost 50 years so that Islamic law, or Sharia, could be established. “If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty.” He also instructed the Cabinet and ministers to drop the word “acting” from their job titles, signifying the permanence of a Taliban administration in Afghanistan and the lack of challengers to their rule. He urged the promotion of religious awareness, the discouragement of immoral conduct, the protection of citizens from harmful ideologies, and the instruction of Afghans in matters of faith and creed, according to a statement from another government spokesman, Hamdullah Fitrat. Afghan women held up signs that said “Forgiving the Taliban is an act of enmity against humanity” and “August 15th is a dark day.” The women were fully veiled, except for their eyes, in the photographs.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy -- CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) — Pope Leo XIV prayed Friday for a peaceful end to the “increasingly deafening violence” of wars around the world as he celebrated a Catholic feast day on the same day as a high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit over the war in Ukraine. Unfortunately, even today, we feel powerless in the face of the spread of increasingly deafening violence, insensitive to any movement of humanity.” The pope prayed for hope for a peaceful future. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, prayed for a successful outcome of the U.S.-Russia summit during a visit to the Turkish island of Gokceada, home to an ethnic Greek community and his birthplace. “Enlighten the leaders who will meet tomorrow in Alaska, that they may bring peace to the world, end these murderous wars, stop the shedding of blood, let reason prevail, and let justice and mutual respect reign throughout the world,” Bartholomew said Thursday. He has spent a chunk of the summer at the estate, extending now for the second time his vacation to take advantage of the quiet and relatively cooler calm of the property overlooking Lake Alban. Leo had spoken by telephone with Putin on June 4 and, according to the Vatican, “urged Russia to make a gesture that would promote peace, emphasizing the importance of dialogue for establishing positive contacts between the parties and seeking solutions to the conflict.” Upon arrival in Castel Gandolfo earlier this week, Leo told reporters that he hoped the Trump-Putin summit would produce at least a cease-fire, saying the war had gone on for too long with too many dead, and no end in sight. He is scheduled to return to the Vatican on Tuesday, closing out a six-week vacation period punctuated by spells back at the Vatican, most significantly to preside over the 1-million strong Holy Year celebration for young people earlier this month.

At the Royal Courts of Justice earlier, lawyers for Epping Forest District Council urged a judge to grant an injunction against the owner of The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, to stop it from housing migrants on behalf of the Home Office. Philip Coppel KC, representing the authority, said: "The protests have unfortunately been attended by violence and disorder." Mr Justice Eyre is hearing submissions from the hotel's owners into Friday afternoon and it is not clear at this stage when he will rule on the injunction. Mr Coppel added: "Epping Forest District Council comes to this court seeking an injunction because it has a very serious problem." "There has been what can be described as an increase in community tension, the catalyst of which has been the use of The Bell Hotel to place asylum seekers," he said. PA Media Hundreds of protesters have attended demonstrations at The Bell Hotel during the summer Mr Coppel said that the defendant, Somani Hotels Limited, "did not advise or notify the local planning authority" to seek their views on the use of the site. Lawyers representing Somani Hotels, the owner of the premises, told the court that an injunction would cause asylum seekers "hardship" and that the move would set "a dangerous precedent that protests justify planning injunctions".

Article: CHOSITI, India (AP) — Flash floods triggered by torrential rains have killed at least 176 people and left scores others missing in India and Pakistan over the past 24 hours, officials said Friday, as rescuers brought to safety some 1,600 people from two mountainous districts in the neighboring countries. Dozens missing in remote Himalayan village In India-controlled Kashmir, rescuers searched for missing people in the remote Himalayan village of Chositi on Friday after flash floods a day earlier left at least 60 people dead and at least 80 missing, officials said. Chositi, in Kashmir’s Kishtwar district, is the last village accessible to motor vehicles on the route of an ongoing annual Hindu pilgrimage to a mountainous shrine at an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,500 feet.) Officials said the pilgrimage, which began July 25 and was scheduled to end on Sept. More than 200 pilgrims were in the kitchen at the time of the flood, which also damaged or washed away many of the homes clustered together in the foothills, officials said. Authorities made makeshift bridges Friday to help stranded pilgrims cross a muddy water channel and used dozens of earthmovers to shift boulders, uprooted trees and electricity poles and other debris. Hundreds of tourists trapped by floods in Pakistan In northern and northwestern Pakistan, flash floods killed at least 116 people while rescuers evacuated 1,300 stranded tourists from a mountainous district hit by landslides. Flash floods triggered by heavy rains and cloudbursts early Friday killed at least 56 people in Buner district in Pakistan’s northwestern district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a government administrator said. Bilal Faizi, a provincial emergency service spokesman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said rescuers worked for hours to save 1,300 tourists after they were trapped by flash flooding and landslides in the Siran Valley in Mansehra district on Thursday. The Gilgit-Baltistan region has been hit by multiple floods since July, triggering landslides along the Karakoram Highway, a key trade and travel route linking Pakistan and China that is used by tourists to travel to the scenic north. A study released this week by World Weather Attribution, a network of international scientists, found rainfall in Pakistan from June 24 to July 23 was 10% to 15% heavier because of global warming.

Article: TOKYO (AP) — Japan is paying tribute to more than 3 million war dead as the country marks its surrender 80 years ago, ending World War II, as concern grows about the rapidly fading memories of the tragedy of war and the bitter lessons from the era of Japanese militarism. “Once again, we must deeply keep to our hearts the remorse and lesson from that war.” He vowed to keep passing down the tragedy of war and peace pledge to next generations. In a national ceremony Friday at Tokyo’s Budokan hall, about 4,500 officials and bereaved families and their descendants from around the country observed a moment of silence at noon, the time when the then-emperor’s surrender speech began on Aug. Aisawa vowed to “pass down the historical facts of war to future generations.” Separately, Sohei Kamiya, head of the populist far-right Sanseito, came with 17 parliamentarians and 70 local assembly members from his party and said he prayed for the war dead. Emperor shows ‘deep remorse’ and stresses importance to keep telling the war’s tragedy Japanese emperors have stopped visiting the Yasukuni site since the enshrinement of top war criminals there in 1978. Emperor Naruhito, in his address at the Budokan memorial Friday, expressed his hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated while “reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse.” Naruhito reiterated the importance of telling the war’s tragic history and the ordeals faced during and after the conflict to younger generations as “we continue to seek the peace and happiness of the people in the future.” As part of the 80th anniversary, he has traveled to Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Hiroshima, and is expected to visit Nagasaki with his daughter, Princess Aiko, in September. Passing on history to younger generations amid revisionism Hajime Eda, whose father died on his way home from Korea when his ship was hit by a mine, said he will never forget his father and others who never made it home. In his speech representing the bereaved families, Eda said it is Japan’s responsibility to share the lesson — the emptiness of the conflict, the difficulty of reconstruction and the preciousness of peace. Among them, Ami Tashiro, a 15-year-old high school student from Hiroshima, said she joined a memorial marking the end of the battle on Iwo Jima last year after reading a letter her great-grandfather sent from the island. In an editorial Friday, the Mainichi newspaper noted that Japan’s pacifist principle was mostly about staying out of global conflict, rather than thinking how to make peace, and called the country to work together with Asian neighbors as equal partners.

Article: Howe is desperate to keep Isak, who helped the Magpies end their 56-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup final against Liverpool last season while also firing them to Champions League qualification. Asked if he envisioned Isak playing for Newcastle before the end of the summer transfer window, Howe told reporters on Friday: “As I sit here now, I don’t know that. Alex will control that.” Isak is reportedly refusing to train or play in an effort to force his way out of the club he joined from Real Sociedad in 2022. Isak has three years remaining on his Newcastle contract, and it is understood he will be fined – the maximum penalty for a single offence is two weeks wages – for missing a competitive match this weekend. Liverpool manager Arne Slot has hinted the Reds will submit a second offer – their initial bid was 40 million pounds ($54m) shy of Newcastle’s valuation – but Howe is confident there is a way back for the player should no deal be struck. “It’s not in my hands, but he’s contracted to us, so that’s why I say that.” Isak’s stance has angered Newcastle fans, and Howe hopes the striker realises how important the club has been in his development. “This is a different moment for him and us, and we’re working through that together.” Howe said he is also focused on strengthening Newcastle’s squad, regardless of Isak’s transfer status. I can’t deny that, but we’re still actively looking, and I still believe that there is someone there that can fit our requirements,” said Howe, who failed in approaches for Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Joao Pedro.

Isabel Martínez, manager of the social services program at the Tahirih Justice Center, focused on helping victims of gender-based violence, said women fear that “not only will nothing happen to the abuser, but now I will have to be deported, or be detained, or get into trouble if I call the police.” Since January, Martínez said, women have told her organization that they’d decided they couldn’t call the police and were too afraid to call the group because they feared it would have to call the police and report the abuse. “They’re thinking twice about reporting.” Though women represent 84% of victims of spousal abuse and 86% of victims of intimate partner abuse, according to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Statistics, anyone can be a victim of abuse, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation or national origin. In a national survey released by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors this June, 76% of immigrant advocates reported that victims of domestic violence were afraid to call the police for fear of ICE. hospital emergency departments (one in San Francisco and one in Oakland, California) found almost 1 in 5 (19%) domestic violence victims avoided going to the police for fear that the police would report them to immigration authorities. Francesco Duberli, CEO and founder of Survivors Pathway, a Miami-based center that offers counseling and legal help for survivors of domestic violence, sexual abuse and human trafficking, said that “what we’re seeing is an exaggerated, and also very sad, increase in the psychological aspect of being terrified of immigration authorities.” ICE reopened the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office, created during Trump’s first administration. Under one of the “frequently asked questions,” it states that it “provides releasable information to all victims of crime with a nexus to immigration, regardless of the immigration status of the victim.” Noticias Telemundo contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security about the office, but didn’t receive a response. A failure to report domestic abuse can have fatal consequences: More than 50% of homicides committed by intimate partners were preceded by violence, and in cases where the victim is a woman, the figure rises to 75%, according to studies by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Houston, an immigrant woman who is not being identified because she fears reprisals told Noticias Telemundo of a November 2024 incident in which she felt her life was in danger. Immigrant victims' challenges, risks Certain factors make it hard for immigrant victims of domestic violence to leave or report their abusive situations, including being financially dependent on their abuser and having children who depend on them. And you say, ‘How could such a little person know I’m sick?’” Leaving a partner and filing a complaint with the court system “requires reflection and asking, ‘What’s going to happen next? Of the women who sought legal assistance after experiencing intimate partner violence, 85% lived at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to a 2024 study by the University of Cambridge. A key factor, according to therapists, is victims’ self-esteem: As the Texas immigrant woman described it, “Feeling like you’re nobody” as psychological abuse escalates, with taunts like “What are you going to do without me?” and “How are you going to get ahead?” she said. Some immigrants face greater risk if they rely on an abusive spouse to obtain legal status, as the American Immigration Council (AIC) has stated on its website, since abusers can use immigration status as a “tool to silence their victims” and may delay, withdraw or fail to file petitions for their relatives or threaten to report them to authorities. Emergency exits: The U visa and the VAWA petition For victims of violent crimes such as domestic abuse who can demonstrate cooperation with authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the crime, there is the U visa. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently told Noticias Telemundo that “a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.” Duberli said victims can also file a petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).

Article: NFL teams will again stencil messages in the end zone, including 'End Racism' and 'Choose Love' The NFL is continuing its on-field social justice messaging for a sixth straight season. All 32 teams will feature an end zone message of their choice at each home game throughout the season, selecting from four options: "End Racism," "Stop Hate," "Choose Love," or "Inspire Change." Once again, "It Takes All of Us" will be stenciled in the opposite end zone for all games. The only change from 2024 is that "Inspire Change" replaces "Vote." The Atlanta Falcons warm up in the endzone prior to an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers, Oct. AP Photo/Stew Milne, File These messages will complement the league's other cause campaigns such as Salute to Service and Crucial Catch, which will also appear in end zones during select weeks this season. "We're working hand-in-hand with players, and alongside our clubs, to amplify player voices and underscore what is most important to them," Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility, told The Associated Press. "For decades, the NFL and its players have been a unifying force in American culture and society that brings people of all cultures and backgrounds together to enjoy America's most popular sport. "This is an honor and responsibility that the league takes seriously, which is why we actively invest in off-field programs and on-field initiatives that promote unity." The league will use "End Racism" along with "It Takes All of Us" in the back of end zones for all international games for the second straight season. "It has become a unifying message of healing and hope, one that many players continue to wear voluntarily on helmet decals." Players will again have the option to display one of the five messages on their helmets this season. Since 2017, the NFL has provided more than $460 million to dozens of grant partners and hundreds of grassroots organizations through its Inspire Change initiative, helping benefit communities in need.

Article: Far-right Israeli minister taunts prominent Palestinian prisoner A screenshot from the video of the interaction, posted on Ben Gvir's X account Israel's national security minister, Ben Gvir tells him: "You will not win. Its Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh described it as "the epitome of psychological, moral and physical terrorism." New footage shared on social media shows the far-right Israeli minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, taunting the most prominent Palestinian prisoner, Marwan Barghouti in his cell. As Barghouti tries to interject, Ben Gvir adds: "You need to know this, throughout history." Marwan Barghouti, 66, was jailed by Israel more than 20 years ago after he was convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed. Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders. The minister says that having read how "all sorts of "senior officials"" in the PA did not like what he said, he will "repeat it again and again without apologising." Palestinian prisoner rights organisations say that Barghouti has been placed in solitary confinement since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. In response to the new video, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, Abdullah al-Zaghari accused Israel of seeking "to eliminate him and assassinate the leaders languishing in its prisons." Barghouti is one of the prisoners whose release Hamas is believed to have sought as part of an exchange deal for the remaining hostages it is holding. In the video, as Ben Gvir speaks, Barghouti – who is fluent in Hebrew – can be seen nodding and trying to break in, but the short clip ends before he does.

READ MORE: Russia becomes 1st country to formally recognize Taliban’s latest rule in Afghanistan Akhundzada, who is seldom seen in public, said in a statement that Afghans had endured hardships and made sacrifices for almost 50 years so that Islamic law, or Sharia, could be established. “If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty.” He also instructed the Cabinet and ministers to drop the word “acting” from their job titles, signifying the permanence of a Taliban administration in Afghanistan and the lack of challengers to their rule. He urged the promotion of religious awareness, the discouragement of immoral conduct, the protection of citizens from harmful ideologies, and the instruction of Afghans in matters of faith and creed, according to a statement from another government spokesman, Hamdullah Fitrat.

Article: CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) — Pope Leo XIV prayed Friday for a peaceful end to the “increasingly deafening violence” of wars around the world as he celebrated a Catholic feast day on the same day as a high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit over the war in Ukraine. Unfortunately, even today, we feel powerless in the face of the spread of increasingly deafening violence, insensitive to any movement of humanity.” The pope prayed for hope for a peaceful future. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, prayed for a successful outcome of the U.S.-Russia summit during a visit to the Turkish island of Gokceada, home to an ethnic Greek community and his birthplace. “Enlighten the leaders who will meet tomorrow in Alaska, that they may bring peace to the world, end these murderous wars, stop the shedding of blood, let reason prevail, and let justice and mutual respect reign throughout the world,” Bartholomew said Thursday. He has spent a chunk of the summer at the estate, extending now for the second time his vacation to take advantage of the quiet and relatively cooler calm of the property overlooking Lake Alban. Leo had spoken by telephone with Putin on June 4 and, according to the Vatican, “urged Russia to make a gesture that would promote peace, emphasizing the importance of dialogue for establishing positive contacts between the parties and seeking solutions to the conflict.” Upon arrival in Castel Gandolfo earlier this week, Leo told reporters that he hoped the Trump-Putin summit would produce at least a cease-fire, saying the war had gone on for too long with too many dead, and no end in sight. He is scheduled to return to the Vatican on Tuesday, closing out a six-week vacation period punctuated by spells back at the Vatican, most significantly to preside over the 1-million strong Holy Year celebration for young people earlier this month.

Article: (She only makes a brief, off-screen cameo.) But even amid the criticism, "And Just Like That" continued to serve as a nostalgic reminder of the original magic of "Sex and the City," a show that has remained part of the zeitgeist despite ending more than two decades ago. "Even though I’ve complained a lot about this show, I’ve quite enjoyed the complaining," Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, author of the book "Sex and the City and Us," told NBC News in an email. It’s a way of knowing someone is your people right away." The original show, which ran for six seasons (from 1998 to 2004) on HBO, came to define a generation of viewers, particularly women who saw themselves in the quartet of female characters. It was based on the life and work of Candace Bushnell, who wrote a column for The New York Observer called "Sex and the City" and later a book of the same name. In addition to Carrie Bradshaw’s romantic escapades, "SATC" also centered around the female friendships Carrie had with PR queen/sex positive pal Samantha (Kim Cattrall), preppy art dealer/hopeless romantic Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), and feisty, cynical attorney Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon). "It was a formative show for at least a generation or two of women, one that gave us a new vision for what it meant to be single, independent, professional, and in your 30s," Armstrong said. "That was still new then, and it turned being a single woman from being sad to being glamorous." These women showed us that being a single woman meant nights on the town with your girlfriends, constant dishy sex talk at brunch, and a great wardrobe you bought yourself." -Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, author of the book "Sex and the City and Us" But why does it still resonate? "Now, we have so many shows where women are single and talk about sex and dating," said Eli Rallo, author of the upcoming book, "Does Anyone Else Feel This Way?" “But what Candace Bushnell and [showrunner] Michael Patrick King did for women in their 30s and beyond during the 90s and early 2000s was taste-making.” The "SATC" universe has continued to strike a chord with viewers "because the show did a perfect job of hitting the nail on the head of true women in their 30s," added Rallo, who has also been described as "Gen Z’s Carrie Bradshaw" by some of her 1 million plus followers on Instagram and TikTok. “And Just Like That" came after two “SATC” movies (released in 2008 and 2010, respectively) and a prequel series, "The Carrie Diaries" (which aired on the CW for two seasons from 2013-2014). While Rallo said she understands the criticism toward "And Just Like That," she described the spin-off as a "treat" because it served as an opportunity to see these characters "in a later stage in life." Throughout the 33 episodes of "And Just Like That," Carrie navigates the death of a loved one (Mr. Charlotte, still married to the love of her life, Harry Goldenblatt, returns to work as an art dealer while balancing being a mother to two teens (one who comes out as nonbinary). But there were some new additions to the spin-off crew, including: Charlotte's fellow working mom, Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker); Carrie's realtor-turned-friend, Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury); and Miranda's now-ex partner, stand-up comic Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez). In Thursday’s finale of "And Just Like That," Carrie does the unexpected for a character we've mainly seen entangled in the thralls of romance for the 27 years she's been onscreen. "The final shot ever is one for the books, sitting at her computer, window-shot, followed by song and dance," one TikTok user wrote in the text of their video about the finale, which featured a clip of the end scene. "You’ve got to be kidding me," one TikTok creator said in her reaction video, calling the finale "disrespectful." King said the decision to end the show came after he consulted with Parker, who serves as an executive producer, as well as Casey Bloys, HBO’s chief executive officer, and Sarah Aubrey, HBO’s head of original programming. "While I was writing the last episode of 'And Just Like That…' season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop," King wrote in his Aug. "I will always cherish this amazing experience and all of you," Nixon wrote in a post Thursday, giving a special shoutout to "all the undying fans of the show and the SATC universe." Davis also shared a goodbye post, writing, "... The symphony of all those emotions has been the greatest soundtrack and most consequential companion." In the comments, hundreds of people — including a handful of celebrities — shared their love for Parker and Carrie. But I think it's the respect and the affection that we feel for the experience in totality that leads you to a decision like this." Years ago, Parker said, she never would have expected to make "Sex and the City" movies, let alone a spin-off.

Article: King hails veterans' courage and sacrifice on VJ Day 10 minutes ago Share Save Alex Kleiderman BBC News Share Save Watch: Royals and veterans mark VJ Day 80 years on The King, Queen and prime minister have joined World War Two veterans for a remembrance service to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. Some 33 men now aged between 96 and 105, who served in military in the Far East and Pacific, were the guests of honour at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. VJ Day, or Victory over Japan Day, is commemorated on 15 August each year and marks the date in 1945 when Japan surrendered to Allied forces, bringing World War Two to an end after nearly six years. PA Media Sir Keir Starmer laid a wreath while the King and Queen watched on Actress Celia Imrie narrated the story of the war in the Far East at the service, as the experiences of those who took part in it were told in person and on screen. There was also a tribute from poet Sir Ben Okri focusing on the contributions of soldiers who had enlisted from countries in the British Commonwealth to fight in Burma (now Myanmar). Reuters King Charles spoke to veteran Yavar Abbas at the service PA Media Veteran Alfred Conway watched on as his great-grandchildren laid a wreath In a six-minute audio message released before the service, the King vowed that those who fought and died in the Pacific and Far East "shall never be forgotten". "For the millions of families gathered around their wireless sets, and for their loved ones still serving far from home, it was the message a battle-weary world had long prayed for," the King said. "Their experience reminds us that war's true cost extends beyond battlefields, touching every aspect of life - a tragedy all-too vividly demonstrated by conflicts around the world today." The King also acknowledged the "immense price" paid by the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where more than 200,000 people died as a result of the US atomic bombings in August 1945 - some from the immediate blast and others from radiation sickness and burns afterwards. The King added: "But in recalling so much suffering, we must not lose sight of how great was the cause and how sweet the victory." He also cited the collaboration across faiths and cultural divides, saying: "Together they proved that, in times of war and in times of peace, the greatest weapons of all are not the arms you bear, but the arms you link. "That remains a vital lesson for our times." He said the "courage and camaraderie displayed in humanity's darkest hour is a flame that shall blaze for eternity - a beacon that honours our past and guides our future". The Prince and Princess of Wales also praised the "courage, sacrifice, and resilience" of those who fought in the Pacific and Far East in a message posted on social media, adding: "We owe an enduring debt to the generation who gave so much."

Article: Calls for review of law after Palestine Action arrests Separately, the Equality and Human Rights Commission has expressed concern about policing of demonstrations relating to events in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. Earlier this week, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the group was "not a non-violent organisation" and that she had made the decision to ban the group based on "clear security assessments". The Liberal Democrats have called for a review of the terrorism law used to arrest hundreds of supporters of the banned group Palestine Action, warning it risked having a "chilling effect" on free speech. "Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences." Writing to the home secretary and Met Police chief Mark Rowley , commission chair Baroness Kishwer Falkner said "we are concerned that some recent responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental rights". She said using the Terrorism Act to "arrest individuals exercising their right to peaceful protest this weekend sets a troubling precedent and risks having a chilling effect on both free speech and legitimate democratic dissent".

Article: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — The human ancestor fossil known as Lucy left Ethiopia for display in a European museum, Ethiopian national media reported Friday, citing Tourism Minister Selamawit Kassa. Lucy’s fragmented bones will be exhibited alongside Selam, the fossil of an Australopithecus baby that is about 100,000 years older than Lucy and was discovered in the same region 25 years later. “As an iconic specimen, she belongs to the whole world, so sharing her with the rest of humanity is something that everyone would love to see,” said Yohannes Haile-Selassie, Director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. candidate at the University of Warsaw, Poland, “She will also be exposed to different climate conditions, which could potentially have negative impacts on her preservation.” Even in Ethiopia, the public has only occasionally seen the real Lucy fossil. Bekele Reta, 43, a resident who lives just 50 meters (164 feet) from the museum where Lucy is housed, was unaware of Lucy’s departure until he saw it on social media. Early this year, the director general of the Czech National Museum, Michal Lukeš, in a statement announcing the exhibition of Lucy and Selam, expressed his appreciation of the Ethiopians for agreeing to “lend” the remains.

Article: The company recently suffered a string of setbacks , including a suspension of 2025 guidance , the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty and a Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing practices. The stock has now been cut more than half, a rare occurrence for a blue-chip, household name that has been a member of the coveted Dow Jones industrial Average since 2012. But the company will survive and likely regain its prominence in the industry," said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who has studied Buffett's methods for a long time. It has above average profitability and a below average price to earnings ratio." UNH 1Y bar UnitedHealth in the past 1-year period Shares of the insurer traded at a price-earnings ratio of just under 12 Thursday, near its lowest in more than a decade. In 2018, he, along with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon , launched a joint venture to improve health care for their employees and potentially for all Americans, but it was eventually shut down. "UNH sports an undeniably cheap valuation but it comes under the cloud of a government investigation and questions about reimbursement levels," said Bill Stone, Glenview Trust Company CIO and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. "Buffett is always interested in strong franchises that he thinks are dealing with surmountable short-term woes and that could be his view here." Long time horizon The size of Berkshire's stake — $1.5 billion — indicated to some that Buffett's two investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, were more responsible for this purchase rather than the "Oracle of Omaha" himself. What sets Berkshire apart from others is its buy-and-hold long-term approach, which could work to its advantage as UnitedHealth seeks to avert its crisis and regain public trust, according to George Hill, a healthcare analyst at Deutsche Bank. "While we believe that UNH shares appear attractively valued on a three-plus year time horizon, UNH's next two years could be very choppy from a membership, reimbursement and profitability perspective." UnitedHealth owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether.

Article: Israel’s announcement that it will illegally build thousands of homes in a highly controversial development in the occupied West Bank – in a move Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich boasted “buries the idea of a Palestinian state” – has drawn widespread international condemnation. Smotrich announced Thursday that he was pushing ahead with long-frozen plans for the E1 area settlement project that would connect occupied East Jerusalem with the existing illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, located several kilometres to the east. The planned settlement, which was shelved for years amid opposition from the United States and European allies, would comprise more than 3,400 homes for Israeli settlers on Palestinian-owned land that experts say is vital for any future territorially contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank. Palestine Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said the E1 development, in combination with the war in Gaza and escalating settler violence, would only lead to further escalation, tension and instability. Advertisement He said he held the US responsible for halting Israel’s expansionist actions, and noted that the settlement announcement came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had spoken of his vision for a “Greater Israel”. It considered the E1 settlement “a continuation of the occupation’s plans to undermine the opportunity to establish the Palestinian state on its homeland, weaken its geographical and demographic unity, entrench the division of the West Bank into isolated areas surrounded by a sea of settlements, and facilitate the completion of their annexation”. Qatar Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed the move, saying it “reaffirms Qatar’s unequivocal rejection of the Israeli occupation’s policies aimed at expanding settlements and forcibly displacing Palestinian people, measures intended to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state”. Statement | Qatar Condemns Israeli Finance Minister’s Approval of Settlement Plans Separating East Jerusalem from the Occupied West Bank#MOFAQatar pic.twitter.com/5BRIC3didA — Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Qatar (@MofaQatar_EN) August 14, 2025 Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry condemned the settlement plans “in the strongest possible terms”, saying they were a violation of international law and a serious threat to the possibility of a two-state solution. In a statement, it called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, protect the Palestinian people, and fulfil their legitimate rights, including recognition of the Palestinian state”. The ministry’s spokesman Sufyan Qudah affirmed his country’s “absolute rejection and condemnation of this settlement plan and the illegal Israeli measures that constitute a blatant violation of international law and international Security Council resolutions”. Qudah warned against the continued expansionist policy of the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which the ministry said “encourages the perpetuation of cycles of violence and conflict in the region”. Turkiye The Turkish Foreign Ministry said the settlement plan “disregards international law and United Nations resolutions” and “targets the territorial integrity of the State of Palestine, the basis for a two-state solution, and hopes for lasting peace”. “The UK strongly opposes the Israeli government’s E1 settlement plans, which would divide a future Palestinian state in two and mark a flagrant breach of international law,” he said in an emailed statement to the Reuters news agency. — David Lammy (@DavidLammy) August 14, 2025 Germany The German government, a strong supporter of Israel, urged Israel to “stop settlement construction” and said it “strongly rejects” the plan for the new development “The settlement construction violates international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Office in Berlin said. “Settlements go against international law … [and] further entrench the occupation.” European Union The European Union’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also slammed the plan as a “breach of international law” that would further undermine a two-state solution. “If implemented, settlement construction in this area will permanently cut the geographical and territorial contiguity between occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank and sever the connection between the northern and southern West Bank,” said Kallas. “The EU urges Israel to desist from taking this decision forward, noting its far-reaching implications and the need to consider action to protect the viability of the two-state solution.” She called on Israel to halt its settlement construction altogether, saying its settlement policy, combined with ongoing settler violence and military operations, were “fuelling an already tense situation on the ground and further eroding any possibility for peace”. Organisation of Islamic Cooperation The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) also denounced the plans, saying the Israeli occupation and settlement expansion were illegal under international law, United Nations resolutions, and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, and must end immediately. “There is a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to the terrible war in Gaza – the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel – and it will ultimately come.” United States Israel’s key ally, the United States, had no immediate words of criticism for the proposal. Asked about the settlement development, a spokesperson for the US State Department said Washington was focused on ending the war in Gaza and ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again. “A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Israeli government for further information.

Article: United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday in a bid to try and end Russia’s three-year assault on Ukraine. For their part, remarks from top Russian officials suggest that Moscow has tried to water down discussions about the war by linking them with other bilateral issues, particularly restoring economic ties with the US. He said that he believed the US was making “sincere efforts to stop the fighting, end the crisis and reach agreements of interest to all parties involved in this conflict”. “An exchange of views is expected on the further development of bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic sphere,” he said, pointing out that: “I would like to note that this cooperation has a huge and, unfortunately, untapped potential.” Ushakov also announced that in addition to Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s delegation in Alaska would also include the country’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s envoy on foreign investment and economic cooperation. By the time Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US – whose energy sector was transformed by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in the early 2000s – was already the world’s largest oil producer, at 11.9 million barrels of oil per day. During that time, China has supplied Russia with more high-end products – like advanced electronics and industrial machinery – while Moscow has solidified its position as a top supplier of oil and gas to Beijing. In March, Putin’s investment envoy – Kirill Dmitriev – claimed that Russia and the US had started talks on rare earth metals projects in Russia, and that some American companies had already expressed an interest in them. “Rare earth metals are an important area for cooperation, and, of course, we have begun discussions on various rare earth metals and (other) projects in Russia,” Dmitriev told the Izvestia newspaper. As such, the US has been pursuing minerals-for-security deals with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ukraine in recent months, in an effort to wrestle control of the global supply chain away from China. Since then, he has targeted India – the second biggest buyer of Russian oil – by doubling a 25 percent tariff on its goods to 50 percent, as a penalty for that trade with Moscow. Advertisement But he has suggested that Beijing could face such tariffs in the future, as the US tries to pressure countries to stop buying Russian crude, and thereby corner Putin into accepting a ceasefire. Meanwhile, lawmakers from both US political parties are pushing for a bill – the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 – that would also target countries buying Russian oil and gas.

Article: But the anti-incumbent play laid the groundwork for a far more ambitious effort six years later, when the governor responded to the Legislature’s failure to deliver taxpayer dollars for private school tuition — his top priority — by targeting 15 anti-voucher incumbents and unseating 11 of them. Abbott’s political zeal has been on full display lately as he moves to boot the Texas House Democratic leader from his duly elected office over the ongoing redistricting impasse, sparked by dozens of Democrats who left the state to stall a new GOP congressional map. This time we pulled out every tool in the toolbox.” As the quorum-breaking Democrats remain out of state in protest, Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court — an all-Republican body whose nine justices include six of his appointees — to vacate the seat of Houston Rep. Abbott has vowed to continue calling overtime legislative sessions, which only he has the authority to do, and threatened further retribution by targeting even more Democratic seats and suggesting he could add more conservative priorities to the already ambitious agenda, which he solely controls. People who have worked closely with the governor say it’s not that he is bolder now as much as that he has come into his leadership role — and rising national profile, thanks largely to Abbott’s boundary-pushing border initiatives under Operation Lone Star. Sending a message Shortly after President Joe Biden took office in 2021, Abbott criticized the Democratic administration's immigration policies and accused Biden of leaving the southern border “open” for migrants to cross. The idea scrambled the politics of immigration across the nation, as Democratic leaders struggled to respond to the influx of migrants needing help, while trying to appear supportive of immigrants’ rights. “What you're seeing is a governor who is probably more popular than he's ever been, a governor who has more political capital than he's ever had, and I think he's looking to push his advantage,” said John Wittman, who worked for Abbott, including as communications director, for seven years until 2021. Wittman was an aide to the governor — whom he described as “the hardest worker that I have ever met in my life” — when Abbott first stepped onto the House primary battlefield in 2017. “But the reality is that the governor sent a message that he was serious about his agenda.” Since then, Abbott has increasingly flexed his power, typically favoring blunt force methods over give-and-take deal-making to drive his agenda through the Legislature. In 2021, after state Democrats similarly fled the state to kill GOP voting restrictions, the governor vetoed the part of the state budget that funds the Legislature, declaring that “funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early.” The move threatened to withhold pay for more than 2,100 state employees caught in the middle, but lawmakers approved a stopgap measure extending the funding and Republicans ultimately passed the voting bill. The following session, Abbott went to work on his push for a school voucher program — a topic he had broached several years earlier, when he asked lawmakers during the 2017 session to create such a program for children with disabilities. As in 2017, Abbott’s renewed push to unlock public funds for private school tuition failed to clear the state House, meeting loud opposition from rural Republicans who argued the policy would reroute funding from public schools that are important pillars in their communities. His campaign unleashed ads accusing Republicans — including some he had openly supported in the past — of being soft on border security, even after they had voted to fund his border initiatives and pass a law to let Texas police arrest people suspected of being undocumented. “The nutshell bottom line is, policy is never divorced from politics,” said John Colyandro, who worked in various capacities for the governor dating back to his time as attorney general. “If you have an issue that you take on — that's a challenging issue like school choice — it was imperative for the governor to take that leadership role.” “Relic of a softer age” A prolific fundraiser, Abbott is sitting on an $86 million campaign stash and has already begun deploying it with ads against absent Democrats, knocking them for holding up disaster relief in the wake of Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 Texans.

Article: President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia’s gains, block Kyiv’s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit also deals a heavy blow to the West’s policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine’s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting, a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to. When asked in Anchorage about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.” "We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his meeting goals In the days leading up to the summit, set for a military base near Anchorage, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he's also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He’s not going to mess around with me.” Trump’s repeated suggestions that a deal would likely involve “some swapping of territories” — which disappointed Ukraine and European allies — along with his controversial history with Putin have some skeptical about what kind of agreement can be reached. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said he sees “no upside for the U.S., only an upside for Putin.” “The best that can happen is nothing, and the worst that can happen is that Putin entices Trump into putting more pressure on Zelenskyy,” Kelly said. George Beebe, the former director of the CIA’s Russia analysis team who is now affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said there’s a serious risk of blown expectations or misunderstandings for a high-level summit pulled together so quickly. “That said, I doubt President Trump would be going into a meeting like this unless there had been enough work done behind the scenes for him to feel that there is a decent chance that something concrete will come out of it,” Beebe said. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe’s position as the toughest enemy of Russia.” The summit could have far-reaching implications On his way to Anchorage Thursday, Putin arrived in Magadan in Russia’s Far East, according to Russian state news agency Interfax. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visit would include meetings with the regional governor and stops at several key sites, including a stop to lay flowers at a WWII-era memorial honoring Soviet-American aviation cooperation. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia’s much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” “Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is also a former senior intelligence officer. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit’s venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.” Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location.

Article: In a sample of nearly 500 registered Texans planning to vote in the Republican primary, Cornyn garnered 30% of the vote to Paxton’s 29% — well within the poll’s 4.4% margin of error. Groups affiliated with Senate Republicans have committed enormous resources to Cornyn, arguing that a Paxton candidacy would jeopardize the party’s hold on the seat and cost more money to defend. In a slideshow obtained by Punchbowl News, Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC linked to Senate GOP leadership, projected that Republicans would need to spend over $200 million on Paxton in a general election. But in a broader pool of 1,000 Texas voters, the Emerson poll found both Republicans beating Democrat Colin Allred — the highest-profile declared Democratic candidate — beyond the margin of error. Emerson, like many pollsters, underestimated Republicans in 2024, finding in October that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump led his Democratic counterpart, Kamala Harris, by 7 percentage points in Texas and that Allred was within 1 point of Sen. “Seven months ahead of the Republican Primary, the contest between the four-term incumbent and the Attorney General is a toss-up,” Emerson executive director Spencer Kimball said in a statement, noting the large share of voters who had yet to make up their minds. “Among these undecided voters, President Trump’s job approval stands at 73%, suggesting his endorsement could be pivotal in such a close race.” Beyond the Senate race, the poll found Trump’s approval rating remains much higher in Texas than nationally, with 49% approving of the job he’s done as president and 42% disapproving. Texans continued to rank the economy and immigration as their top issues, but their order has flipped since before the 2024 election, with the economy now taking the top spot at 30%. Amid Trump’s crackdown at the border, illegal crossings — which had already begun to drop under President Joe Biden after spiking earlier in his term — have plummeted to the lowest level in decades.

Bondi said in a directive that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." WASHINGTON -- The nation's capital challenged President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration stepped up its crackdown on policing by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, with all the powers of a police chief. SEE ALSO: Bondi names DEA head as DC's 'emergency police commissioner,' but capital leaders push back The lawsuit comes after Trump Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that Drug Enforcement Administration boss Terry Cole will assume "powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." The Metropolitan Police Department "must receive approval from Commissioner Cole" before issuing any orders, Bondi said. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, writing on social media that "there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official." Chief had agreed to share immigration information Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi's directive was "unlawful," arguing it could not be followed by the city's police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that "members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor," setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration. Bondi's directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of "sanctuary policies," which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Article: Kingsmill owner to buy Hovis to make UK bread giant Warburtons is the current market leader in UK breadmaking and the deal would need approval from the competition watchdog in order to go ahead. Sales of Kingsmill and Hovis loaves are thought to have fallen flat due to a drop in demand for basic pre-packaged bread, as speciality breads such as sourdough and ciabatta took a bigger slice of the market. It said the combined business would be "better placed to compete effectively" and to create new products "as a result of changing consumer tastes and needs." ABF's Allied Bakeries business, which makes Kingsmill and Allinson's bread, first confirmed talks over a potential deal three months ago. George Weston, chief executive of ABF said: "This solution will create value for shareholders, provide greater choice for consumers and increase efficiencies for customers." But Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: "While there is still a long way to go before any buyout happens, Hovis and Kingsmill must ensure that jobs are protected." She said Unite would be working to ensure the two brands fully involve the union in any decisions that impact its members.

Article: homes and apartments as homeowners and renters who want to harness the sun’s energy look for cheaper alternatives to rooftop installations Solar panels that fit on your balcony or deck are gaining traction in the US The app controller for a newly installed Craftstrom Solar plug-in kit is shown at the home of Bhavin Misra Tuesday, Aug. These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation. “It is clear that we are hitting a nerve — many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.” Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn't understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid. During the early days of plug-in solar's growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles. This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit. The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has "never had any pushback from any utility,” said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom. “This is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,” Oliver said, adding: “As this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better." ___ Associated Press video journalist Mingson Lau in Baltimore contributed to this report.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s capital challenged President Donald Trump’s takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration stepped up its crackdown on policing by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, with all the powers of a police chief. READ MORE: Trump’s DC rhetoric echoes history of racist narratives about urban crime The lawsuit comes after Trump Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that Drug Enforcement Administration boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Justice Department and White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the district’s lawsuit Friday morning. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration. Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Article: Just now Share Save Hazel Shearing • @hazelshearing Education correspondent Share Save Getty A record number of 18-year-olds woke up on Thursday morning to find they had got into their first choice of university. Those who didn't get a place, or wanted to switch, have had to keep cool heads amid cash incentives and offers of free accommodation from universities in the Clearing system. Dr Jo Saxton, the chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas), said universities were keen to enrol UK undergraduates this year - even if they missed their grades - because they offered financial "stability" at a time of "uncertainty" around international student numbers. It's higher even than it was in 2020 and 2021 when exams were cancelled and A-level results were based on teachers' assessments, leading to a surge in top grades and students getting into university. There are also more 18-year-olds in the population this year, which is why even though the proportion getting into their first choice of university has stayed the same, the actual number has grown. Tim Bradshaw, the chief executive of the prestigious Russell Group, said on Thursday that "many of our universities have courses available in Clearing" and that admissions teams were "ready to help students find the course that is right for them". With more students off to Russell Group and other highly selective universities next month, there's a smaller pool for the rest to recruit from - and that could have a knock-on impact on their finances. Students who sign up for "VIP" Clearing at the University of Gloucestershire have the chance to win a year of free accommodation - as advertised in a series of TikTok posts.

Article: 'About our lives, but without our voice': Sidelined Ukrainians look on 40 minutes ago Share Save Joel Gunter Reporting from Kyiv Share Save EPA Five thousand miles from Alaska, and feeling left out, Ukrainians were bracing themselves on Friday for the outcome of negotiations to which they were not invited. In Ukraine, where polls consistently show that about 95% of the population distrusts Putin, there is a uneasy mix of deep scepticism about the talks and deep fatigue with the war. That I and many others will lose all hope of return." The French President, Emmanuel Macron, said on Wednesday that Trump had agreed on a call with European leaders that no territorial concessions would be made without Ukraine's approval. There is great danger in that for us." Merezhko said he feared that, such was Trump's desire to be seen as a dealmaker, he may have privately made advance agreements with the Russians. "The question is, what could be in those agreements?" Various possibilities have been suggested for arrangements that could lead to a ceasefire, from a freezing of the current frontlines - with no formal recognition of the seized territory as Russian - to a maximalist position of Russia annexing four entire regions in eastern and southern Ukraine. Polls suggest that about 54% of Ukrainians support some form of land compromise in order to hasten the end of the war, but only with security guarantees from Ukraine's international partners. So deep and widespread is the distrust of Russia, that many believe an agreement to freeze the frontlines without security guarantees would simply be an invitation to Russia to rest, rearm, and reattack. "If we freeze the frontlines and cede territories it will only serve as a platform for a new offensive," said Volodymyr, a Ukrainian sniper serving in the east of the country. But this time, it would be the end of our country." Across Ukraine, people from all walks of life were making very tough decisions about the reality of their future, said Anton Grushetsky, the director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, which regularly polls the population about the war. But Ukrainians are showing us that they are flexible, they are telling us that they will accept various forms of security guarantees." According to the institute's polling, 75% of Ukrainians are totally opposed to giving Russia formal ownership of any territory. Among the remaining 25%, there were some people who were pro-Russian, Grushetsky said, and some who were simply so fatigued by the war that they felt hard compromises were necessary. She said she believed that three years into the war, with hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded on the Ukrainian side alone, the preservation of life superseded all concerns over land. "Not the youth, not the old people, not the civilians who live on the frontline." On Friday, as the clock ticked down to the beginning of the talks in Alaska, Ukrainians were celebrating a holy day - the day of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said Friday a mixed bag of inflation data this week coupled with lingering uncertainty over tariffs have given him some hesitation about lowering interest rates. "So I feel like we still need another one, at least, to figure out if we're if we're still on the golden path," Goolsbee said during a "Squawk Box" interview. The July consumer price index was relatively in line with market forecasts, though the core reading that excludes food and energy nudged higher to 3.1%, a bit above Wall Street expectations. While neither report showed significant obvious impacts, many economists believe the import duties President Donald Trump has imposed are slowly making their way into the data and will show up in coming months. I would be very comfortable that, hey, the dust is out of the air, it looks like we're still where we were, which is a strong economy with inflation coming back down," Goolsbee said. "We've got to get some clarity from the numbers." Markets are placing a near certainty that the FOMC votes to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point in September, from the current 4.25% to 4.50% level. However, there are some misgivings about what happens from there, with 55% odds of another reduction in October and just a 43% probability of a third move in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.

In its second year under coach Hansi Flick, the Catalan club will try to add to its success from last season by boosting its squad with Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United. Leaving the team are veteran defender Inigo Martínez, who has signed with Saudi club Al-Nassr, and Ansu Fati, who went on loan to Monaco after not playing much last season.

Article: The United States capital, Washington, DC, has challenged President Donald Trump’s takeover of its police department in court, hours after his administration stepped up its crackdown on policing by naming the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief, a federal official, as the new emergency head of the department, with all the powers of a police chief. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser also pushed back, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President. In… pic.twitter.com/XfaNqLalFU — Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) August 15, 2025 The lawsuit comes after Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Thursday night that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police”. “I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the news conference, in which he was joined by Bondi, who was initially set to oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control. Residents wary of escalated show of force A Washington population already on edge from days of Trump administration ramp-ups has begun witnessing more significant shows of force across the city. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he will re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Article: The artwork was Orlando’s response to make the community feel “comfortable and welcome and loved.” And in the aftermath of “a horrible, horrible situation … it did create this bond.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Across the state and the country, this and thousands of other brightly painted street crossings would be paved over under guidance recently issued by the administrations of Florida Gov. Advertisement The memo from the Florida Department of Transportation took a similar stance and warned city and county leaders that the state could withhold funding if they didn’t acquiesce: “This includes directing the removal of non-compliant traffic control devices and surface markings, including pavement art installations.” Jared Perdue, who heads the state agency, also raised the issue of autonomous vehicles, writing that “consistent application of pavement surfaces is critical” for them. A 2022 study by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization that funds street art projects, examined the crash history at 17 asphalt art sites across the country where there was a minimum of two years of crash statistics. “My thoughts are that this is political in nature and not directly related to traffic safety,” said Samuel Kaufman, a city commissioner in Key West, where a Duval Street intersection painted with rainbow crosswalks in 2015 quickly became a popular tourist draw. “City officials have checked all traffic incidents over many years, and there has not been a single reported traffic related incident related to the crosswalks.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Numerous cities in Florida have promoted street paintings as part of their culture. In Key West, according to Kaufman, the four rainbows at Duval and Petronia streets are “one of the most photographed areas on the island.” The commissioners there last week approved a proclamation declaring them “a treasured cultural district” — one way supporters hope to save them from being paved over. “It’s part of the identity of our community of being an inclusive place,” Kaufman said, “a place that welcomes all people, regardless of who you are.” Some Florida cities have already decided to return such crosswalks to standard asphalt rather than fight back. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In Orlando, the rainbow crosswalk shares the streets with other colorful asphalt decor — murals, rainbows, even swans on their way to the city’s main park, where a flock of live ones grace the small Lake Eola. “More importantly, it’s a symbol not only of LBGTQ people, but also our city’s own history, and the way our community came together in the wake of that tragedy.” Like Kaufman in Orlando, Guillermo-Smith said the warnings to remove painted crosswalks are based on politics.

Article: To back this up, Woodring pointed to potentially stronger-than-expected iPhone builds in China and the possibility for estimates to be revised higher, which will allow the stock's multiple to expand and drive shares up. Morgan Stanley's China team recently raised its iPhone builds estimate for September by 8%, saying iPhone sales were stronger than expected in the June quarter, which means supply will need to be replenished. "These positive revisions are a result of better than expected iPhone sell-through in the June quarter, which reduced iPhone channel inventory below normalized levels, and thus created a larger channel fill opportunity in the September quarter, as the positive build revision is entirely iPhone 16 (2M units) and Pro Max (2M units) models," he said. Woodring said this more upbeat forecast is baked into its estimates already, but it could imply more upside ahead in the December quarter, which is typically more volatile than the September period. "Relative to our current 78M December quarter iPhone shipment forecast, this could imply modest iPhone shipment upside, though we'll be able to narrow this range next month when the iPhone 17 is officially launched," he said. "We are turning more bullish – forward iPhone unit/revenue growth expectations are still relatively muted, many of the same factors that got us bullish last July remain (elongated replacement cycles/pent up iPhone demand, new form factors in the pipeline, structural gross margin tailwinds, etc.), we're past peak tariff risk (Section 232 is a non-event), regulation is not as significant of a near-term headwind as feared (though remains a long-term risk), pricing is an underappreciated lever that Apple can pull for both Product and Services (Apple hasn't raise Services prices in 2 years), and relative to the S & P, Apple is trading in-line with the trailing 5 year average," the analyst said.

Article: Erin strengthens into the Atlantic season's first hurricane Tropical Storm Erin is forecast to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by Thursday and could become a major hurricane by Sunday. Erin strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph on Friday morning more than 400 miles east of the northeastern Caribbean's Leeward Islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane could bring some gusty winds, rain, rough surf and rip currents to parts of the far northeastern Caribbean as it slides just north of the islands this weekend. They aren't quite as warm as the record levels reached in 2023 and 2024, but are still far warmer than they'd be in a world that wasn't heating up due to fossil fuel pollution. Erin could explode in strength once it reaches this very warm water and become the season's first major hurricane - Category 3 or higher - by Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Bermuda High - a large, semi-permanent area of clockwise circulating high pressure that meanders over the Atlantic Ocean - is often in the driver's seat in this case: When the high turns the steering wheel, the hurricane generally follows. But if Erin develops more slowly, the system could stay lower in the atmosphere, where the trade winds - winds that flow clockwise around the equator - could keep it tracking to the west and prevent it from turning. An area of showers and thunderstorms in the southern portion of the Gulf has a medium chance of becoming a tropical depression before the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. The stormy area has a short window to develop while drifting over the very warm water of the Gulf before it moves inland, likely in northeastern Mexico or southern Texas, by Friday night. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain is in place Friday in far southern Texas with a Level 1 of 4 risk for the rest of the state's Gulf Coast, as well as parts of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, due to the anticipated arrival of moisture-loaded air, according to the Weather Prediction Center.

Article: The defendant’s name is Sean Charles Dunn, but you might know him as “sandwich guy.” According to the criminal complaint filed against him, Dunn — a military veteran and Justice Department lawyer — had a confrontation earlier this week with a Customs and Border Protection agent. (According to his lawyer, the government sent 20 police officers to his home on Wednesday night to take him into custody.) Time will tell what, if anything, comes of this case, but take a moment to consider how some of the relevant players have talked about the alleged crime: “Assault a law enforcement officer, and you’ll be prosecuted,” Pirro said. “The Trump Administration will always stand up for law enforcement officers and hold those accountable who seek to do them harm,” the White House said, conveniently overlooking the time Trump decided not to hold felons accountable for attacking law enforcement officers. But Bondi’s rhetoric — “You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement” — was especially amazing because just last week the public saw video evidence of a former FBI agent named Jared Wise encouraging his fellow rioters to “kill” police officers on Jan. Months after he received a Trump pardon, Wise was hired to work in Bondi’s Justice Department — which, when asked about Wise’s record of endorsing deadly violence against cops, referred to him as “a valued member” of the DOJ.

Article: GENEVA (AP) — Talks on a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement Friday as the session was adjourned with plans to resume at a later date. Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said despite challenges, despite the disappointment, “we have to accept that significant progress was made.” READ MORE:One of the biggest microplastic pollution sources isn’t straws or grocery bags – it’s your tires This process won’t stop, she said, but it’s too soon to say how long it will take to get a treaty now. Madagascar said the world is “expecting action, not reports from us.” European Commissioner Jessika Roswall said the European Union and its member states had higher expectations for this meeting and while the draft falls short on their demands, it’s a good basis for another negotiating session. Lots of red lines The biggest issue of the talks has been whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse. New language had been added to say these levels exceed current waste management capacities and are projected to increase further, “thereby necessitating a coordinated global response to halt and reverse such trends.” The objective of the treaty was revamped to state that the accord would be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics. The International Pollutants Elimination Network said what happened in Geneva showed “consensus is dead.” Thursday was the last scheduled day of negotiations, but work on the revised draft continued into Friday. Science shows what it will take to end pollution and protect human health, said Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicology professor at Sweden’s University of Gothenburg who co-leads the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty. Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, said the best option now is to move forward with more negotiations to “fight for a treaty that truly safeguards people and the planet.”

Article: President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit also deals a heavy blow to the West's policy of "nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine's mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting, a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to. When asked in Anchorage about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia "never plans ahead." "We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over "a working breakfast." They are then expected to hold a joint press conference.

Article: Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket when the 21-year-old leads an understrength T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September. With regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and England's other all-format players rested, the leadership for three T20s in Dublin has been handed to all-rounder Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer. Monty Bowden was 23 years and 144 days old when he led England in a Test against South Africa in 1889, and to date he remains the youngest man to have captained England in an international. Prior to the Ireland tour, a full-strength England will play three one-day internationals and three T20s against South Africa, and Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker has been given a first call-up. He had been targeting a return in the fifth Test against India earlier this month before a setback and his continued absence is a concern given his importance to England's hopes in the Ashes this winter. Brydon Carse, who skipped The Hundred to manage his workload, is included among the attack options for the South Africa matches, along with Jofra Archer, Baker, Jamie Overton and Saqib Mahmood. Despite both holding central contracts, there is still no place for all-rounders Sam Curran or Liam Livingstone – even in the squad for the Ireland series when the likes of Brook, Archer, Carse, Joe Root, Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith are resting.

Article: Donald Trump’s attempt to replace the nonpartisan chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics with a woefully underqualified MAGA extremist has advocates for women in the workplace worried about how the administration could potentially manipulate data to serve its political agenda. As Alana Samuels wrote earlier this month for Time magazine, there’s already evidence that the Trump administration’s policies — particularly its mass deportation agenda and strict return-to-work requirements for federal employees — have contributed to a mass exodus of women from the workplace in the first several months of Trump’s second term. Some women’s advocates fear this trend could worsen — and that a MAGA-fied BLS could cook the books or simply withhold data to hide the true scope of this growing problem. “Eliminating the jobs report while women flee the workforce isn’t incompetence, it’s the intended outcome of their war on civil rights.” On the campaign trail last year, Trump proclaimed himself a “protector” of American women. And threatening to just disband and no longer issue [BLS] reports — it’s just a way to hide data that is harmful to the administration.” Using a feminist lens to analyze problems in the modern-day workplace, Farrell’s organization relies on BLS data to assess issues like claims of pay inequality and whether women are being funneled into certain low-paying jobs. As examples of that trend, Farrell pointed to some MAGA allies’ promotion of the idea that women should lose some rights (such as voting); conservatives’ assault on diversity, equity and inclusion policies; and the apparent metastasis of anti-feminist views in recent years among conservatives — and even among some liberal men. “What we have seen over the past six months is everyone saying the quiet parts out loud: ‘Women do not deserve equity, and they certainly don’t deserve to be in the workplace,’” Farrell said. “We see that not only from sort of the trends we’re seeing with women being pushed out, but a complete abdication of policy progress on child care, paid family leave, pay equity, addressing sexual harassment in the workplace.” She warned that Trump’s threat to the BLS is “extraordinarily dangerous” and could turn workforce data into an “a tool of sexism.” “First they dismantled workplace protections.

Article: But schisms within Bolivia’s long-dominant left have opened the door to a possible right-wing victory, with candidates like businessman Samuel Doria Medina and former President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga leading the race. To avoid a run-off, the top presidential candidate must either earn more than 50 percent of the vote or garner 40 percent of the vote and have a 10-point lead over the second-place contender. “This is the first national election in two decades without a dominant party or a clear frontrunner,” said Glaeldys Gonzalez Calanche, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a research nonprofit. He shared a ticket at the time with the country’s former military dictator Hugo Banzer, whose government in the 1970s was associated with abuses such as torture and enforced disappearances. Outgoing president and MAS member Luis Arce has been blamed for Bolivia’s slumping economy, and MAS founder Evo Morales has been locked in a feud with both Arce and Rodriguez as he seeks to regain the presidency himself. But the two leaders have fallen out, in part as a result of their rivalry for the presidency, and Morales has rallied his supporters to his side in a split that has fractured the Bolivian left. With tensions high, economic conditions deteriorating, and no consensus candidate to lead the country, Gonzalez Calanche fears Bolivia could be heading into a period of uncertainty as it approaches a possible second round of voting.

Article: It couldn’t be higher!” This is certainly the line the GOP is expected to toe, as evidenced by House Speaker Mike Johnson declaring on CNBC last month that Trump’s approval rating is “skyrocketing.” The Louisiana Republican added, “CNN had a story, I think a day or two ago, he was at a 90% approval rating. Thank you.” His missive didn’t include any references to any specific surveys, and for good reason: Trump, who has a habit of making up imaginary approval ratings for himself, was peddling nonsense. The latest national poll from Gallup found Trump’s approval slipping to an embarrassing 37%, and a new national survey from the Pew Research Center pointed in a very similar direction. Trump has said the public “loves” his trade tariffs, but the Pew poll found 61% of Americans disapprove of his tariff policies (which is consistent with several other recent national surveys that generated similar results). Trump has said the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has helped improve his public standing, but the Pew poll found 70% of the public disapproves of the administration’s handling of the matter, and 63% lack trust in what the White House has to say about the controversy. In terms of his personal characteristics, the number of Americans who see Trump as “mentally sharp” has dropped below 50%, and he fares far worse on questions related to his “honesty,” his ability to “keep his promises” and his interest in looking out for “ordinary” people. Issa might believe that Trump’s public support “couldn’t be higher,” but I’d remind the congressman that, as a rule, it’s pretty easy for presidents to have approval ratings higher than 38%. I’m mindful of the argument that his approval rating no longer matters, since he cannot legally seek another term, but I continue to think polls like these are important to the extent that popular presidents wield more power, while flailing presidents wield less.

Article: Donald Trump has long recognized the broad popularity of the Social Security system, so it was hardly a surprise that the president signed a proclamation this week celebrating the social insurance program on its 90th birthday. President Donald Trump marked the 90th anniversary of Social Security on Thursday with an Oval Office signing of a proclamation that the safety net was ‘more resilient than ever before,’ thanks to him. Early on at his Oval Office event, the president boasted, “Last month, I signed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ and allowed no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, OK? So, how’s that?” It was a rhetorical question, but if Trump really wants to know, he did not actually eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, even if he’s convinced himself otherwise — and repeats the falsehood on a regular basis. Just as notably, the president insisted that his administration is “strengthening Social Security for generations to come,” which also wasn’t true — since the Republicans’ domestic policy megabill is expected to hasten the system’s insolvency date. In other words, on the 90th anniversary of the Social Security system, Trump held an official White House event and signed a celebratory proclamation, while pushing four specific claims about his record. To complicate matters, Frank Bisignano, Trump’s Social Security commissioner, sent a mass email to beneficiaries hours after the Oval Office event in which he touted “President Trump’s vision” for the system and the administration’s record of “delivering extraordinary customer service.” Part of the problem with this is the dubious nature of the claims. As we discussed the last time the Social Security commissioner played fast and loose with the facts, Americans need to be able to rely on ostensibly apolitical federal agencies for accurate information, free of partisan taint. But when people get an unsolicited official statement from the Social Security Administration, they should be able to have some confidence that the agency isn’t trying to mislead them with deceptive political messaging. And yet, here we are, watching the SSA join a list of politicized agencies, being used as partisan tools in the White House’s political toolbox, creating a dynamic in which Americans won’t know whether they can trust the next message they receive from the government about Social Security.

Article: Like many Afghans evacuated amid the August 15 Taliban takeover of Kabul, Girowal, who worked in human rights under the former Afghan government, still remains stuck in “legal limbo” in the United States. She often recalls the mad dash amid a crush of bodies at the crowded Kabul International Airport: people shot in front of her, a week of hiding, a flight to Qatar, then Germany and then finally, the US state of Virginia. “I am very much fearful that I can be subjected to deportation at any time.” Unheeded warnings Four years after the US withdrawal, much remains unclear about how Trump’s policies will affect Afghans who are already in the US, estimated to total about 180,000. They arrived through a tangle of different avenues, including 75,000 flown in on evacuation flights in the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal, as the administration of US President Joe Biden undertook what it dubbed “Operation Allies Welcome“. Others have been resettled through a special State Department programme, known as Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2), launched by the administration of President Biden, meant for Afghans who face persecution for having worked in various capacities on behalf of the US government or with a US-based organisation in Afghanistan. Adam Bates, a supervisory policy counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Programme, explained that some of those pathways, most notably the SIV and refugee programmes, provide a clear course towards US residency and, eventually, citizenship. “That was with one eye towards the potential of giving the Trump administration this opportunity to really double down and target this community.” Pressure on Afghans in the US During Trump’s new term, his administration has taken several concrete – and at times contradictory – moves that affect Afghans living in the US. It ended “temporary protected status” (TPS) for Afghans already in the country at the time of the Taliban takeover, arguing the country shows “an improved security situation” and “stabilising economy”, a claim contradicted by several human rights reports. At the same time, the Trump administration added Afghanistan to a new travel ban list, restricting visas for Afghans, saying such admissions broadly run counter to US “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism”. Trump has offered his contradictory messaging, criticising the Biden administration on the campaign trail for its handling of the withdrawal, and as recently as July, pledging to “save” evacuated Afghans subject to deportation from the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, the administration terminated a special status for those who entered the US via the CBP One app in April, potentially affecting thousands of Afghans who entered via the southern border. After being evacuated in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans were granted humanitarian parole, a temporary status that allowed them to legally live and work in the US for two years, with an extension granted in 2023. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not publicly released how many evacuated Afghans remain in the US on humanitarian parole, and did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for the data. “It feels as if we have pulled the rug out from many of our Afghan allies through these policy changes that strip legal protection for many Afghans in the US and limit pathways for Afghans who are still abroad to come to the US safely,” Kristyn Peck, the chief executive officer of the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, told Al Jazeera. She noted that the SIV pipeline has continued to operate under Trump, although there have been some limitations, including requiring those approved for relocation to pay for their own travel. Susan Antolin, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, a non-profit organisation that offers mental health, legal and social support to Afghans in the US, said organisations like hers are also bracing for sustained uncertainty. “We are diversifying our funding and trying very hard, as so many other organisations are, to find other avenues to bring in that funding to continue to support our programmes,” she told Al Jazeera. We have to do 10 times more, or 100 times more, of the work.” ‘No more a priority for the world’ The unstable situation in the US reflects a broader global trend. Still, it has upgraded diplomatic ties with several governments in recent years, and in July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. At the same time, the governments of Pakistan and Iran have accelerated expulsions of Afghans back to Afghanistan, with more than 1.4 million Afghans either being expelled or leaving Iran alone from January to July of 2025, according to UNHCR. Germany, too, has begun deporting Afghans back to Afghanistan, in July, it conducted its second deportation flight since the Taliban came to power, despite continuing not to recognise or maintain diplomatic ties with the group. The collective moves send a clear message, evacuee Girowal said: “We know that Afghanistan is no more a priority for the world.” Still, she said she has not abandoned hope that the US under Trump’s leadership will “not forget its allies”.

Article: ANCHORAGE, Alaska — President Donald Trump will host his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for a meeting here Friday in an audacious bid to broker a peace deal and stop a three-year war with Ukraine and its ever-rising body count. Trump spent the run-up to the summit tempering expectations that it would produce a breakthrough, casting it instead as a prelude to an as-yet-unscheduled meeting that would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Follow along for live updates “The president is realistic that this is likely a multistep process and he’s ready and positive about this step forward,” a senior Trump administration official told NBC News on Friday morning, when asked about the president’s mindset. military base stands as one of the few hopeful moments in a grinding conflict that started in February 2022 when Russia sent tanks rolling across the border into Ukraine with the goal of swallowing up its democratic neighbor. After boarding Air Force One on Friday morning for his flight to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Trump said of his face-to-face visit with Putin: “Something’s going to come of it.” Russia’s early attempt to march into Kyiv, the Ukraine capital, sputtered and the conflict has since devolved into a war of attrition, with casualties totaling about 1.5 million. For one, the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin stemming from his conduct in the war, meaning he could have been apprehended if the site had been in a host of other nations. is not a signatory to the court.) What’s more, Alaska used to belong to Putin’s country, a fact that Russian commentators and political elite have seized on as a positive signal for the talks. purchased the territory in 1867 for $7.2 million, an acquisition that, ironically, strengthened America’s military position on the Pacific rim in a rivalry with Russia that has waxed and waned for decades. Putin wants all of Russia’s territory back and yet he’s coming to a place that was a former Russian colony to meet with the president of the United States — when he has no chance of getting Alaska back.” A subplot of the meeting is the personal chemistry between the American and Russian presidents. Upon his return to the White House in January, Trump at one point suggested he had a certain kinship with Putin over investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race. "My worry is that, well, the photo-op in and of itself essentially legitimizes war crimes, telegraphs to other autocrats or evil men around the world that they can get away with murdering civilians and still get a photo-op with the president of the United States," he said. In his remarks Friday on Air Force One, he said that he would discuss divisions of territory in his meeting with Putin, though he added, “I’ve got to let Ukraine make that decision.” In a post on X Friday morning, Zelenskyy wrote in English: “The key thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format — Ukraine, the United States, and the Russian side. We are ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.” As it now stands, Trump is set to hold a news conference after his meeting and working lunch with Putin, and then fly home Friday night.

Article: Appeals court rules that layoffs affecting most CFPB staff can proceed toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images/AFP A three-judge federal appeals court panel has ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's attempt to lay off the vast majority of its employees can proceed. The case concerns the reduction in force that the Trump administration conducted at the bureau in mid-April, in which layoff notices were sent to more than 1,400 staffers, leaving only about 200 employees remaining. Sponsor Message "We hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims predicated on loss of employment, which must proceed through the specialized-review scheme established in the Civil Service Reform Act," Judge Gregory Katsas wrote for the majority. Congress created the CFPB in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as part of the bipartisan Dodd-Frank Act, and the bureau has dozens of responsibilities it is legally obligated to perform to protect consumers. But the DC circuit appellate court ruled on April 11 that CFPB officials could conduct a reduction in force if they made "a particularized assessment" to determine which employees were "unnecessary" for the bureau's performance of its statutory duties. "An approximately 200 person agency allows the Bureau to fulfill its statutory duties and better aligns with the new leadership's priorities and management philosophy," CFPB chief legal counsel Mark Paoletta wrote in April . Paoletta wrote in a memo sent to staff on April 16 that in order to "focus on tangible harms to consumers, the Bureau will shift resources away from enforcement and supervision that can be done by the States," and would focus more on banks and mortgage fraud, while deprioritizing areas including medical debt, student loans, peer-to-peer lending and digital payments. "There is reason to believe that the defendants simply spent the days immediately following the Circuit's relaxation of the Order dressing their RIF [reduction in force] in new clothes, and that they are thumbing their nose at both this Court and the Court of Appeals," Jackson wrote , and blocked the layoffs by ordering an injunction. Sponsor Message With the passage in early July of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the CFPB's budget was cut nearly in half , though it retains the ability to request funds from Congress. The Supreme Court recently ruled that the Trump administration may continue its mass firings of federal workers, but that decision does not directly affect this case, according to the NTEU 335, the union representing CFPB employees.

"Most critically, the order threatens to upend the command structure of MPD and wreak operational havoc within the department, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike." Local officials were clearly struggling to avoid this kind of clash. Bondi's order stated that "Commissioner Cole shall assume all of the powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police." toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU for NPR Despite violent crime in the city reaching a 30-year low, Trump argued this week that the city is at-risk of becoming a "wasteland." "Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people," Trump said. The federal lawsuit filed Friday by Schwalb claims that Trump's sweeping claim of federal power over local police is a clear violation of DC's Home Rule charter, established by Congress. This legal fight over operational control comes after Trump said on Monday that local police under federal control would act much more aggressively and would have permission from administration officials to do "whatever the hell they want."

Link: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/critics-say-trumps-push-for-fairness-in-college-admissions-is-leaving-out-legacy-preferences
Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump attempts to reshape college admissions, he’s promising a new era of fairness, with an emphasis on merit and test scores and a blind eye toward diversity. Trump often rails against systems he describes as “rigged,” but he has overlooked a glaring instance in higher education, said Richard Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Progressive Policy Institute think tank who has written about admissions. READ MORE: College endowment tax is leading to hiring freezes and could mean cuts in financial aid READ MORE: Early education experts see this new Trump rule as ‘the wrong step at the wrong time’ “It’s hard to think of a more flagrant way in which the system is rigged than legacy preferences,” Kahlenberg said. “Rarely is a system of hereditary privilege so openly practiced without any sense of shame.” In recent weeks, Trump has taken several actions to scrub any vestiges of race from admissions decisions, suggesting that some schools are ignoring a 2023 Supreme Court decision striking down affirmative action. Many selective colleges consider family ties Sometimes called “affirmative action for the rich,” the practice of legacy admissions remains widespread among elite colleges even as it faces mounting bipartisan opposition. A push for merit, but no mention of legacy admissions The executive action signed by Trump last week requires universities to turn over more information about students who apply to and are accepted to their campuses. Trump’s silence caught the attention of the nonprofit Lawyers for Civil Rights, which has an open complaint with the Education Department alleging that Harvard University’s use of donor and alumni preferences amounts to illegal racial discrimination. Then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, urged colleges to rethink legacy preferences in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, saying it expanded “privilege instead of opportunity.” Some feared it would drive up white enrollment as affirmative action ended. Among the 20 most selective universities that say they employ the practice, none would tell The Associated Press what percentage of their incoming class has a family connection to alumni or donors. New scrutiny is needed to ensure colleges are following the Supreme Court’s order and “recruiting and training capable future doctors, engineers, scientists” and other workers, he said in his executive action.

The combat exercises are “an opportunity for us to practice how we collaborate and respond to shared security challenges and project force over great distances in the Indo-Pacific,” Jones said. On Monday, a Chinese navy ship collided with a Chinese coast guard ship while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard vessel in the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern over “the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard” and said the incident “highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” In response, the U.S. deployed two warships off the Scarborough on Wednesday in what it called a freedom of navigation operation to protest China’s expansive claims, restrictions and its demand for entry notifications in the disputed waters. In February, a Chinese J-16 fighter jet released flares that passed within 30 meters (100 feet) of an Australian P-8 Poseidon military surveillance plane in daylight and in international air space, Australian defense officials said at the time.

The chipmaker jumped after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is in talks to buy a stake in Intel , which would help fund factories Intel is building in Ohio. The bank cited lukewarm quarterly results from Cisco earlier this week, saying that "though the company reported more than $2bn of AI infrastructure orders in FY25, strength seems to be getting offset by weakness elsewhere." Sandisk — The data storage provider lost nearly 11% after Sandisk said fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin dropped to 26.4% from 36.4% a year ago. Twilio — The cloud-based communications software developer will join the S & P MidCap 400 index before the start of trading on Tuesday August 19, S & P Dow Jones Indices said , following the removal of Amedisys after its acquisition by UnitedHealth Group.

Article: Opendoor shares popped about 10% on Friday after CEO Carrie Wheeler said she's resigning from the online real estate company, which has seen a surge in recent interest from retail investors. Pressure began building on Wheeler, who took over the top job in 2022, after the company's quarterly earnings report earlier this month failed to reassure investors that a turnaround is underway. "The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead," Wheeler wrote in a post on X. "I believe the best thing I can do for Opendoor now is to accelerate my succession plans that I shared with the Board mid-year and make room for new leadership to take the reins." Opendoor's business involves using technology to buy and sell homes, pocketing the gains. In its latest earnings report, Opendoor said it expects to acquire just 1,200 homes in the third quarter, down from 1,757 in the second quarter and 3,504 in the third quarter of 2024.

"And there is unfortunately less that the US government can do directly to help with this." The chipmaker could of course use the government's money as it burns cash and suffers heavy losses from building out its manufacturing capacity, Rasgon said. But it is unclear how the economics of the Ohio plant will work if Trump forces its completion before a customer base is in place to support the capacity, he said.

Article: The Taliban’s leader has warned that Afghans ungrateful for its hardline rule will be severely punished by God in a statement marking the fourth anniversary of the group’s return to power. The statement from Haibatullah Akhunzada was made in a social media post on Friday to commemorate “Victory Day”, four years on from the chaotic United States and NATO withdrawal from the country after more than 20 years of war as the Taliban retook the capital, Kabul. The threat was a stark reminder of the sweeping restrictions and repression of rights, especially of women and girls, that has taken place under the Taliban’s rule, which is based on its strict interpretation of Islamic law. In his statement, Akhunzada said Afghans had faced hardships for decades in the name of establishing religious law in the country, which he said had saved citizens from “corruption, oppression, usurpation, drugs, theft, robbery and plunder”. “These are great divine blessings that our people should not forget and, during the commemoration of Victory Day, express great gratitude to Allah Almighty so that the blessings will increase,” his statement said. “If, against God’s will, we fail to express gratitude for blessings and are ungrateful for them, we will be subjected to the severe punishment of Allah Almighty.” He also advised government ministers to remove the word “acting” from their job titles, signalling the consolidation of his administration’s rule in the country amid a lack of internal opposition. Victory Day Four years on from its return to power, the Taliban government remains largely isolated in the international arena over the severe rights restrictions imposed under its rule although Russia became the first country to officially recognise the Taliban administration in early July. ‘An open wound of history’ Rather than celebrating, members of the activist group United Afghan Women’s Movement for Freedom staged an indoor protest in the northeastern province of Takhar against the Taliban’s oppressive rule, The Associated Press news agency reported. Repression and death threats The United Nations, foreign governments and human rights groups have condemned the Taliban for their treatment of women and girls, who are banned from most education and work, as well as parks, gyms and travelling without a male guardian. Inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry require women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head, while a law announced a year ago ordered women not to sing or recite poetry in public and for their voices and bodies to be “concealed” outside the home. Advertisement The report said the Taliban had told the UN mission that its cadres were not responsible for the threats and a Ministry of Interior Affairs investigation is under way.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article A Missouri resident has been hospitalized with what health officials described as a deadly "brain-eating infection" after possibly waterskiing in a local lake. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said in a Wednesday news release that the patient — who they have not identified — appears to have been exposed to a Naegleria fowleri. The agency described Naegleria fowleri as "a microscopic single-celled free-living ameba that can cause a rare, deadly infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), also known as 'brain-eating' infection." Health officials said that a preliminary investigation suggests that the patient may have been water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks, a reservoir in central Missouri, days before becoming ill. Naegleria fowleri is commonly found in freshwater, according to the agency, but PAM is "extremely rare." The ameba is typically ingested through the nose and travels up to the brain, where it damages the brain tissue, the agency added. Last month, 12-year-old Jaysen Carr died from contracting PAM days after swimming in Lake Murray in South Carolina, according to a statement the law firm representing Carr's family posted on Facebook. The CDC says that most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin, and that the infection typically leads to coma and death within five days.

Michigan was fined $50,000 plus 10% of the budget of the football program, as well as fined the equivalent of its revenue share from the next two college football postseasons — a figure that could approach $20 million, reports ESPN. The NCAA said in a report it uncovered 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting for 13 Wolverines opponents, though the report adds “the true scope and scale of the scheme — including the competitive advantage it conferred — will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction and withholding of materials and information.” Michigan won a national championship after the 2023 season, during which the investigation into Stalions was first announced. Individuals disciplined as a result of the infractions include former head coach Jim Harbaugh, who currently coaches the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, Stalions, former director of player personnel Denard Robinson, and current head coach Sherrone Moore.

Article: Several Republican senators shot down the tariff rebate check plan publicly, calling the proposal everything from "a bad idea" to "insane." Most conservatives instead want to use any tariff revenue to pay down the national debt. Hawley introduced legislation to provide tariff rebate checks of at least $600 per adult and child, similar to the stimulus checks the government provided during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has teased sending other rebate checks In February, Trump said that he liked the idea of giving some of the savings from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency back to U.S. He said at an investment conference in Miami that the administration was considering a concept in which 20% of the savings produced by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts goes to American citizens and another 20% goes to paying down the national debt.

Article: California Democrats will counter Texas Republicans ended a legislative session Friday without approving new congressional maps, but they still intend to satisfy President Donald Trump's wishes for redistricting that bolsters their party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as a multistate fight over control of Congress intensifies. The nation's two most populous states have been at the forefront of a partisan battle that has reached into multiple courtrooms and statehouses controlled by both parties, with the balance of Capitol Hill and Trump's agenda at stake for the latter half of his second presidency. "Do not go very far, as I believe our governor will be calling us back for another special session very soon," Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said during a brief session Friday morning before lawmakers adjourned. "We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country," Newsom said at what amounted to a campaign kickoff rally for the as-yet unreleased maps. We can shape the future." Newsom's announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas has officially waded into the mid-decade redistricting fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves. In Missouri, a document obtained by The Associated Press shows the state Senate received a $46,000 invoice to activate six redistricting software licenses and provide training for up to 10 staff members.

"Gavin Newsom's latest stunt has nothing to do with Californians and everything to do with consolidating radical Democrat power, silencing California voters, and propping up his pathetic 2028 presidential pipe dream," National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Christian Martinez said in a statement. "Newsom's made it clear: he'll shred California's Constitution and trample over democracy - running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority." California Democrats hold 43 of the state's 52 House seats.

Article: President Donald Trump’s face-to-face high-stakes summit with President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday could determine the fate of European security as well as the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Alaska to provide Trump with military advice General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. forces in Europe, is in Alaska to provide military advice to President Trump and Secretary Hegseth as President Trump tries to bring this war to a peaceful close,” the official said. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons. Grynkewich’s presence in Alaska is likely to be welcomed by European leaders who have spent recent days trying to convince President Trump to be robust with President Putin and not to do a deal over Kyiv’s head. Hillary Clinton has a message for Trump “If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin’s war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I’ll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself,” the former U.S. He is meeting with an adversary.” WATCH: How Baltic nations are working to fortify their border with Russia But Clinton said that if Trump can negotiate a ceasefire, have Russia withdraw from the territory it seized and bring an end to the war without making Ukraine concede territory, she would join the Nobel lobbying. local time Friday in Anchorage, where he will be met at the plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV, an excerpt of which was published on reporter Pavel Zarubin’s Telegram channel on Friday. Trump speaks to Putin ally as he heads to Alaska The president posted on his social media network that he had “a wonderful talk” with the president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko. I think it hurts him, but I’ll be talking to him about it later.” Trump also talked on Air Force One about economic benefits for Russia, while warning of more severe sanctions if the talks aren’t fruitful. security guarantees for Ukraine, ‘but not in the form of NATO’ Trump says there’s “a possibility” of the United States offering Ukraine security guarantees alongside European powers, “but not in the form of NATO.” Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the summit with Putin in Alaska. He said it will be up to the Ukrainians to decide whether to concede land to Putin as part of a peace deal, but added: “I think they’ll make the proper decision.” “I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine,” Trump said. “I’m here to get them at a table.” Macron and Zelenskyy huddled ahead of the Alaska summit The office of President Emmanuel Macron says the French leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke Thursday and again Friday before the Trump-Putin summit. The two have agreed to meet each other after the U.S.-Russia summit, when “it will be most useful and effective.” The brief readout of the exchanges didn’t detail any specifics of what Macron and Zelenskyy discussed. Several Cabinet members will accompany Trump on Air Force One Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are among the Trump administration officials joining the president for his flight to Alaska.

Article: A local Mexican restaurant chain in Pennsylvania is trying to forge ahead a week after a worksite immigration raid left property damage at two of its storefronts and a workforce afraid to show up to their jobs, according to two employees and a witness who spoke with NBC News. As many as 16 workers were detained — nine worked at a location in Gibsonia, a suburb north of Pittsburgh, and seven others worked at another location in the nearby township of Cranberry. “No one wants to go back, everyone is scared.” Both workers who spoke with NBC News requested to not be named to protect their family’s privacy because of an ongoing federal investigation in connection with last week’s events. As the immigration arrests were happening last week, someone alerted an emergency response immigration hotline run by Casa San Jose, a local nonprofit that advocates for Latino and immigrant communities. The organization quickly dispatched about 20 volunteers to both locations to act as legal observers, collect testimonies and provide support to the workers and families affected, according to Jaime Martinez, a community defense organizer at Casa San Jose. At the Gibsonia location, “the raid actually caused a kitchen fire that agents were unable to extinguish at the beginning, which put people in danger,” Martinez told NBC News on Tuesday. Employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers said the stove was on when agents entered the kitchen because workers were cooking food as they prepared to open the restaurant Thursday morning. The detained employees, who had their arms and ankles shackled, were the ones who directed the agents to find the fire extinguisher and instructed them on how to use it after initially failing to operate it, according to employees who spoke to Martinez and his volunteers. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told NBC News in an email Thursday that the “damage to the restaurant, including the small fire, was created by the illegal aliens themselves while they were trying to escape or hide from law enforcement officers.” According to ICE, the agents showed up at the locations in Gibsonia and Cranberry to execute federal search warrants based on information it got alleging that the restaurants were employing undocumented workers, WPXI, NBC’s affiliate in Pittsburgh, reported. In response to this, the ICE spokesperson told NBC News, “All agents and officers followed established legal procedures while executing the warrants.” At the Cranberry location, Casa San Jose volunteers interviewed a worker who described seeing officers come into the restaurant, shouting “police” and pointing their long guns at the employees. While she was not detained after showing proper documentation, “this lady is now going to have to live with the trauma of having law enforcement point a gun at her head while she was at work,” Martinez said. Martinez and one of the workers who spoke with NBC News said agents lined up all of the cuffed employees and made them kneel while pointing their weapons at them. “Agents and officers operated within established law enforcement standards in order to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers, the public and the illegal aliens themselves,” the ICE spokesperson said in response to this allegation. “There were nine people in that restaurant on lockdown,” Martinez said, adding his group doesn’t know the immigration status of those workers since it doesn’t ask people about that as part of its policy. “But you don’t have to be undocumented to be afraid of getting detained.” Since launching the hotline in March, Casa San Jose has received more than 650 calls reporting more than 100 immigration detentions in the area and has dispatched volunteers in at least 70 instances, according to Martinez. The workers who spoke with NBC News said the business plans to use the funds to cover bond expenses, one month worth of salary for each employee detained and repair damage done to the restaurant.

Article: The Geysers-Clear Lake area is one of California’s eight volcanic areas, and the Geysers team field — on the southwest area of the volcanic field — is home to one of the world’s most productive geothermal power facilities, according to the U.S. Advertisement One possible reason for that, the USGS says, is that taking away steam and heat from the steam field can “cause the surrounding rock to contract, which in turn can induce earthquakes as a result of the contractional stresses.” Also, reclaimed cold water from Santa Rosa and Lake County is pumped to the Geysers, and the interaction with hot rock appears to be “a significant factor in inducing the earthquakes,” the agency says. In order for a larger earthquake to occur, it is necessary that a large fault exist,” the USGS says, and “at the Geysers, no such continuous fault is known to exist.”

Relief funding for Hill Country floods - Legislation to provide relief funding for response to and recovery from the storms which began in early July 2025, including local match funding for jurisdictions eligible for FEMA public assistance. Eliminate STAAR test - Legislation to eliminate the STAAR test and replace it with effective tools to assess student progress and ensure school district accountability Cut property taxes - Legislation reducing the property tax burden on Texans and legislation imposing spending limits on entities authorized to impose property taxes.

Article: -- The NCAA fined Michigan tens of millions of dollars Friday and suspended coach Sherrone Moore for three games for a sign-stealing scandal that has loomed over college football's winningest program for nearly two years. Financial penalties are expected to exceed $20 million and include a $50,000 fine, a 10% fine on the football program's budget, a 10% fine on Michigan's 2025-26 scholarships and a fine equivalent to the anticipated loss of postseason revenue for the 2025 and 2026 seasons. The NCAA does not have rules against stealing signs, but does prohibit schools from sending scouts to the games of future opponents and using electronic equipment to record another team's signals. Harbaugh, who left the Wolverines after they won the 2023 national championship and now coaches the Los Angeles Chargers, served a three-game suspension in exchange for the Big Ten dropping its investigation into the allegations after the two ended up in court. Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti sent a letter to the NCAA Committee on Infractions last month, suggesting that Michigan's football program should not face more sanctions related to the sign-stealing saga.

Our museums have an obligation to represent what happened in our country over the years, good and bad, but what happened over the years in an accurate way.” Obviously, few would take issue with the idea of museums being “fair” and “accurate,” but the devil’s in the details: We’re not talking about objective fact-checking conducted by experienced historians and other scholars; we’re talking about Trump appointees looking for “woke” Smithsonian exhibitions — based on standards that don't appear to exist. Indeed, this week’s letter to the Smithsonian was signed by three people, including White House senior associate Lindsey Halligan, a 35-year-old lawyer with no professional or academic background in history or museum studies. That overemphasis, she added, “just makes us grow further and further apart.” There have been reports this week on a growing number of Smithsonian employees who are “scared” of the White House’s offensive.

(Disclaimers: I did not include his nonfiction or his non-legal novels, nor did I get my hands on the unsuccessful TV pilot for The Street Lawyer, starring Eddie Cibrian, or the 1995 TV adaptation of The Client, starring JoBeth Williams. (Contrary to the way it often seems, everything is not available to stream somewhere.) I also stuck to the novel adaptations, so I omitted The Gingerbread Man, an adaptation of a story Grisham had written but never published as a novel.) YouTube 9. The Firm (TV) (2012, NBC) Plot: In 2012, NBC made 22 episodes of the sequel series The Firm as a standard network legal drama, where there was always a case of the week plus some ongoing intrigue about Mitch McDeere (Josh Lucas) and the shady firm he worked for — a different shady firm than the one he had escaped years before. (Disclaimer: I have watched the first bunch of episodes and the last one and researched what happened in the interim, which is a lot more of this show than most people experienced.) Sponsor Message Notable supporting cast: Assistant Tammy (played by Holly Hunter in the movie) is played by Juliette Lewis. Bad guys: Big law firms, sometimes his own clients, Tricia Helfer from Battlestar Galactica The bottom line: Aside from the suspension of disbelief required to believe that Mitch would stumble his way into another law firm infested with murderers, the attempt to translate Grisham to this format, where the actual story was constantly interrupted by dull little cases for Mitch to fiddle with, did not work at all. Highlight: The sheer audacity to start the season with an unexplained flash-forward of Mitch running with a briefcase while wearing a suit and then end the season with an unexplained flash-forward of Mitch running with a briefcase while wearing a suit in a completely different situation Lowlight: The endlessly meandering references to "the truth" that nobody will just spit out already Grisham score: 1 YouTube 8. The Chamber (1996, directed by James Foley) Plot: Attorney Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell) travels to Mississippi to try to prevent the execution of his grandfather (Gene Hackman), who's long been on death row for bombing the office of a Jewish civil rights lawyer in 1967. Bad guys: The death penalty, racists in general and the Ku Klux Klan in particular The bottom line: The Chamber is the most somber of the Grisham adaptations, and while there is some legal maneuvering and some mystery-solving, much of it is a character piece about a young man trying to figure out how to live alongside his family's dark legacy. He gets fired and soon finds himself working for a scrappy small firm run by Bruiser (Lana Parrilla), representing a woman whose son supposedly died of an overdose but who is sure there was foul play. Bad guys: Not entirely clear yet, but certainly big law firms and insurance companies The bottom line: This series isn't bad, exactly, but the plot is completely different from the book and movie. Where the tone of the original story is of a scrappy underdog against a big law firm, the series becomes more of a clash between Rudy and his girlfriend about the ethics of their different choices. Highlight: John Slattery being an only slightly more wicked version of Roger Sterling from Mad Men Lowlight: Turning Bruiser into a woman who very quickly ends up in a sex scene in lingerie for no particularly compelling reason Grisham score: 3 YouTube 6. Runaway Jury (2003, directed by Gary Fleder) Plot: Nick Easter (John Cusack) maneuvers his way onto the jury for a big civil case against a gun manufacturer and starts scheming to sell the verdict to the highest bidder. Notable supporting cast: Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman as the opposing lawyers, Rachel Weisz as Easter's girlfriend and co-conspirator, Nora Dunn as a fellow juror with a flask on her at all times. The movie never quite figures out how Cusack and Weisz are so sure that things are going to turn out the way they plan, and it makes their machinations seem a little less clever. The Client (1994, directed by Joel Schumacher) Plot: Lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon) agrees to represent 11-year-old Mark Sway (Brad Renfro), who has information about a mob murder and is being pressured by an ambitious prosecutor (Tommy Lee Jones) to cooperate, risking his own safety. Notable supporting cast: Mary-Louise Parker as Mark's mother, Bradley Whitford as one of the prosecutor's lackeys, Anthony Edwards as Reggie's assistant, Anthony LaPaglia as an incompetent wannabe mobster Bad guys: Mafia, grandstanding prosecutor Bottom line: It makes sense that Grisham would do a book where the underdog is a kid; nobody is more vulnerable and nobody needs more help to navigate the system. Notable supporting cast: Kiefer Sutherland as a creep who's trying to reinvigorate the local Klan, Oliver Platt as Jake's cynical buddy, Ashley Judd as Jake's wife, Kevin Spacey as the district attorney Bad guys: Racists in general and the Ku Klux Klan in particular, an unethical showoff prosecutor Bottom line: Despite its clunky racial politics, the adaptation of Grisham's first novel makes it easy to understand how Matthew McConaughey instantly became a leading man. Still, much of the most effective drama comes from Jackson, including in a terrific scene where he visits the deputy, played by Chris Cooper, who lost a leg in the shooting — an outcome Carl Lee did not intend, but takes responsibility for.

Article: At a White House late last week, a reporter reminded Donald Trump, “The Norwegian Nobel Committee will make their announcement as it relates to this year’s Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 10.” The reporter then asked the president, “Is that date circled on your calendar?” As part of the Republican’s answer, he replied, “I’m not politicking for it.” No, of course not. It’s not as if the White House, just a few days after the president said he wasn’t lobbying for the honor, released a list of foreign officials who’ve nominated him for the award alongside a picture of Trump and the medal. White House officials and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have called on the Nobel committee to reward Trump; foreign leaders eager to curry favor with the American president have nominated him for the honor; he’s repeatedly complained about not having already received the award and Trump has publicly listed reasons that he believes “they should give me the Nobel Prize.” NBC News reported this week, “Any whiff of indifference is now gone. Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award.” But don’t worry: The president has already assured the public that he’s “not politicking for it.” The question isn’t whether the comment was foolish, since it obviously was. President Donald Trump called Norway’s Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg out of the blue last month to discuss trade tariffs — as well as his bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize. For his part, Stoltenberg confirmed on the record that Trump did call him, but said in a statement that he would not “go into further detail about the content of the conversation.” The official announcement is 56 days away.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation’s capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington’s “emergency police commissioner” with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government’s law-enforcement takeover. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” Schwalb wrote in a memo to Smith, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Bondi’s directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies.” Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. Another expansion of federal authority The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. Smith’s earlier directive effectively brought together Trump’s moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi’s announcement. Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said. A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said. “They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation’s capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.” Wilson said the troops won’t be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren’t making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.” Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he’s using a “very small force” of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown. For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies.

It was unclear when the video was taken, but it shows National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, known for staging provocative encounters with Palestinians, telling Barghouti that he will “not win.” “Anyone who messes with the people of Israel, anyone who murders our children, anyone who murders our women, we will wipe them out,” Ben-Gvir said in the video. “Perhaps a part of me does not want to acknowledge everything that your face and body shows, and what you and the prisoners have been through,” wrote Fadwa Al Barghouthi, who spells their last name differently in English.

Article: Looking at their charts below for buy levels from a technical standpoint, we tend to start our analysis by looking at the 50-day and 200-day moving average – represented by the green and maroon lines, respectively. Meta buy levels: $738, $722, $638 Starting with Meta Platforms, the first level of interest would be around $738 per share, a level that proved to be resistance twice over the past year before the stock broke above it on the back of a strong earnings report. A move to $738 would represent a pullback of roughly 6% from current levels around $788 and put shares at just under a price-to-earnings valuation of 25 times 2026 earnings estimates. Microsoft buy levels: $502, $455, $438 Jumping to Microsoft, the 50-day is currently at around $502, about 4% below current levels around $524 and just over 6% off the stock's all-time closing high. From there, however, we don't see much in terms of support until we get to around $455, a level that previously served as resistance earlier this year before it was breached in late May. A move to this level would put shares at under 30 times fiscal year 2026 earnings estimates, about the midpoint of the P/E range seen over the past five years. Bottom line While the 200-day moving averages are pretty far down for both Microsoft and Meta, those levels are not out of the question if there were a broad-based market pullback.

Article: As California turns to satellite imagery, remote cameras watched by AI and heat detection sensors placed throughout wildlands to detect fires earlier, one Orange County group is keeping it old-school. Whenever the National Weather Service issues a red flag warning, a sign that dangerous fire weather is imminent, Renalynn Funtanilla swiftly sends alerts to her more than 300 volunteers’ phones and inboxes. She wheels TVs into a conference room turned makeshift command center, sets up computers and phones around the table and dispatches volunteers to dozens of trailheads and roadways in Orange County’s wildland-urban interface: likely spots for the county’s next devastating fire to erupt. The volunteers — sporting bright yellow vests and navy blue hats with an “Orange County Fire Watch” emblem — slap large fire watch magnets to the sides of their vehicles, grab some binoculars and start to watch. Advertisement Amid California’s coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems that are plagued with frequent fast-moving fires, preventing ignitions and stamping out fires before they become unmanageable is the name of the game. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) To do it, Orange County Fire Watch is betting on good Samaritans teaching the public how to prevent ignitions and keeping an eye out for potential culprits, from overheating e-bikes to arsonists. (In Orange County, human-operated equipment has historically been responsible for about 34% of wildfires documented by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, while arsonists have started about 15%.) Despite the program’s simplicity, fire experts say this system might be one of our best shots at stifling coastal California’s wildfire problem. “When you have so-called ‘red flag days,’ that is the time to put the effort into monitoring for ignitions,” said Alexandra Syphard, who studies fire in chaparral ecosystems and causes of ignitions. “The fact that you have these volunteers doing that — it is exactly what I would recommend.” Advertisement The modern-day tale of fire in California often goes something like this: Through centuries of fire suppression, the state’s wildlands have built up a dangerous level of thick, flammable vegetation, requiring us to introduce more frequent, less intense controlled burns and forest thinning to limit the severity of major fires. Despite the state’s best efforts to suppress fire, the number of ignitions has become increasingly frequent in the region as Californians continued to build into the wildlands and create more opportunities for sparks. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) All of Orange County Fire Watch’s sentinels started as volunteers with the county parks or the Irvine Ranch Conservancy, which boast pools of 1,200 and 500 volunteers, respectively. It gives them everything they need to quickly and confidently identify fires, discern their exact location and effectively alert the Orange County Fire Authority (which gives the program its full blessings). In 2023, Cal Fire partnered with UC San Diego to bring artificial intelligence to the university’s more than 1,100 remote cameras strategically placed throughout the state to monitor for fires. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched the latest of its GOES satellites in 2024, which scan the Earth every 10 minutes for fires and other extreme weather events. In July, the Google- and Cal Fire-backed Earth Fire Alliance unveiled the first images from a prototype satellite for its FireSat constellation that will scan fire-prone regions every 20 minutes with significantly better resolution. (NOAA / Lockheed Martin) Advertisement The Irvine Ranch Conservancy, which houses the fire watch program, has even partnered with a high school student who designed a network of sensors capable of detecting the heat and smoke of new fire starts. Computers, sensors and AI “can’t talk to the public and say, ‘Hey, did you know about these red flag warning conditions?’” said Funtanilla, program coordinator for Orange County Fire Watch. “There’s definitely value to that human touch of having a person stationed with this yellow vest that someone from the public can actually ask questions.” Orange County Fire Watch volunteer Phil Sallaway holds binoculars during a mock deployment at Ridge Park. Researchers could start by counting the number of potential ignitions avoided — like when an Orange County Fire Watch volunteer caught a car with a damaged wheel rim creating sparks on the road — but that wouldn’t account for the effect of deterrence. Advertisement Eventually, researchers could look at Orange County Fire Watch’s footprint and see if the total number of ignitions declined when the group was activated (while also accounting for all the other factors influencing ignitions), but such a study has yet to be done.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has rejected Putin’s demands that Kyiv withdraw from the remaining 30 percent of Donetsk that it still controls, played down the Russian advances, saying on X that his forces were “countering” and “increasing the pressure” on the “occupier”. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford said that “small groups of Russian forces” had “pushed through gaps in Ukrainian defensive lines in that area, taking around 10 kilometres [6.2 miles] of territory”. Attacks traded in run-up to summit In other fighting on Friday, Russia launched a ballistic missile into Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one and wounding at least one other person, according to regional governor Serhiy Lysak.

Article: (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska -- President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia’s gains, block Kyiv’s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit. soil — America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre — the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West’s policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine’s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia’s Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV. Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before — but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting — a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to. When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.” "We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he's also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He’s not going to mess around with me.” Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. Trump said there’s “a possibility” of the United States offering Ukraine security guarantees alongside European powers, “but not in the form of NATO.” Putin has fiercely resisted Ukraine joining the trans-Atlantic security alliance, a long-term goal for Ukrainians seeking to forge stronger ties with the West. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe’s position as the toughest enemy of Russia.” Foreign governments will be watching closely to see how Trump reacts to Putin, likely gauging what the interaction might mean for their own dealings with the U.S. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia’s much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” “Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is a former senior intelligence officer. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit’s venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.” Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, file) NEW YORK -- A Brooklyn construction magnate was sentenced Friday to a year of probation for working with a Turkish government official to funnel illegal campaign contributions to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, resolving one of two related federal cases after the mayor’s criminal charges were dropped. Erden Arkan, 76, told Manhattan federal Judge Dale Ho that he regretted his “poor judgments” in engaging in the straw donor scheme, which helped Adams fraudulently obtain public money for his 2021 mayoral bid under the city’s matching funds program. Ho cited Arkan’s age and otherwise clean record in imposing the sentence, telling the Turkish-born businessman that his immigrant success story “exemplifies the American dream.” “I hope that you don’t let this one mistake define you,” Ho told Arkan. Bahi, who served as City Hall’s chief liaison to the Muslim community, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to soliciting straw donations for Adams’ mayoral campaign from employees of a different Brooklyn construction company at a December 2020 fundraiser. A well-known member of New York’s Turkish community, Arkan’s ties to Adams first emerged in November 2023 after federal investigators searched the businessman’s home, along with the home of Adams’ chief fundraiser and his liaison to the Turkish community. Adams pleaded not guilty to bribery and other charges after a 2024 indictment accused him of accepting illegal campaign contributions and travel discounts from a Turkish official and others — and returning the favors by, among other things, helping Turkey open a diplomatic building without passing fire inspections. 19 hearing that precipitated the dismissal of his case, Adams told Ho: “I have not committed a crime.” The first-term mayor, a former police captain, skipped the June Democratic primary and is currently running for reelection as an independent.

Article: Donald Trump and his minions — Tom Homan, tough guy — clearly decided, coincidentally or not, that this was a location to advance ICE arrests,” the governor told the crowd at the Japanese American National Museum. That an American president sent masked agents to a rival’s political rally is quite obviously an ominous sign for our country, but politically, it also just looks stupid for Republicans. This plays right into Newsom’s hands, it plays right into the Democratic Party’s hands, and it does the exact opposite of what the administration would want to do, which is to show that immigration forces in this country have not been politicized by Trump. Right now, polls show that while most Americans agree with the president on the issue of immigration and believe that the United States should crack down on people coming into this country illegally, his approval rating on the issue has slipped. The reason is not the administration’s underlying policies; it’s the implementation of those policies and ham-fisted attempts to intimidate, like what we saw in Los Angeles on Thursday and what we’ve seen play out across the country: agents running around with masks, sunglasses, no identification on them whatsoever, violently arresting people in the streets. Democrats appear to be doing quite well on generic ballots, and if they squint hard enough, the party may actually see a path to a Senate majority in the midterms. Under these current circumstances, there’s no reason why Democrats couldn’t win a state like Maine, which both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris carried in 2020 and 2024, winning a majority of the state's electoral votes.

Article: Embryos small but mighty, first live videos show toggle caption Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) For the first time, scientists have recorded a human embryo implanting into a womb in real time, a feat the researchers hope will lead to new ways to treat infertility and prevent miscarriages. "Being able to record a movie of something that has never been seen before, which are the early steps of life — of human life – was mind-blowing," says Samuel Ojosnegros , head of bioengineering in reproductive health at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Spain. (credit: Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)) One of the most important steps in an embryo's journey to becoming a baby is when the microscopic ball of cells implants in the uterus. So Ojosnegros and his colleagues created an artificial womb in a dish in their lab – a gel, or matrix, made of collagen, a protein found in the womb and elsewhere in the body. "It's quite stunning to see it live." That enabled the research team to start to understand how a human embryo uses enzymes to separate and penetrate the fibers in the matrix to force themselves into the uterus. "You could imagine that the embryo sends little fingers or little arms into this matrix and that can pull this embryo deeper and deeper in our matrix," says Amelie Godeau , a graduate student who helped conduct the experiment with Anna Seriola and others. toggle caption Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia The scientists were surprised by how forceful human embryos are, especially compared to mouse embryos, which appear to lie passively as a womb envelopes them. "It can explain these implantation cramps that women are feeling when the embryo implants." The researchers hope these experiments will help discover why implantation fails, a major cause of infertility and miscarriages. This is a big deal," says Amy Sparks , director of in vitro fertilization and reproductive testing laboratories at the University of Iowa and a vice president at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .

Article: However, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said on Friday that its decision would not take immediate effect, allowing lawyers representing CFPB workers and pro-consumer organizations to seek reconsideration by the full court of appeals, meaning dismissal notices were likely to have to wait for now. The decision nevertheless imperiled the employment of perhaps 1,500 workers at the CFPB whose mass dismissals were blocked in April by a trial court, which found the attempted purge violated a March injunction temporarily halting the administration's efforts to shut the CFPB down. If this decision is allowed to stand, it will shift the balance of power toward corporations at the expense of American families' financial security," Bennett said in a statement without addressing plans for further appeal. Circuit Court Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao found that, despite factual findings that the Trump administration intended to destroy the CFPB, the lower court had acted outside its authority. Other objections raised by the plaintiffs did not concern final decisions made by the agency and so could not be reviewed in court, wrote Katsas and Rao, both Trump appointees. "But it is emphatically not within the discretion of the President or his appointees to decide that the country would benefit most if there were no Bureau at all," wrote Pillard, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Trump officials have appeared to vacillate this year concerning their plans for the CFPB, with Trump and erstwhile adviser Elon Musk saying it should be eradicated outright, even though senior officials have said in court they plan to shrink the agency but let it live in some form as required by law. In court, they produced evidence and testimony showing the attempted mass dismissals of March and April were so widespread they completely vacated entire offices or left them so understaffed as to be incapable of performing functions by law, lawyers for CFPB workers and consumer advocates said in court.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — A decision on a potential state takeover of the Fort Worth Independent School District is expected in the "coming months" Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath said Friday after the release of new A-F school accountability ratings. Fort Worth ISD faces a potential state takeover after one of the district's schools, Leadership Academy at Forest Oak 6th Grade, maintained an unacceptable rating for five consecutive years, according to the 2023 TEA A-F ratings, which, under state law, triggers mandatory closure or the possibility of a state-appointed board. "You cannot have a situation where an entire generation of children are left to languish without even a modicum of an effective education, and Fort Worth, unfortunately, has reached that milestone at one of its campuses and, in fact, several of its campuses have many, many years of academically unacceptable behavior," Morath said. Overall, Fort Worth ISD received a rating of C, or 73 out of 100, this year, and Forest Oak Middle School received an overall rating of C, or 71 out of 100. Karen Molinar touted preliminary 2025 A–F accountability scores from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) released to districts that showed the district's number of F-rated campuses fell from 31 last year to 11 in 2025. But more importantly, he [Morath] is going to want to see that the changes being implemented are systemic across our system so we can keep schools out of the F rating once they improve.” Morath said the improvements the district made will be taken into account when the TEA makes a decision on a potential state takeover, which he said is expected in the coming months.

Article: President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. LIVE UPDATES: Trump to meet with Putin in Alaska For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia’s gains, block Kyiv’s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit. The exclusion of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the summit also deals a heavy blow to the West’s policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine’s mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting, a possibility that Russia hasn’t agreed to. When asked in Anchorage about Trump’s estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.” WATCH: What Trump and Putin are hoping to accomplish at summit in Alaska “We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his meeting goals In the days leading up to the summit, set for a military base near Anchorage, Trump described it as ” really a feel-out meeting.” But he’s also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He’s not going to mess around with me.” Trump said Friday his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. Trump said there’s “a possibility” of the United States offering Ukraine security guarantees alongside European powers, “but not in the form of NATO.” Putin has fiercely resisted Ukraine joining the trans-Atlantic security alliance, a long-term goal for Ukrainians seeking to forge stronger ties with the West. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe’s position as the toughest enemy of Russia.” The summit could have far-reaching implications On his way to Anchorage Thursday, Putin arrived in Magadan in Russia’s Far East, according to Russian state news agency Interfax. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visit would include meetings with the regional governor and stops at several key sites, including a stop to lay flowers at a WWII-era memorial honoring Soviet-American aviation cooperation. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia’s much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump’s posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” “Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is also a former senior intelligence officer. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit’s venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.” Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location.

Hawley called on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to preserve relevant materials, including emails, and said the probe would target "whether Meta's generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards." "Is there anything - ANYTHING - Big Tech won't do for a quick buck?" Hawley said in a post on X announcing the investigation. Hawley noted a Reuters report published Thursday that cited an internal document detailing acceptable behaviors from Meta AI chatbots that the company's staff and contract workers should permit as part of developing and training the software. The document acquired by Reuters noted that a chatbot would be permitted to hold a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old, telling the child that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply." The Meta guidelines said: "It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art')," according to the Reuters report.

Article: DALLAS — The debut feature of a young Dallas filmmaker capturing the feeling of being in your early 20s is now free to watch on YouTube after a sold-out screening at the Texas Theatre. Julian Sol Jordan, the director and star of Real Life, said he started filming the movie in the fall of 2021, after first having the seed of the idea for it in late 2021. "Not only was it headache-inducing to go through the footage, but it was also hard because I was waiting for something to reveal itself, and kind of just allowing myself to stick with something that doesn't really have an end goal," Jordan said. That's a really interesting theme, I want to explore that." The concept of Real Life, Jordan said, is someone trying to make their own movie, but failing to do so, and feeling unsure of what they need to live their life. "It first acts as a device of navigating young adulthood, but by the end of it, it becomes a means of self-destruction in a way," Jordan said about the movie. Jordan grew up shooting home movies, whether on his iPad or on a Flip camera, and eventually moved on to shooting weddings as a teenager and later making his own short films in high school. Now, Jordan said he just put in his notice at his retail job and is spending his time with his girlfriend, who is an actress and is also in the movie, working on a short film.

Article: TEAGUE, Texas — Two dogs received from Dallas Animal Services (DAS), which drew ire on social media alleging animal cruelty, have been voluntarily surrendered, evaluated and verified with no evidence of abuse, and are set to be placed with an out-of-state organization, according to Teague police. The City of Teague told WFAA in a statement that the dogs' owner voluntarily surrendered both animals to Teague Animal Control, and a rescue volunteer assisted in transporting the dogs to DAS, the facility where they were originally received. In the statement previously released by DAS, the Dallas Police Department Animal Cruelty Unit reviewed the incident and "found no signs of animal cruelty." DAS said they also contacted the local police department to request a welfare check, where that unnamed department also reported that they found no evidence to support any criminal activity related to animal cruelty. When the dogs were transferred back to DAS, the DAS veterinary staff conducted a thorough evaluation and verified that the dogs are healthy and receiving appropriate care, Teague police said.

Article: “The Dodgers are the dragon up the freeway we’re trying to slay,” Seidler said in August 2022, during an in-game interview with ESPN as the two teams played a “Sunday Night Baseball” game at Chavez Ravine. Dodgers Contentious Dodgers-Padres series ends with benches clearing and managers ejected Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gets into a heated argument with Padres manager Mike Shildt and the benches clear in the ninth inning of the Dodgers’ 5-3 loss. I think that with that, that certainly brings out emotion.” While the Dodgers have quelled similar challenges during their decade-long reign in the division, the Padres have proved to be a different kind of foil — coupling a contrast in style and culture with enough staying power to fuel increasingly contentious bouts. “It’s just two contrasting styles,” third baseman Max Muncy said, “that have just grown into this beast.” There was the Dodgers’ sweep of the Padres in the 2020 NL Division Series, then the Padres’ payback in a postseason upset two years later. Advertisement This year, more tinder has been added to the fire, thanks to a flurry of hit batters and a benches-clearing melee during a series at Dodger Stadium in June. And this week, ahead of a 10-day stretch in which the clubs will play their final two regular-season series, the Padres provided another plot twist, erasing what once felt like an insurmountable nine-game deficit in the standings to arrive in Los Angeles with a stunning NL West lead. But it feels every time we face each other, even in the regular season, it’s a big spot.” While the Dodgers and Padres have shared a division since the latter’s founding in 1969, much of their co-existence featured very little shared history. There was one close division race between the clubs in 1996, when the Padres swept the Dodgers in the final series of the season to claim the NL West by one game. While Manny Machado was productive during his brief Dodgers tenure at the end of 2018, helping the club win a second straight NL pennant, his style of play was an awkward fit with the team. Obviously, it’s an exclamation point here today with the signing of Manny.” Advertisement And in the six years since, the Padres have been crafted in his fiery image; built around similarly unabashed stars such as Fernando Tatis Jr., Jackson Merrill, Jurickson Profar and Joe Musgrove. You started seeing that in the games.” The Dodgers’ perpetual perch atop the standings stoked San Diego, too, making the Padres’ performance in the long-dormant rivalry a manifestation of their championship ambitions. “When I was there, we always wanted to beat the Dodgers,” said Blake Snell, who played for San Diego from 2021 to 2023 and will face them for the first time since joining the Dodgers on Saturday in Los Angeles. “Because that’s the team you gotta go through to get to the World Series.” Advertisement That dynamic was evident in the 2022 playoffs, when the underdog Padres conjured an intensity the Dodgers couldn’t match. Dodgers Shohei Ohtani focused ‘on the field,’ not distraction of Hawaii real estate lawsuit News emerged that Shohei Ohtani was being sued along with his agent in Hawaii by a real estate investor and broker. It was at the forefront of last year’s October rematch, too, when the Padres ran away with a Game 2 victory punctuated by Machado throwing a ball toward Roberts in the Dodgers’ dugout, and the Chavez Ravine crowd showering trash near Padres players on the field. “What I got out of it was a bunch of dudes that showed up in front of a big, hostile crowd with stuff being thrown at them and said, ‘We’re going to talk with our play; we’re not going to back down,’” Padres manager Mike Shildt said that night. “Trying to get under your skin and trying to have the emotion come out and get you to do something that you’re not normally doing.” This time, the Dodgers responded, prevailing in a five-game series that Roberts compared to a “street fight.” On the verge of a potential slaying, his team instead breathed fire back. “I just felt last year, where they were going, how they were kind of feeling, and our mindset and psyche, we needed to kind of match their intensity,” Roberts said. Over the years, there’s been plenty of pettiness imbued into Dodgers-Padres games, from a scoreboard graphic of a crying Clayton Kershaw at Petco Park, to Will Smith’s description of the since-departed Profar as “kind of irrelevant” last year. But this June, the antagonism was ratcheted up, after the teams combined for 11 hit batters — and not-so-veiled accusations of intentionality — over seven games played in a 11-day stretch. By the time Tatis was hit in the hand in the final game of the latter series, Shildt had seen enough, shouting in Roberts’ direction as he walked onto the field to check on his star player. “Which then, I take it personal.” Machado delivered the most memorable quote of the night, cautioning the Dodgers to “set a little candle up for Tati” and “pray” he hadn’t suffered a serious injury (X-rays on Tatis’ hand came back negative). But I am a foxhole guy,” said San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt, walking with Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernandez and utilityman Kike Hernandez after a bench clearing in the ninth inning of a June 19 game. “They told me right away, obviously, we don’t like those guys a whole lot,” newlyacquired Padres reliever Mason Miller said on “Foul Territory” last week, of the message he received from his new teammates upon being traded to San Diego at the deadline.

The five charges against Bolsonaro include attempting a coup, participation in an armed criminal organisation, attempted violent abolition of the democratic order, and two counts linked to destruction of state property.

Tensions deepened when Trump linked a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian imports to his ally’s legal battle, calling the proceedings a “witch hunt” and describing Bolsonaro as an “honest man” facing “political execution”. A recent Datafolha poll found more than half of Brazilians support the decision to place Bolsonaro under house arrest, while 53 percent reject the idea that he is being politically persecuted.

Article: Children in a mental health crisis can spend days languishing in the ER toggle caption Cemile Bingol/Getty Images Children who go to emergency departments in a mental health crisis and need to be hospitalized often end up stuck there for days, a new study finds. The most common mental health crises that led to such extended stays, or boarding, were depressive disorders and suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the study published in JAMA Health Forum . Sponsor Message "So a child shows up at an emergency department with a mental health condition, [and] about one in ten times, they're staying for three days or longer," says lead study author John McConnell , director of the Center for Health Systems Effectiveness at Oregon Health and Science University. McConnell and his colleagues also found that in a handful of states, including North Carolina, Florida and Maine, as many as 25% of mental health visits led to kids boarding at the emergency department for 3-7 days. So then they wait until a child in one of the psychiatric units discharges and a bed becomes available." Many states have a shockingly low number of psychiatric beds for kids, says Marshall. "And then we have less than 200 residential beds, and that's a lower acuity treatment program that tends to be longer term." Sponsor Message "There's an enormous problem across the country with a lack of access to mental health services, both on the [inpatient and] outpatient side," says Havens. "There's nothing immediate." Most ERs don't even have a child and adolescent psychiatrist, says Havens, "because we've just never invested in the resources to have this kind of service for kids." And when children in mental health crises end up stuck in ERs for days, their symptoms can worsen even if there's a psychiatrist on staff.

Article: Whatever is the future path of monetary policy could decide what happens next for a stock market that's struggling to broaden out and extend leadership beyond the companies that have worked so far in 2025. Central bank officials from around the globe will convene next week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium , an event that will be closely watched for any clues from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as to what will happen at its remaining policy meetings this year, in September, October and December. "We think there's a possibility they do." Potentially, Fed Chair Powell could throw cold water on the market if he takes a more hawkish stance than expected at Jackson Hole next week, especially as macroeconomic concerns persist. On Friday, the major averages were each headed for a winning week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by nearly 2% and the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each up roughly 1%. This week, it was revealed there are 11 potential candidates , including Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and BlackRock chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder. This week, Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics, wrote that the Fed will likely outline an approach that abandons a policy of allowing inflation to sometimes run a little above 2% to make up for periods when inflation was lower than 2%, and instead target "a simple 2% inflation target, where it does not try to make up for past misses." Other changes could include tying its maximum employment objective more directly to its inflation goal, House said. Powell says next week at the Jackson Hole symposium — if there is a likelihood of a cut or not, and we'll see what his commentary is," Leonard, the portfolio manager, said. Yet, with August and September both months that show seasonally weaker prices, and investors continuing to scan for signs of the tariff impact on business, Wall Street is bracing for continued, near-term choppiness.

Article: A new lawsuit in federal court alleges that the Trump administration violated the law by secretly recruiting a group of people who reject the scientific consensus on climate change to write a report downplaying global warming. The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists, both environmental groups, accused the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency of “flagrant violations” of a law that governs advisory committees. It alleges that in March Chris Wright, the energy secretary, “quietly arranged for five handpicked skeptics of the effects of climate change” to form a committee called the Climate Working Group that then wrote a report downplaying the threat of rising greenhouse gas emissions.

Article: Jeff Smith's Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce by 47% during the second quarter, according to a securities filing , ending the month of June with a position worth $341.5 million. The market is taking note Friday, sending shares up 4%, because Starboard was the first activist hedge fund to start publicly pushing for changes at Salesforce in late 2022 and into 2023. "We believe this is a signal there will be another round of investor activism and increased pressure on management to refocus on growth of the core business, additional margin expansion, and hold off on dilutive M & A," Luria wrote to clients Friday. In October 2024, Smith of Starboard complimented Salesforce's profitability improvements but said he still believed "there's a lot more to go." "If they execute on this plan, the stock could turn around in the same way it did last time Starboard helped CRM steer the ship," D.A. Its decision in late May to buy data management firm Informatica for $8 billion faced some skepticism, and its quarterly results released around the same time failed to quiet the doubters. RBC Capital Markets analysts, for example, downgraded the stock and expressed concerns that Benioff was slipping back into his old habit of relying on acquisitions to stoke topline growth — a big topic of conversation during the activist battle of 2022-23. Salesforce said in May that Agentforce generates over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and has secured 8,000 deals since its launch last fall, with half of them being paid deals.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Kristen Welker outlines the stakes for the in-person meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, their first since 2019, as they arrive in Alaska. — Adam Wollner The high stakes for Trump as he comes face to face with Putin Analysis by Kristen Welker President Donald Trump’s summit today with Russian President Vladimir Putin comes with incredibly high stakes for the future of Russia’s war with Ukraine — and for Trump himself. The president seemed to be lowering expectations ahead of the face-to-face meeting, telling Fox News Radio yesterday that “there a 25% chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting.” So what does a win for Trump look like? A senior administration official also told me that Trump “is realistic that this is likely a multistep process and he’s ready and positive about this step forward.” But Western and U.S. It remains to be seen if Putin will try to cloud these talks by raising other issues on his agenda, like a nuclear arms deal and easing sanctions against Russia. All of this underscores the political risk for Trump as he navigates a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and fueled a robust debate over how long the U.S. Trump said during the 2024 campaign that he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours upon taking office, but he has acknowledged that doing so is far more complicated than he could have anticipated. A recent Wall Street Journal poll found a slim majority of voters (51%) disapproving of Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, while 41% approved (the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points). Read more on the Trump-Putin summit: Top advisers to attend Trump-Putin meeting that had been expected to be 1-on-1, by Peter Alexander ✉️ Mailbag: Where does the tariff money go? Treasury’s General Fund — something the department calls “America’s Checkbook” — and is used to finance both daily and long-term government operations, ranging from federal employee salaries to interest payments. “You can think of [tariffs revenues] as helping reduce the overall deficit, or offsetting the costs of the One Big Beautiful Bill,” said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the nonpartisan think tank Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that the tariffs could bring in as much as $1.3 trillion of net new revenues through the end of Trump’s current term, and $2.8 trillion through 2034 — though it cautions these estimates are “very rough” and intended to reflect “the general magnitude” of Trump’s overall approach to the import taxes “given the complexity of the tariffs and their impacts.” The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the chief auditing agency of the federal government, has found significant, long-running issues with how General Fund payments are tracked and reported, though it does not suggest any funds are actively being misappropriated. The Treasury, it said in March, “records transactions as a group total instead of individual balances and then processes them through a variety of systems.” It continued: “As a result, we did not have enough information to determine if the amounts reported are reliable, and therefore, the Schedules were not auditable.

Article: But Tsarnaev was among the few capital defendants whose sentences then-President Joe Biden declined to commute to life in prison, so the prospect of the convicted Boston Marathon bomber’s execution looms after the Trump administration restored the death penalty this year. Successfully opposing his petition, the Justice Department wrote that a “reasonable person would find Judge [George] O’Toole’s remarks to be typical of the praise that judges commonly offer after a jury has performed its civic duty and returned a rational verdict based on the evidence.” Now Tsarnaev is asking the full circuit to review his claim. “In extrajudicial public comments made during the pendency of Tsarnaev’s appeal, Judge O’Toole opined about the very matters that are the subject of the remand proceedings and had been a focus of pre-trial litigation — whether seated jurors gave dishonest answers during voir dire, whether they disobeyed his instructions to avoid prejudicial information on social media, whether they suffered from disqualifying bias, and whether Tsarnaev received a fair trial,” Tsarnaev wrote in his rehearing petition. While the latest petition may be a long shot, further dampening his prospects is the fact that any relief he wins at this stage would face a further appeal from the DOJ — to the Supreme Court that previously ruled against him.

Article: The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax breaks, a move that analysts said could threaten the viability of many renewable energy projects under development. President Trump’s giant domestic policy bill, which was signed into law on July 4, was already set to rapidly phase out lucrative tax credits for new wind and solar farms unless they began construction in the next 12 months. Previously, a wind or solar farm was said to have begun construction if the developer spent at least 5 percent of the project cost, which many companies did by purchasing electrical transformers or other large equipment ahead of time. guidance eliminates this so-called “5 percent safe harbor” rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.

The roadblock appeared to be loosening earlier this year, when companies like StubHub and Klarna filed their prospectuses, but then President Donald Trump roiled the markets in April with his plans for sweeping tariffs. The president's tariff agenda has since stabilized a bit, and investor money is pouring into tech, pushing the Nasdaq to record levels, up more than 40% from this year's low in April. Optimism is growing that the hefty backlog of high-valued startups will continue to clear as CEOs and venture capitalists gain confidence that the public markets will welcome their top-tier companies. Ahead of Figma's debut, NYSE president Lynn Martin told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that immense demand for that offering could "open the floodgates" for the rest of the market. And earlier this week, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told "Fast Money" that there's a "very healthy list" of companies looking to IPO in the second half of this year, ahead of the holiday season.

Article: Palestinian residents of Gaza City have come under relentless Israeli bombardment as the military prepares for a major offensive to seize and ethnically cleanse the area, barring emergency workers from reaching people trapped in the residential Zeitoun neighbourhood. Gaza civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told Al Jazeera that the Israeli army had been firing at emergency vehicles trying to reach the wounded in Zeitoun on Friday, as Israeli quadcopters dropped leaflets threatening a forced displacement. Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said Israel had been deploying “heavy artillery, drones and fighter jets”, with four neighbourhoods of Gaza City “reporting relentless bombardment shaking the ground day and night” as the military advanced its plans. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing to seize Gaza’s largest urban hub and forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to concentration zones, despite a wave of criticism from families of captives held in Gaza and their supporters, the Israeli security establishment, and a multitude of nations and organisations around the world. As the military closed in on Gaza City, it also continued attacks on other parts of the enclave, killing 44 people, including 16 aid seekers desperately seeking sustenance for their families, according to medical sources who spoke to Al Jazeera. ‘Human remains 46 days under the rubble’ Amid the reports of further Israeli killing, Al Jazeera Arabic reported that a woman in the devastated Tuffah neighbourhood east of Gaza City retrieved the body of her brother and some remains of her father from the rubble of a bombed house. The woman said that the bodies had been trapped along with 31 others since an air strike that had taken place 46 days earlier – the timeline indicating the attack occurred at the end of June. Starvation and dehydration as temperatures soar In parallel, aid seekers continued to be targeted near humanitarian distribution sites run by the GHF, with medical sources reporting 16 were killed on Friday. The United Nations human rights office said at least 1,760 Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid in Gaza since late May – a jump of several hundred since its last published figures at the beginning of August. Meanwhile, as reports emerged that another child had died of Israeli-induced starvation in the enclave, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said nearly one in five young children in Gaza City were now deemed to be malnourished. The UN has said Gaza requires the equivalent of at least 600 trucks of aid entering daily to fight off the effects of man-made starvation caused by months of total Israeli blockade. The Israeli army entity in charge of managing aid – Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories – claimed that it allowed 310 aid trucks to enter Gaza on Thursday.

Article: TARRANT COUNTY, Texas — A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Daikerlyn Alejandra Gonzalez Gonzalez, 21, on a charge of manslaughter in connection with the death of 18-year-old Ava Moore, who was struck while kayaking on Grapevine Lake in May, according to the attorney for Moore's family. The Texas Game Wardens – in collaboration with the Grapevine Police Department – arrested Gonzalez in June and she was charged with manslaughter, reckless operation and excessive speed of a personal watercraft and leaving the scene of an accident involving death. Maikel Coello Perozo, 21, was also arrested in the case for driving an older blue Toyota Corolla, with Gonzalez as a passenger, hitting multiple vehicles while leaving the parking lot, according to witnesses. This includes reviewing water patrol policies, enforcement 2 protocols, and whether proper safety measures — at the local, state, and federal levels — were in place, followed, and sufficient to protect the public.

FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation won a default judgment in their defamation lawsuit against a blogger who publicly accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset," of trying to overthrow the U.S. Gordon issued the default judgment favor of the longtime Trump loyalist Patel after Stewartson did not respond in court filings to the lawsuit, which cited a series of social media posts and other comments by Stewartson. The judge said punitive damages were warranted in the case "in part to deter Stewartson and others from engaging in defamation." "Factual criticism of, and opinions about, public figures are protected speech and must be tolerated," Gordon wrote. I just found out about the judgement from trolls on Twitter last week." He said that Patel's lawsuit, and another pending defamation complaint against him by former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn in Florida state court, are "intended to intimidate me because I have been accurately and diligently reporting on Patel and Flynn's involvement in the QAnon movement and their participation on January 6th for five years." "It is a preposterous, frivolous lawsuit and neither of them will receive a dime," Stewartson said. "In fact, I intend to pursue my own case against them for their years-long campaign of abuse of me and the legal system." The FBI said that Patel would have no comment on the decision. Patel's attorneys said in a court filing in March that after filing the suit in June 2023, Stewartson for months "dodged" accepting service of the complaint, which, as a rule, is required for a civil case to proceed.

Article: A San Francisco chef whose restaurant closed down after he was accused of being rude to a TikTok influencer is now speaking out for the first time about the viral controversy. In an interview with the San Francisco Standard, the former co-owner of Kis Cafe, in Hayes Valley, recounted his disastrous meeting with TikTok influencer Karla Marcotte, who posted a video of her “nightmare SF restaurant experience” on July 23. In her video, Marcotte said that Luke Sung, a James Beard-nominated chef, criticized her follower count and said it was a “mistake” for the restaurant’s host to invite her to the establishment. Sung said he then started looking through her TikTok page and saw an image of “creamy” spaghetti with “overcooked” steak on top that Marcotte had cooked herself, causing him to doubt her abilities as a food writer. According to Sung, Marcotte was offended after he looked through her TikTok page and told her husband, who had just arrived, that they weren’t going to eat at the restaurant. There will be consequences.” In her TikTok video, Marcotte said that Sung asked her if she had done any research into the restaurant and if she knew “who we are.” Marcotte responded that she knew it was a wine bar with small bites that didn’t have a website yet. “He goes on to say my audience and my followers are not the kind of people that are going to be at his restaurant.” Kis Cafe closed in July after Marcotte’s video went viral on social media, according to the San Francisco Standard. Regardless, I thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson in kindness and respect There are no excuses to be made, and I’ve decided it’s time for me to step away from Kis cafe permanently and in all capacities.”

Article: Fallon/AFP via Getty Images The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures , that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it. Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements. "While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently," Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website . "We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately." Sponsor Message Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause. "It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay," Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement. The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from "a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy." The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure." Mixed reviews from the EV charger world Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies. "We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape," wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. "Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs." The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was "encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers." "We're optimistic," says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. "They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program." He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space. "This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year." Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

(AP Photo/Daniel Padilla) LIMA, Peru -- LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on Friday traveled to an Amazon River island at the center of a territorial dispute with Colombia, where she affirmed Peru’s unquestionable sovereignty over the territory. “Peru’s sovereignty is not in dispute; the district of Santa Rosa de Loreto is Peruvian and will remain so.” Tensions between the neighboring countries escalated Tuesday, when Peruvian police arrested three Colombian men who were on the island doing land surveying work. Colombia’s government on Thursday demanded the immediate release of the men after a Peruvian judge freed one of them but ordered the other two remain in jail for seven days while authorities investigate them for the alleged crime of attacking national sovereignty. Petro described the arrests as a “kidnapping.” His government has said the detainees — a land surveyor and a boat driver — were conducting studies to measure the depth of bodies of water for a pier expansion in the Colombian border city of Leticia. Two days later, a Colombian military aircraft flew over the island, and on Monday, the former mayor of the Colombian city of Medellín, Daniel Quintero, planted a Colombian flag there. Peru maintains it owns Santa Rosa Island based on treaties about a century old, but Colombia disputes that ownership because the island had not yet emerged from the river at the time.

Article: Jose Luis Pelaez Inc | Digitalvision | Getty Images There's a way for student borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness to get their debt wiped away sooner than they might have expected. The opportunity allows borrowers who've hit 120 months of qualifying public service employment to submit a request to the Education Department to retroactively pay for — or "buy back" — any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment.

The teacher's union alleges the agency is blocking borrowers from their rights.) "The main issue with the PSLF Buyback program is that it is apparently a labor-intensive process to review these forms, and there isn't a lot of resources dedicated to the program," Nierman said. "So it could take a very long time for borrowers to get a response."

"The Department is working its way through this backlog while ensuring that borrowers have submitted the required 120 payments of qualifying employment," said Ellen Keast, deputy press secretary at the Education Department. "But if you can afford payments in other repayment plans, don't rely solely on the Buyback to get you to 120 qualifying payments, particularly if you only need a few months of credit to reach forgiveness," she said. Borrowers who overpay should get refunds If you continue making payments on your loans after you've applied for a buyback offer, or if the Education Department finds you've made more than the required 120 qualifying payments for PSLF, you're entitled to a refund from the government, Kantrowitz said.

The teacher's union alleges the agency is blocking borrowers from their rights.) "The Biden Administration introduced the Public Service Loan Forgiveness buy-back program to allow borrowers to 'buy' eligibility into the program — weaponizing a legal discharge plan for political purposes," said Ellen Keast, deputy press secretary at the Education Department. "Long delays in PSLF buyback processing must be corrected immediately so that public service workers who have provided essential local services are not deprived of the relief they've earned," said Jaylon Herbin, director of federal campaigns at the Center for Responsible Lending.

In an earlier special session, Texas Republicans’ initial attempt at ramming through a new congressional map — which critics argue would disenfranchise Black and Latino voters — similarly failed, with most of the Democrats absent.

Article: London’s Metropolitan Police say at least 60 people will face prosecution for “showing support” for Palestine Action, the activist group outlawed as a “terrorist organisation” last month for protesting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Since the controversial ban on July 7, more than 700 people have been detained at peaceful protests, including 522 arrested at a protest last weekend for holding signs backing the group, believed to be the largest number of arrests at a single protest in the capital’s history. People should be clear about the real-life consequences for anyone choosing to support Palestine Action.” The UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission has also warned against a “heavy-handed” approach, urging the government and police to ensure protest policing is proportionate and guided by clear legal tests. Advertisement Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley praised the rapid coordination between officers and prosecutors, saying he was “proud of how our police and CPS teams have worked so speedily together to overcome misguided attempts to overwhelm the justice system”. The assessments are very clear, this is not a non-violent organisation.” The group was banned days after claiming responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England, which the government claims caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.3 million) in damage to two aircraft. Hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in several UK cities for nearly two years, calling for an end to Israel’s war on Gaza and for the British government to stop all weapons sales to the country. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last month that the UK will recognise the state of Palestine by September unless Israel takes “substantive steps” to end its war on Gaza and commits to a lasting peace process.

In May, for instance, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) urged the Honduran government to "put an end" to the state of exception, citing systematic abuses at the hands of security forces. "The implementation of the state of exception has led to serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and raids without judicial oversight," the UN office wrote. Joaquin Mejia — an investigator with the Team for Reflection, Investigation and Communication, a Honduran human rights advocacy group — believes such abuses are a trend under the state of exception. “The biggest negative effect is what the National Commission for Human Rights registered: that, from December 2022 to December 2024, 798 complaints at the national level over human rights abuses are attributed to state security forces," Mejia said.

In a police report filed at the time of the arrest in January, police said the pilot gave off ”a strong odor of what seemed to be alcohol” and had “bloodshot, watery eyes and a flushed complexion.” In the body camera video, police talk among themselves about his results and ultimately offered to give him a blood-alcohol test.

Article: WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Teachers, social workers, nurses and other public workers would be cut off from a popular student loan cancellation program if the Trump administration finds their employer engaged in activities with a “substantial illegal purpose,” under a new federal proposal released on Friday. The proposal would give the education secretary the final say in deciding whether a group or government entity should be excluded from the program, which was created by Congress in 2007 to encourage more college graduates to enter lower-paying public service fields. President Donald Trump ordered the changes in March, saying the loan forgiveness program was steering taxpayer money to “activist organizations” that pose a threat to national security and do not serve the public.

Article: Tommy McLain, a son of the Louisiana bayou whose distinctive tenor laid over a bouncy blend of rock, zydeco, country and R&B made him the king of swamp pop in the 1950s and ’60s and later earned him a following among artists like Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe, died on July 24 in Hessmer, La. Swamp pop emerged in the late 1950s as Louisiana musicians playing rock ’n’ roll incorporated elements of their native zydeco and blues, along with the singular influence of Fats Domino and his rollicking piano sound. “Despite the fact they were singing rock ’n’ roll, they imbued it with this French Cajun feeling, which, coupled with Fats Domino’s sound, gave it a unique sound,” the music historian John Broven, the author of “South to Louisiana” (1984), said in an interview.

The indictment states that Cantrell and Vappie “developed a personal and intimate relationship” in 2021, defrauding the city as they attempted to “hide their relationship and maximise their time together”. Acting United States Attorney Michael Simpson said the pair met in an apartment while Vappie claimed to be on duty, and that Cantrell had arranged for Vappie to attend 14 trips. Cantrell allegedly lied in an affidavit that she had activated a function on her phone that automatically deleted messages in 2021, when she had not activated the feature until December 2022, one month after the media began speculating on the pair’s conduct.

Article: (AP) — The NCAA fined Michigan tens of millions of dollars Friday and suspended coach Sherrone Moore for three games for a sign-stealing scandal that has loomed over college football’s winningest program for nearly two years, including its national championship season in 2023. The NCAA said it had “overwhelming” and concerning evidence of a cover-up by Wolverines staff and noted there were “sufficient grounds for a multiyear postseason ban” against a program now considered a repeat violator. “The panel concluded that an elaborate, impermissible scouting scheme was embedded in the Michigan football program over the course of three football seasons, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and this occurred under former head coach Jim Harbaugh’s oversight,” said Norman Bay, chief hearing officer for the Division I Committee on Infractions. “What makes this case even more serious, in addition to the clear intent to impermissibly gain a substantial competitive advantage, is the elaborate effort to obstruct the investigation.” WATCH: Analyzing the University of Michigan’s $490 million sexual abuse settlement Moore, who is facing a school-imposed two-game suspension this season, will also be banned from the first game of the 2026-27 season for a total of three games. They include a $50,000 fine, a 10% fine on the football program’s budget, a 10% fine on Michigan’s 2025-26 scholarships and a fine equivalent to the anticipated loss of postseason revenue for the 2025 and 2026 seasons. Harbaugh, a former Michigan quarterback and now the coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers, faces a 10-year show-cause order following the conclusion of his previous four-year order effective Aug. “(R)espectfully, in a number of instances the decision makes fundamental errors in interpreting NCAA bylaws; and it includes a number of conclusions that are directly contrary to the evidence – or lack of evidence – in the record,” the school said. However, the true scope and scale of the scheme — including the competitive advantage it conferred — will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction and withholding of materials and information.” The NCAA does not have rules against stealing signs, but does prohibit schools from sending scouts to the games of future opponents and using electronic equipment to record another team’s signals. The scheme run by Stalions, the NCAA said, was elaborate and detailed – in fact, the NCAA said, Stalions described it as “counterintelligence” and his network of helpers was referred to as the “KGB,” a nod to the Soviet-era intelligence service. During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons, “Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan’s future regular season opponents,” the NCAA report said, noting that he bought their tickets and saying he spent some $35,000 in 2022 alone. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular season opponents occurred across 52 contests.” When asked about Stalions’ devices, accounts and documents, the NCAA said, “multiple members of the KGB stated that Stalions gave them access to his hard drives and Google drive to review videos and assist in identifying signals.” Stalions, a Naval Academy graduate, was a volunteer for Michigan’s football program for years, including when he was stationed in San Diego and slept in his car while renting his house, until Harbaugh hired him 2022. The retired captain in the Marine Corps was an analytics assistant for the Wolverines when he was suspended in October 2023, a day after the school disclosed it was under NCAA investigation. “Stalions himself described smashing his phone into 1,000 pieces and throwing it into a pond, providing false and misleading information during interviews, telling a potential witness to lie when interviewed, and some staff members, most notably Harbaugh not participating in interviews at all,” Bay said. Harbaugh failed to cooperate by refusing to provide necessary records or participating in interviews with NCAA enforcement staff.” The coaches In a notice sent to the school last year, the NCAA alleged that Moore violated rules as an assistant under Harbaugh. Harbaugh, who left the Wolverines after they won the 2023 national championship, served a three-game suspension in exchange for the Big Ten dropping its investigation into the allegations after the two ended up in court. “Harbaugh did not embrace or enforce a culture of compliance during his tenure, and his program had a contentious relationship with Michigan’s compliance office, leading coaches and staff to disregard NCAA rules.” The Wolverines open the season on Aug.

Article: Ron DeSantis signed a law in 2023, known as House Bill 1069, that set up a process for parents to challenge books for removal from school libraries that they feel are unsuitable for young readers. Last year, multiple publishing companies, Florida parents and authors filed a lawsuit seeking to thwart the bill, naming as defendants various members of the state education board and school boards in Orange and Volusia counties. “By enacting HB 1069, the Florida legislature sought to prohibit material from entering or remaining in school libraries that is not obscene for minors,” District Court Judge Carlos Mendoza said in his ruling on Wednesday, which found the section that targets descriptions of sexual conduct to be unconstitutional. He listed several examples: The following books, among others, have been removed: The Color Purple, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas, The Splendid and the Vile, I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them, On the Road, Nineteen Minutes, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, The Kite Runner, Slaughterhouse-Five, Shout, Last Night at the Telegraph Club, The Handmaid’s Tale, Native Son, Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth’s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, Water for Elephants, Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, and Homegoing. The judge said the law’s focus on books that “describe sexual content” is “overbroad” and “unconstitutional,” and he said the law “mandates the removal of books that contain even a single reference to the prohibited subject matter, regardless of the holistic value of the book individually or as part of a larger collection.” Mendoza also rejected conservatives’ argument that libraries — and the books in them — are forums for “government speech.” He wrote that “many removals at issue here are the objecting parents’ speech, not the government’s,” and that “slapping the label of government speech on book removals only serves to stifle the disfavored viewpoints.” Citing Supreme Court precedent, the judge said, “To be sure, parents have the right to ‘direct the upbringing and education of children,’ but the government cannot repackage their speech and pass it off as its own.” Mendoza declined to strike down the law completely, writing that the law’s reference to “pornographic” content can be read as synonymous with content considered “harmful to minors” under Florida law, which means some books could still be banned but only if they meet a rigorous standard for obscenity known as the “Miller Test.” The Authors’ Guild, which was a plaintiff in the suit and claims to represent more than 16,000 members, called the ruling “a sweeping victory for readers and authors.” State officials said they plan to appeal the ruling.

Article: Oklahoma’s right-wing schools chief, Ryan Walters, received a stern rebuke this week as a Trump-appointed federal judge tossed out a baseless lawsuit filed by Walters to try to silence a religious freedom organization. Walters has pushed to convert Oklahoma’s public schools into hubs of right-wing religious indoctrination, through controversies such as his promotion of Bible-infused lesson plans and his attempt to require that schools show students a propaganda video of him praying for Donald Trump and attacking liberals. The court case that was just tossed involved a lawsuit Walters filed in an attempt to stop the Freedom From Religion Foundation — an organization focused on preventing theocratic rule in the U.S. Heil wrote: The Complaint alleges that Defendant ‘has interfered with and will continue to interfere with [Plaintiffs’] statutory authority to govern Oklahoma’s public schools’ and further argues that ‘[d]eclaratory and injunctive relief is both necessary and proper to ensure that [Plaintiffs] can faithfully execute their duties, as well as protect the constitutional rights of Oklahoma’s public school students.’ ... “Plaintiffs cannot be both performing their duties by addressing the letters and impeded from performing their duties by addressing the letters.” Walters has long sought to portray himself as an archconservative, Christian champion for the erasure of church-state separations in public schools.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s capital sued to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing. The legal battle playing out Friday showed the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican presidential administration that exists in its midst. District Judge Ana Reyes indicated the law likely doesn’t allow the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like. “The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He wrote in court filings that the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally. Chief had agreed to share immigration information Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.” Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting a specific individual. She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.” ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!” Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, Matt Brown, Ashraf Khalil, Michael Kunzelman, Rebecca Santana and Will Weissert in Washington and Adriana Gomez Licon in Fort Lauderdale, Fla contributed.

Searing heat and sullied water Mahmoud al-Dibs, a father displaced from Gaza City to Muwasi, dumped water over his head from a flimsy plastic bag — one of the vessels used to carry water in the camps. The few people still possessing rooftop tanks can’t muster enough water to clean them, so what flows from their taps is yellow and unsafe, said Bushra Khalidi, an official with Oxfam, an aid group working in Gaza. “If you’re forced to drink salty, brackish water, it just does your kidneys in, and then you’re on dialysis for decades.” Deliveries average less than three liters (12.5 cups) per person per day — a fraction of the 15-liter (3.3-gallon) minimum humanitarian groups say is needed for drinking, cooking and basic hygiene.

Article: Liverpool talisman Mo Salah and fellow forward Federico Chiesa struck late goals as the Premier League champions began the defence of their title by beating Bournemouth 4-2 in a thriller on the opening night of the season at Anfield. On a bittersweet Friday evening charged with emotion after the July death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, newcomer Hugo Ekitike bagged a goal on his league debut to put the hosts ahead after 37 minutes, and Cody Gakpo doubled the lead in the 49th. But Antoine Semenyo, who was the target of racist abuse in the first half that led to a pause in the game, pulled one back for the visitors in the 64th minute and completed a double 12 minutes later to rock Liverpool and shock the home fans. However, substitute Chiesa sent the Liverpool faithful away happy with an 88th-minute strike after goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic swatted away a ball into the box by Salah, who scored himself deep into added time to wrap up the three points. Salah chased the ball past the defence before cutting inside and firing into the bottom corner with a goal that put the Egypt international joint-fourth with Andy Cole on the all-time Premier League scorers’ list with 187. He headed for The Kop stand after the final whistle and wiped away tears while applauding the fans who were singing Jota’s song to the tune of Bad Moon Rising. “Obviously, I think it was a good performance, I could do better,” said Ekitike, who held up two fingers in one hand, and made a zero with the other after his goal, a tribute to Liverpool’s Jota, who wore number 20.

Article: Yet just 14 months after Johnson’s grand announcement, and four months after the group held its first meet in Jamaica, Grand Slam Track has yet to pay many of its athletes and vendors, and Johnson acknowledged Friday that the cash crunch — what one source said was around $13 million in unpaid money to athletes alone — poses an existential threat to the fate of the circuit returning for a second season. Johnson also maintained that he is “confident about the future of Grand Slam Track.” NBC News spoke with four agents who represent multiple athletes still owed money by Grand Slam Track, who spoke on condition of anonymity to retain relationships with organizers. Otherwise, they won’t have a future.” Agents, coaches and meet organizers in track and field said their concerns about Grand Slam’s trouble go far beyond receiving the money owed from the three meets it hosted this spring in Jamaica, Florida and Philadelphia. If Grand Slam Track were ultimately successful in drawing strong ratings and crowds, there was a hope that such demand could entice more outside investors with deep pockets to pour money into a sport that often operates on shoestring budgets compared to other professional leagues. “It feels like to a lot of people that this will be a massive deterrent to future endeavors,” said Paul Doyle, a prominent athlete agent who founded and has also operated a pro track circuit, the American Track League, since 2014. I feel for them in that sense that they’re in a tough spot.” On the day Johnson announced Grand Slam Track in 2024, he was bullish but also admitted the venture would take time to generate money. “If I had an investor who said, ‘Well, I need it to be profitable in Year 2,’ I would not take their money because that’s impossible,” Johnson said in 2024. Our investors have come on and said, ‘Hey, we believe in the long-term viability of this.’” That viability has been under scrutiny ever since Grand Slam Track canceled its fourth and final meet, scheduled for June. 4, a spokesperson for Grand Slam Track said that it was “anticipating investor funds to hit our account imminently, and the athletes are our top priority.” As of Friday’s announcement, however, Grand Slam had only paid athletes for the appearance fees they were owed in Jamaica, but not any prize money. Johnson, in his statement, suggested that the funding shortfall was due to a change in circumstances “in ways beyond our control.” Johnson previously told Front Office Sports that an investor had pulled funds. “Due to our strong desire to make this right as quickly as possible, we offered dated payment timelines and have been unable to meet them,” Johnson said in Friday’s statement. That is why we are not just addressing the immediate problem; we are putting systems and partnerships in place to make sure it never happens again.” “While I am no stranger to setbacks and overcoming obstacles, as an athlete, professionally, and personally, this current situation of not being able to pay our athletes and partners has been one of the most difficult challenges I’ve ever experienced,” the statement added. In contracts with its “racers,” Grand Slam Track stated that drug testing would be completed within 21 days of each meet, and that an athlete’s promotional fee and earned prize money would be paid within 10 days of learning the doping results, according to a source. But what made Grand Slam Track different, one agent said, was that there was a belief it already had its announced $30 million in funding waiting in escrow, ready to pay as obligated.

Article: An artist on the run, an exhibition censored: How China tried to silence a Thai art show 15 minutes ago Share Save Tessa Wong BBC News, Singapore Share Save Constellation of Complicity This file picture shows an art installation by Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron. Featuring exiled artists from countries such as China, Russia and Iran, Sai says his exhibition, which opened on 26 July at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, saw repeated visits by Chinese embassy representatives, accompanied by Bangkok city officials, shortly after it opened. The email also stated they made the adjustments "due to pressure from the Chinese embassy" transmitted through the Thai foreign affairs ministry and the Bangkok city government, which is the centre's main supporter. "China opposes any attempt by anyone to use the pretext of cultural and artistic exchanges to engage in political manipulation and interfere in China's internal affairs." The statement did not address allegations that its officials had pressured Thai authorities and the arts centre. Tenzin Mingyur Paldron said his films "conveyed stories from the heart and sent a message of global solidarity", adding that the censorship was part of a Chinese "campaign of erasure and suppression" of Tibetans around the world. "Although I do support the people's will, there is no signage nor advocacy of independence [in the artwork]," said Clara Cheung, one of the artists whose names were blacked out. The fact that the Chinese Communist Party tries to shut it down proves the very point they are making." 'We realised we had to leave' Sai and his wife decided to leave Thailand as they were worried of being deported back to Myanmar, also known as Burma, where Sai believes he will be persecuted for his activism against the junta. Thailand's national police spokesman Achayon Kraithong told the BBC that he had not received any information that police officers were looking for the artist, and said the accusation was too broad to prove. The couple had eventually settled in Thailand and decided to put on their art show in Bangkok because of the large Burmese community there, and also because "Thailand plays a critical role to promote peace and stability for Myanmar... my wife and I have no choice but to seek asylum in the UK."

Putin of Russia, setting foot in the United States for the first time in a decade, had just been escorted into the country by a quartet of American fighter jets. This friendly greeting on the red carpet answered no questions about whether the two of them could reach a peace deal to end the Russian war with Ukraine — not that a deal could be reached without Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, who was not invited and whose country was being attacked by Russian forces even as Mr.

Article: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met face-to-face for almost three hours over Moscow's war in Ukraine on Friday, the Kremlin said, as the two world leaders sought an end to the deadliest conflict in Europe in 80 years. Trump's publicly stated aim for the talks was to secure a halt to the fighting and a commitment by Putin to meet swiftly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to negotiate an end to the war, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. Zelenskiy, who was not invited to the summit, and his European allies fear Trump might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict with Russia and recognizing - if only informally - Russian control over one-fifth of Ukraine. Trump hopes a truce in the 3-1/2-year-old war that Putin started will bring peace to the region as well as bolster his credentials as a global peacemaker worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize. For Putin, the summit is already a big win that he can portray as evidence that years of Western attempts to isolate Russia have unravelled and that Moscow is retaking its rightful place at the top table of international diplomacy. A conservative estimate of dead and injured in the war in Ukraine - from both sides combined - totals 1.2 million people, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said in May.

Article: The redistricting plan taking shape in Sacramento and headed toward voters in November could shift the Golden State’s political landscape for at least six years, if not longer, and sway which party controls the U.S. Advertisement The new maps, drawn by Democratic strategists and lawmakers behind closed doors, were expected to be submitted to legislative leaders by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and widely leaked on Friday. The changes would ripple across hundreds of miles of California, from the forests near the Oregon state line through the deserts of Death Valley and Palm Springs to the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding Democrats’ grip on California and further isolating Republicans. Advertisement The proposed map would concentrate Republican voters in a handful of deep-red districts and eliminate an Inland Empire congressional seat represented by the longest-serving member of California’s GOP delegation. For Democrats, the plans would boost the fortunes of up-and-coming politicians and shore up vulnerable incumbents in Congress, including two new lawmakers who won election by fewer than 1,000 votes last fall. For the state to reverse the independent redistricting process that the electorate approved in 2010, a majority of California voters would have to approve the measure, which backers are calling the “Election Rigging Response Act.” Advertisement The state Legislature, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, will consider the ballot language next week when lawmakers return from summer recess. Newsom has said that the measure would include a “trigger,” meaning the state’s maps would only take effect if a Republican state — including Texas, Florida and Indiana — approve new mid-decade maps. “We’re hopeful they don’t move forward.” Explaining the esoteric concept of redistricting and getting voters to participate in an off-year election will require that Newsom and his allies, including organized labor, launch what is expected to be an expensive campaign very quickly. “People are not focused on this.” California has no limit on campaign contributions for ballot measures, and a measure that pits Democrats against Trump, and Republicans against Newsom, could become a high-stakes, high-cost national brawl. considering the 90-day sprint.” Advertisement The ballot measure’s campaign website mentions three major funding sources thus far: Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign, the main political action committee for House Democrats in Washington, and Manhattan Beach businessman Bill Bloomfield, a longtime donor to California Democrats. Those who oppose the mid-decade redistricting are also expected to be well-funded, and will argue that this effort betrays the will of the voters who approved independent congressional redistricting in 2010. Advertisement The situation has the potential to spiral into an all-out redistricting arms race, with Trump leaning on Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Missouri to redraw their maps, while Newsom is asking the same of blue states including New York and Illinois. The map consolidates Republican voters into a smaller number of ruby-red districts known as “vote sinks.” Some conservative and rural areas would be shifted into districts where Republican voters would be diluted by high voter registration advantage for Democrats. Advertisement Members of Congress are not required to live in their districts, but there would not be an obvious seat for Calvert to run for, unless he ran against Kim or Issa. The lines are “third-world dictator stuff,” Orange County GOP chair Will O’Neill said on X, and the “slicing and dicing of Orange County cities is obscene.” In Northern California, the boundaries of Kiley’s district would shrink and dogleg into the Sacramento suburbs to add registered Democrats. Kiley said in a post on the social media site X that he expected his district to stay the same because voters would “defeat Newsom’s sham initiative and vindicate the will of California voters.” LaMalfa’s district would shift south, away from the rural and conservative areas along the Oregon border, and pick up more liberal areas in parts of Sonoma County, In Central California, boundaries would shift to shore up Reps. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster. Feeding frenzy for open seats The maps include a new congressional seat in Los Angeles County that would stretch through the southeast cities of Downey, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier and Lakewood. Advertisement In Northern California, the southern tip of LaMalfa’s district would stretch south into the Sonoma County cities of Santa Rosa and Healdsberg, home to Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire.

Article: NEW ORLEANS — Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday, making her the first New Orleans mayor charged with a federal crime while still in office. It charges them with multiple violations, including: Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud Wire Fraud Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice Obstruction of Justice False Statements False Declarations Before a Grand Jury The indictment alleges that Latoya Cantrell, the Mayor of New Orleans, and Jeffrey Paul Vappie, a member of her Executive Protection Unit (EPU), developed a personal relationship in October 2021. To conceal their relationship and maximize their time together, they allegedly created a scheme to defraud the City of New Orleans by engaging in personal activities while Vappie was on duty and being paid for providing protection. These actions included: Using an encrypted messaging platform Deleting electronic evidence Making false statements to federal law enforcement agents and a federal grand jury Lying to colleagues and making false public statements The indictment also details several specific trips and associated costs incurred by the city. A grand jury started hearing the evidence from federal prosecutors in February 2024 and returned an indictment last September against building inspector Randy Farrell, charging him with conspiring to bribe Cantrell with about $9,000 in gifts in 2019, including NFC Championship Game tickets, a lunch at Ruth’s Chris steakhouse and a cell phone, in exchange for causing the firing of a city official who had been investigating Farrell for alleged fraud. Cantrell was also implicated in the 2024 indictment of her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, who allegedly had a romantic affair with Cantrell and is charged with using that relationship to defraud the New Orleans Police Department.

And in just a few months, Japan had taken territory that had been part of the British Empire for more than a century, including Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar). "I had to choose and hope that if I joined the [British Indian] army, after the war, as they had been promising, I would get independence." Yavar Abbas/Handout Yavar as a young man So Yavar enlisted - and became one of around 2.5 million Indian soldiers to sign up. Initially he joined the 11th Sikh regiment and was posted to a "God-forsaken place" in a remote part of East Bengal, where he spent his days guarding a strategic site - and felt disappointed at the lack of action. "I found myself in a version of Dad's Army, in the company of white, middle-aged men as my fellow officers, who still considered India to be a crown colony on which they'll have continuing control for the foreseeable future." One day in the mess, Yavar spotted an advert in The Army Gazette for officers to be trained as combat cameramen. A multi-national force, in time it would number up to a million soldiers - mostly Indian, but also from other parts of the British Empire - including West and East Africa. There were British and Indians mixing with each other." Yavar would go on to film on the front lines at many major Allied-Japanese battles of the Burma campaign from 1944.

"It's bizarre to be sitting here and watching all that, and to think that I was in the middle of that." He says he cannot believe now that 80 years ago he was happy to shoot Japanese forces with his camera, as well as his gun. "I'm not very proud of that," Yavar says, "but that's how you feel when you are on the front." Yavar has something to show me, that he had found that morning. Two o'clock in the morning now, and I must go to sleep."

Article: Hugo Ekitike was Liverpool's headline act on a night of pure theatre at Anfield which was high on emotion and rich in thrilling drama, but was also played out under the shadow of allegations of racist abuse. Ekitike might face a future fight for his place only weeks after making a £70m from Eintracht Frankfurt, with Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak still on Liverpool's agenda - but he stated his case eloquently with a superb individual display that made him an instant hero on The Kop. It was a night when Liverpool's expensive transition was on display, with four Premier League newcomers including Ekitike and Florian Wirtz, as well as full-back pair Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez. The scale of change is illustrated by the fact that, excluding the inaugural 1992-93 season, Liverpool are the first reigning champions to name as many as four Premier League debutants in their opening-day starting line-up. Ekitike was the best of that quartet by a distance, throwing up a conundrum about how head coach Arne Slot will adapt should Liverpool return to Tyneside with a bid closer to the striker Newcastle rate at £150m. It may not quite beg the question of whether Liverpool actually need to make such a lavish outlay on another striker, but it will give Slot a conundrum to solve.

Article: Donald Trump apparently saw John Bolton, his former White House national security adviser, tell a national television audience this week that Russia’s Vladimir Putin has “already won” ahead of the bilateral summit in Alaska. Petersburg hasn’t been called that since 1991.) Of course, it’s difficult to take seriously the suggestion that the administration is “winning on everything,” given how badly it’s struggling on multiple fronts, but if he’s genuinely confused as to why Bolton and others have argued that Putin has “already won” ahead of the meeting near Anchorage, it’s really not that complicated. After Putin ignored the threat, Trump announced that he’d welcome the Russian dictator to American soil — a move NBC News described as “a huge win” for Putin and “a diplomatic coup.” Just days earlier, the official White House line was that Trump was willing to meet with the Russian leader, but only if Putin agreed to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This, like Trump’s sanctions threats, proved to be about as meaningful as the Republican’s campaign promises about ending the war “in 24 hours.” Indeed, whether the American president understands this or not, he’s handed Putin a victory before they even shook hands by giving the Russian exactly what he’s wanted all year: a face-to-face meeting with Trump, elevating his legitimacy — effectively putting him on equal footing with the president of the United States — after years of pariah status.

Article: Olympic champion sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson is copping a plea from the public after an ugly incident that involved her assaulting her boyfriend at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last month and being booked on a charge of misdemeanor fourth-degree domestic violence assault. Security footage of the July 27 scene at the airport shows Richardson shoving her boyfriend, Olympic sprinter Christian Coleman, into a wall and throwing something at him as the couple walked through a terminal. Though she was shoving him in full view of dozens of witnesses, including TSA agents working nearby, bodycam footage captured Richardson lying to the responding officers that she hadn’t touched Coleman. Even worse, she was recorded telling an officer, “I can definitely have evidence of him assaulting me, if possible.” It’s unclear what that refers to, as none of the surveillance footage shows Coleman making contact with Richardson. An officer who submitted a report of the incident wrote, “I was told Coleman did not want to participate any further in the investigation and declined to be a victim.” “She’s a human being and a great person,” Coleman, 29, later said of the woman he described as “the best female athlete in the world.” He said, “Does she have things that she needs to work on for herself? And I’m a type of guy, I’m in the business of extending grace and mercy and love.” Four days after Richardson was arrested, but before news of her arrest had been made public, she ran what Nick McCarvel at Olympics.com described as “a strong showing” in the 100 meters heats. She wrote that her apology “should be just as loud” as her “actions,” adding: “To Christian I love you & I am so sorry.” In her video, Richardson said she’s practicing “self-reflection” and refuses “to run away but face everything that comes to me head-on.” If we’re serious about eradicating domestic violence, then we must take what she did seriously, too. And it’s important to be consistent and say that Richardson’s aggression is not OK because she’s a woman, because she’s smaller or because she pushed Coleman instead of striking him. She won’t yet be 30 when the 2028 Olympic Games roll around, and she should be the star of arguably the most popular Olympic sport when it returns to her home country.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement “notwithstanding” city law. takeover escalates with surge in arrests and homeless encampments cleared Bondi’s new order Friday came after officials in the nation’s capital sued to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive that sought to put the police force under the full control of the federal government. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing. The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican president’s administration that exists in its midst. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like. “The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. Experts say it’s possible, but not simple The judge asked the two sides to hammer out a compromise, and promised to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn’t agree. An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally. Chief had agreed to share immigration information Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” WATCH: Trump decries crime rates, but his administration has slashed prevention efforts Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.” Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.” ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!” Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, Matt Brown, Ashraf Khalil, Michael Kunzelman, Rebecca Santana and Will Weissert in Washington and Adriana Gomez Licon in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, contributed.

Article: Houston city leaders to address Telephone Road construction project next week A construction project to redesign Telephone Road, which was scheduled to start soon, will be addressed by Houston city leaders next week. ABC13 has reported on similar delays in other city street projects since Houston Mayor John Whitmire took office last year, and many see this one as yet another attack on cyclists. RELATED: City of Houston paying to remove bike lanes in Midtown, which Harris County paid for The City of Houston is paying to remove bike lanes in Midtown, which Harris County paid for. "Having that construction right in front of our business is going to be extremely challenging to get the walk-in traffic that we need in order to sustain, so it's pretty worrisome for me," Gonzalez said. Statement from Marlene Gafrick, infrastructure advisor to Mayor Whitmire: "We need to plan for the city's future mobility needs by considering our long-term growth and densification that is associated with redevelopment. We need to take the time to design a road that will serve the residents and businesses of today and in the future." Statement from Councilmember Joachin Martinez: "I encourage community members to participate in the open house, familiarize themselves with the project scope and timeline. It will be another opportunity for the community to review information, ask questions, and share concerns with project officials."

'They need to entice younger girls' Getty Images There was always much more to a Topshop store than just the fashion One of the challenges that Topshop will face is attracting a new wave of shoppers through the doors. Getty Images The launch of a new Kate Moss Topshop collection would always draw large crowds to the flagship Oxford Street store In the 90s and 00s, designers "used to laugh at High Street fashion", said Wayne Hemingway, a designer and co-founder of Red or Dead. Topshop was only one that did." Hemingway, who worked with Topshop through its heyday, said a large part of its success was down to the team behind it, including Jane Shepherdson, its hugely influential brand director. "You cannot afford to take your finger off pulse for one minute in fashion." She added that Topshop 2.0 would benefit from the fact its core aesthetic - the London girl look - is back in style, and that not many other retailers are offering it. She added that a lot of the High Street is "playing it safe right now", and that could also work in Topshop's favour if can "get that cool edge back". "It has to be the best quality product, the most fashionable product for our customer base, and bringing that at good value." And then there are the prices Getty Images Few people will forget the buzz around the Kate Moss collection in 2007, and the red dress she wore in the window for the launch Topshop's popularity peaked in the heady years before the cost of living crisis. But she added: "We know that when we offer great fashion and great value for money then the product does sell very well, so absolutely no concerns about that to be honest." While Topshop might not churn out new pieces at the breakneck speed of its online-only rivals, in the past, it's still faced questions over its environmental record.

A report by MPs has recommended everyone under the age of 22 should get free bus travel to help them get into work and education - similar to in Scotland. 'I get hungry at college but can't afford snacks' Maisy Moazzenkivi Maisy Moazzenkivi spends £8 a day getting to and from college on the bus Maisy Moazzenkivi, 18, lives in Coventry with her mum, dad and brother, and travels almost two hours each way to get to college, four days a week. However, she still spends £8 a day on getting to college as her free travel allowance only kicks in after 09:30, half an hour after she needs to be there. "Sometimes, when I finish college I'm really hungry and just want to get a meal deal or something for the way home, but it's so expensive on top of everything. I'm very lucky that I can go home and my family can feed me, but not everyone has that." If bus travel was free, Maisy says she would be able to socialise more, and save for "luxury items". 'I don't understand how it's so extortionate' Gracie Moore Gracie Moore says she finds bus fares in the UK are 'extortionate' Gracie Moore, 22, lives in Slough and catches the bus every day to and from work, which costs her £120 a month.

Article: Indian studies challenge conventional wisdom 44 minutes ago Share Save Soutik Biswas BBC News, London Share Save Mansi Thapliyal There are over 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India As summer sweeps across India, one of the most common questions a leading Mumbai-based diabetologist hears from his patients is: "Can I eat mangoes?" "Mangoes, with their rich sweetness and diverse varieties, are a staple of Indian summers, and it's understandable why people want to indulge," says Rahul Baxi. "In fact, many patients return for follow-up visits post-mango season, often with elevated glucose levels, and sometimes, the culprit may just be overindulgence in this beloved fruit," says Dr Baxi. Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with type 2 diabetes. In India, an estimated 77 million adults have type 2 diabetes, while nearly 25 million are prediabetic and at high risk of developing the condition, according to the World Health Organization. Hindustan Times via Getty Images Mango festivals pop up across Indian cities, celebrating the fruit's cultural significance Yet amidst the challenges, new findings offer a surprising ray of hope - especially for mango lovers. A pilot study soon to appear in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition and involving 95 participants found that three popular Indian mango varities - Safeda, Dasheri and Langra - produced similar or lower glycemic responses than white bread over two hours of glucose testing. (A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.) Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango. "These studies show that within prescribed diets, consumption of mangoes are not detrimental to blood glucose and may even be beneficial," A second, eight-week randomised trial published in the Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders - conducted at Delhi's Fortis C-DOC with Indian Council of Medical Research funding - has reinforced the findings. Thirty-five adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C test (HbA1c) which measures average blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference and HDL cholesterol. "We showed the benefits of small doses of mangoes in place of carbohydrates (bread) in breakfast in two detailed studies for the first time, laying to rest all speculations regarding adverse metabolic effects of its consumption," says Prof Anoop Misra, senior author and study lead. "But the key is moderation and clinical supervision - this is not a licence for unlimited mango feasts." Bloomberg via Getty Images An estimated 77 million adults in India have type 2 diabetes I asked Prof Misra what eating mangoes in moderation meant. "If glucose levels are under control, I do allow and even encourage my patients to enjoy mangoes in limited quantities - about half portion which gives 15g carbohydrates - once or twice a day." Dr Baxi tells his patients: portion control is key - mangoes should be eaten between meals, not as dessert. Beyond its metabolic impact, the mango occupies a far larger place in Indian life - a fruit that opens doors both literally and figuratively, carrying cultural, social and even diplomatic significance.

"This is a moment for every Californian and every American of decency, regardless of party affiliation, to speak out against the abject corruption that our governor is attempting," Kiley said during a speech on the U.S. "I haven't heard much from him as it relates to the condemnation of their efforts, but I'm grateful that he recognizes the importance of a national framework." Newsom added that California's proposal would have a trigger clause and only go into effect if Texas or another red state moves forward with its own redistricting plans. "I think having mid-decade redistricting this year cascade across the country in some sort of domino effect will be a huge distraction and a very unhealthy thing for representative government." "Good government" opposition If approved, the new California districts would apply for 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, and the Citizens Redistricting Commission would regain redistricting authority after the 2030 census. "There will not be that transparency that is written into the independent commission's work and voters will suffer for that." A number of good government advocacy groups oppose Newsom's proposal, arguing it politicizes the redistricting process and disenfranchises the public by sidelining the independent commission. "We are talking about emergency measures to respond to what's happening in Texas and we will nullify what happens in Texas," Newsom said during a press conference where he hosted Texas Democrats.

Article: Class-action suit claims Otter AI secretly records private work conversations toggle caption Source: Otter A federal lawsuit seeking class-action status accuses Otter.ai of "deceptively and surreptitiously" recording private conversations that the tech company uses to train its popular transcription service without permission from the people using it. The company's AI-powered transcription service called Otter Notebook, which can do real-time transcriptions of Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams meetings, by default does not ask meeting attendees for permission to record and fails to alert participants that recordings are shared with Otter to improve its artificial intelligence systems, according to the suit filed on Friday. The plaintiff in the suit is a man named Justin Brewer of San Jacinto, Calif., who alleges his privacy was "severely invaded" upon realizing Otter was secretly recording a confidential conversation. It seeks to represent others in California who have had chats unknowingly shared with Otter, which the lawyers contend Otter does to "derive financial gain." Neither Brewer's legal team nor a spokesperson for Otter returned requests for comment. Some 25 million people now use its AI transcription tools, which have recorded and processed more than 1 billion meetings since the company was founded in 2016, the company says . Last year, an AI researcher and engineer said Otter had recorded a Zoom meeting with investors, then shared with him a transcription of the chat including "intimate, confidential details" about a business discussed after he had left the meeting. Politico's China correspondent has written about interviewing a Uyghur human rights activist using Otter and realizing that the company shares user data with third parties, raising fears over the possibility that the Chinese government could attempt to access raw transcriptions of conversations with dissidents. If someone has an Otter account and joins a virtual meeting, the software will typically ask the meeting's host for permission to record, but it does not by default ask all the other participants. "In fact, if the meeting host is an Otter accountholder who has integrated their relevant Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams accounts with Otter, an Otter Notetaker may join the meeting without obtaining the affirmative consent from any meeting participant, including the host," the lawsuit alleges. "What Otter has done is use its Otter Notetaker meeting assistant to record, transcribe, and utilize the contents of conversations without the Class members' informed consent." Otter claims that before the audio of meetings is fed into its machine learning systems to help improve an AI speech recognition feature, it is "de-identified," a method by which data can be anonymized.

Link: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/air-force-announces-new-policy-to-deny-transgender-troops-hearings-before-discharges
Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force says in a new memo that transgender airmen ousted under a recent Trump administration directive will no longer have the chance to argue before a board of their peers for the right to continue serving their country. The memo dated Tuesday says military separation boards cannot independently decide whether to keep or discharge transgender airmen and instead “must recommend separation of the member” if the airman has a diagnosis of gender dysphoria — when a person’s biological sex does not match up with their gender identity. Air Force to deny retirement pay for transgender troops being separated from service Military legal experts who have been advising transgender troops told The Associated Press that the new policy is unlawful, and while they were not aware of the other services releasing similar memos, they fear it could serve as a blueprint across the military. The service provided a statement saying the new guidance “is consistent with and responsive to Department of Defense policy regarding Service members with a diagnosis of, or history of, or exhibiting symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria.” How the boards usually work The boards traditionally offer a quasi-legal hearing to determine if a service member set to depart is still of value to the military and should stay on. The Pentagon’s policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to “fair and impartial” hearings that should be “a forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.” This impartial nature means that the boards can sometimes reach surprising conclusions. Military lawyers decry the Air Force change Priya Rashid, a military lawyer who has represented service members before hundreds of separation boards, said she “has never seen an order like this.” “I’ve seen people with three DUIs retained, I’ve seen people that beat their wives retained, I’ve seen all kinds of people retained because the board is empowered to retain anyone for any reason if they feel it’s in the best interest of the service,” she said. Rashid said the lack of an independent transcript would not only prevent Air Force leaders from reviewing the hearings to ensure they were conducted appropriately but would undercut any meaningful chance to appeal. Jamie Hash, who has served in the Air Force since 2011, said she “wanted to face an objective board to be evaluated on my years of proven capability.” “I wanted the board to see the assignments overseas and at the Pentagon, the deployments to different Combatant Commands, the service medals and the sustained operational and mission effectiveness,” she said in an interview. But now, she said, that “the path ahead feels more uncertain than it ever has.” Logan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service that includes a deployment to Afghanistan, was planning to retire early until his request was denied last week. “Now that promise is being ripped away, replaced with a process designed to decide my fate before I even walk in the room,” he said, adding that “all I’m asking for is the same fairness and justice every service member deserves.” Both Ireland and Hash said they have yet to hear from their immediate superiors on what the new policy will mean for them. Rashid said both the Army and Navy are “going to look at what the Air Force is doing as a standard of law … is this the minimum standard of law that we will afford our service members.” Transgender troops warn the policy could have wider implications Col. Bree Fram, a transgender officer in the Space Force who has long been seen as a leader among transgender troops, argued that the policy is a threat to other service members. In an online post, Fram said it “swaps judgment for automation.” ”Today it’s gender dysphoria; tomorrow it can be any condition or class the politics of the moment calls for,” she argued. If the new policy is allowed to sideline “evidence of fitness, deployment history, awards, and commander input — the very material boards were built to evaluate,” Fram said, it sends a message that performance is no longer relevant to staying in the military.

Advertisement Released Thursday, the report draws on data from local, state and federal agencies and finds that dust from the expanding dry shore of the Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of total small particle pollution in the region. Advertisement A 2023 survey by the UCR School of Medicine showed more than one in five children in communities near the Salton Sea have asthma — almost twice the state average. Since 2018, the Salton Sea no longer gets an inflow of fresh water, only agricultural runoff, so it is evaporating and shrinking while the exposed, dry lake bed area is expanding, feeding clouds of particulate. David Lo, a UC Riverside professor who has focused for years on air pollution in the region, said certain particles can be especially harmful depending on their chemical or biological makeup.

Article: TEXAS, USA — The Texas Department of Agriculture is rolling out a high-tech weapon in the fight against the New World Screwworm — a pest that poses a serious threat to the state’s $15 billion cattle industry. “This new attractant, named TDA Swormlure, marks a serious upgrade in our efforts to protect Texas livestock from the threat of the New World Screwworm, now roughly 370 miles south of Texas.” Beyond outdated methods Miller said traditional tools like the Sterile Insect Technique, used from the 1930s to the 1970s, are still helpful but no longer enough on their own.

Article: Arrest made in fatal shooting of New York man visiting Puerto Rico for Bad Bunny concert SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- An arrest has been made in the fatal shooting of a man from New York who was visiting Puerto Rico for a Bad Bunny concert. Mares was among the expected 500,000 surge of visitors traveling to Puerto Rico amid Bad Bunny's sold-out 30-concert residency, titled "No me quiero ir de aquí." Mares was fatally shot last Sunday morning in La Perla, the infamous settlement on the outskirts of Old San Juan's protective sea wall. According to investigating agent Eric Ortiz Rodriguez, of the Homicide Division of San Juan, Mares, a 25-year-old tourist from New York who was in Puerto Rico to attend the concert of singer Bad Bunny, was with friends in La Perla. The night before, he shared video of a beautiful beach view and pool party at his hotel -- but it was when he and some friends wandered off into La Perla that they found themselves in danger. His girlfriend was in Puerto Rico with him, but stayed at the hotel after the party while he and her brother and a friend ventured out -- something his parents say they'd warned him not to do.

Article: What summit means for Trump, Putin and Ukraine 60 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Watch: How the Trump-Putin summit unfolded in 82 seconds US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have left Alaska without reaching an agreement for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Three BBC correspondents who are in Anchorage for the summit assess what it means for the US and Russian leaders as well as what happens next in the war in Ukraine. Meeting dents Trump's reputation as a dealmaker By North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher "There's no deal until there's a deal," Donald Trump said early in his post-summit remarks here in Anchorage. Trump travelled a long way to only produce such vagaries, even if America's European allies and Ukrainian officials may be relieved he did not offer unilateral concessions or agreements that could have undermined future negotiations. While Trump had less at stake during these negotiations than Ukraine or Russia, it still will put a dent in his domestic and international prestige after earlier promises that this meeting had only a 25% chance of failure. The president partially addressed that in the friendly confines of a Fox News interview before flying out, saying that he would consider such a move "maybe in two weeks, three weeks".

Article: Blackpink: K-pop band make 'epic Wembley dream' come true 1 hour ago Share Save Mark Savage Music Correspondent Share Save Live Nation Blackpink are the first K-pop girl band to sell a million albums, and the first to headline Wembley Stadium. The quartet – comprised of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa – became the first K-pop girl band to headline the venue, following in the footsteps of Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, BTS and Oasis. "We're really grateful that you guys stuck around and supported us." YG Entertainment The band recently released their rave-flavoured comeback single, Jump The show was the first of two nights at Wembley Stadium, wrapping up the European leg of the band's Deadline tour, which will see them play 31 dates in 16 cities worldwide. The trek began in Seoul last month, shrewdly accompanied by a new single, Jump - which set a new milestone on YouTube for the most-watched video in a single day, with 26 million views. Killer choreography Blackpink's London show opened in a blaze of laser light and pyrotechnics, with three muscle-flexing pop anthems in a row: Kill This Love, How You Like That and Pink Venom. During Playing With Fire, the massive video wall at the back of the stage split into four, allowing for close-ups for all of the members, each followed by their own camera, as they danced around the circular catwalk for the first time. The innovative staging allowed fans to focus on their favourite member, with each receiving their own follow-cam Deadline is billed as a reunion tour, even though it's only two years since Blackpink last played in London. In the interim, the band have negotiated a new contract with South Korean agency YG Entertainment (reportedly the most lucrative record deal of 2023), received honorary MBEs from King Charles, and spent a year pursuing solo endeavours. Rosé teamed up with Bruno Mars for the global smash APT, Lisa starred in The White Lotus, Jennie went viral for her self-referential club hit Like Jennie and Jisoo took the lead role on K-drama Snowdrop. As a result, the tour alternates between group and solo sections - with British pop star FKA Twigs making a brief cameo eating a scone during a backstage prelude Rosé's set, for some reason. New Zealand-born Rosé is the cheerleader, handling most of the on-stage chat, while harbouring secret ambitions to be Taylor Swift, judging by the semi-acoustic ballads she belts out during her solo set. So while each solo set has a stand-out moment (Like Jennie is so dynamic it could power a small city; and Rosé's APT is built for a stadium-sized singalong), it's when they come together as the "One True 4" that Blackpink really shine. Jisoo / Instagram Jisoo has been posting candid photographs from behind the scenes of the tour on her Instagram page Early hits like Whistle and DDU-DU-DDU-DU are treated with the same energy and focus as recent favourites such as Lovesick Girls. Pretty Savage has some of the night's best staging, with the four singers floating in and out of picture frames, before ending the song at a golden ballet barre; while an effervescent Forever Young feels like a hymn to their friendship. The band's chemistry is particularly evident during Don't Know What To Do, as Lisa and Rosé deliberately bump into each other on the catwalk and collapse in a fit of giggles. Then, during a reprise of Jump (surely a contender for song of the summer?) the band ditch their prescribed dance moves and toss their heads back and forth like they're in a Wayne's World parody.

Article: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for nearly three hours in Anchorage, Alaska, but did not appear to reach a firm agreement on ending the war in Ukraine.

Article: Finally, President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin climbed into the back seat of Trump’s presidential limousine, casually chatting like reunited friends as they were whisked away to talks about the future of the Russia-Ukraine war. Instead it was rolled out for an adversarial leader who launched the largest land war in Europe since World War II and is seen as one of America’s most vexing foes. They offered generalities about an “understanding” and “progress,” while praising one another from podiums positioned unusually far apart before a backdrop displaying the phrase “Pursuing peace.” Trump has repeatedly implored Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine and agree to a ceasefire after insisting during last year’s campaign that he would be able to end the conflict in 24 hours. Trump made clear in recent weeks that he is unhappy with Russia’s more than 3-year-old offensive, and he had threatened “severe consequences” and additional sanctions if progress were not made Friday. Summit opens with warmth and pomp In a carefully choreographed scene at an Alaska military base, the men emerged from their respective planes nearly simultaneously and walked shoulder to shoulder along a red carpet unfurled on the tarmac. That visit ended without the leaders signing a planned deal on rare earth minerals or holding a joint news conference after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House by top Trump advisers. “You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country — this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,” Trump scolded Zelenskyy after the Ukrainian leader tried to warn Trump that Putin could not be trusted. Since then, Trump has voiced more frustration with Putin as Russian strikes on Ukraine ramped up, writing “Vladimir, STOP!” on social media and even declaring that the Russian leader “has gone absolutely CRAZY!” But little of that frustration was visible Friday at the greeting of the two leaders, who have long had a friendly relationship that Trump critics view as highly suspect. The news conference with no questions Hours later, after the meeting between officials from both countries, Trump and Putin filed into a room of journalists and the American and Russian delegations. WATCH: Trump and Putin hold joint news conference after meeting in Alaska “I say that because President Trump and I have established a strong, trusting and practical relationship,” Putin said. He reiterated Moscow’s position that it is “sincerely interested in putting an end” to the war in Ukraine — but only after “all the root causes of the crisis” are “eliminated.” “I would like to hope that the understanding we have reached will allow us to get closer to that goal and open the way to peace in Ukraine,” Putin said in Russian, without elaborating. president said “some great progress” had been made during “an extremely productive meeting.” Trump said “many points were agreed to” and that “just a very few” issues were left to resolve.

Article: But, at the same time, at the beginning of our piece, you really heard President Trump say that they had not had any agreement on some of the major issues. Those are nonstarters for Ukraine, things like capping the size of Ukraine's military or membership in Western institutions, or perhaps even the number of NATO soldiers in Eastern Europe that Putin has been complaining about for years. So, while the two presidents definitely made progress just restarting the kind of normal dialogue, in the word that many Russian officials use, a normal dialogue between Putin and Trump — and you heard at the end, of course, at the press conference Putin joke, next time, we will meet in Moscow. So, certainly a progress toward a normalized conversation, at least, but in terms of the substance of what Trump came here to get, a cease-fire in Ukraine, the substance of what Trump wanted to hear from President Putin that, yes, he was willing to end the war, it's pretty clear, Amna, tonight that President Trump did not get what he was looking for here.

He spoke at some length of Alaska’s Russian and Orthodox heritage, of the importance of turning the page in U.S.-Russian relations, of the great potential of trade between their countries (which drew a grin from Mr. Trump, who before the meeting seemed to be moving toward a newly tough position on Russia — threatening “very severe consequences” if there was no cease-fire and even suggesting that Mr. Trump said “many points were agreed to” and spoke of “great progress” and “some headway,” all without any details, but acknowledged that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.” He said he’d be calling key NATO leaders and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to give them a readout.

More broadly, he expressed satisfaction with the discussion, declaring that on a scale of 1 to 10, “the meeting was a 10 in the sense that we got along great.” Mr.

Article: Medan, Indonesia – Indonesia is celebrating 80 years of independence from Dutch colonial rule, but not everyone is in a celebratory mood, and an unusual protest movement has rallied around a cartoon pirate flag. Popularised by the hit Japanese anime One Piece, the flag has even been flown beneath the Indonesian flag – known as the merah-putih (red and white) – which is widely raised throughout the month of August in the lead-up to Independence Day on Sunday. In the anime series, which was adapted by Netflix in 2023, the hatted skull and crossbones flag is used by adventurer Monkey D Luffy – who one day hopes to become a pirate king – and is seen as a sign of hope, freedom and a pushback against authoritarianism. “Rising prices, difficulties in getting a job and the incompetencies of the government have prompted the people to use satire and sarcasm,” Radityo Dharmaputra, a lecturer in international relations at Airlangga University in Surabaya, told Al Jazeera. ‘A symbol of my disappointment and resistance’ Indonesia has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Southeast Asia, with an estimated 16 percent of the 44 million Indonesians aged 15-24 unemployed, while foreign investors are pulling capital out of the country and the government is cutting the budget. In a survey published by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore in January, about 58 percent of young Indonesians said they were optimistic about the government’s economic plans, compared with an average of 75 percent across five other countries in the region – Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. Adi*, a truck driver in the city of Malang in East Java, told Al Jazeera that he has been flying the anime pirate flag on the side of his truck for the past three weeks. Advertisement Members of his family had died, Adi said, when police fired tear gas into the Kanjuruhan Stadium in East Java’s Malang city on October 1, 2022, following what police claimed was a pitch invasion by fans at the end of a football match. ‘An attempt to divide unity’ The One Piece pirate flag has caught the attention of the government, with Budi Gunawan, the coordinating minister for political and security affairs, warning that authorities would take “firm action” if the flag was flown on Sunday’s Independence Day. Yohanes Sulaiman, a lecturer in international relations at Jenderal Achmad Yani University, told Al Jazeera that the government’s warnings were likely an attempt to clamp down on the show of symbolic dissent. He added that the increased visibility of the pirate flag comes at a sensitive time in Indonesia – ahead of Independence Day – which is traditionally a moment for the government and the public to celebrate. Advertisement Ian Wilson, a lecturer in politics and security studies at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, said the flag furore demonstrated “sensitivity around perceptions of popularity” in the current government. The flag as a symbol of protest appeared to be a more fragmented movement than recent and historical protests in Indonesia, Wilson said, which have traditionally been largely driven by students. ‘An expression of creativity’ According to reports by local Indonesian media, anime pirate flags have been seized in raids by authorities in East Java, while citizens found displaying them have been questioned in the Riau Islands. Truck driver Adi told Al Jazeera that he had seen no indications that the government’s threats had had any impact on those flying the flag and that they could still be seen prominently on display across East Java – both on trucks and buildings. For his part, Prabowo – a retired army general who oversaw crackdowns on the 1998 student protests that precipitated the fall of the country’s longtime dictator President Soeharto – said that the flag was “an expression of creativity”.

Article: LAKE WORTH, Texas — Lake Worth ISD faces a potential state takeover after the newly-released Texas Education Agency (TEA) A-F school accountability ratings for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 showed an elementary school failing for a fifth consecutive year. This would be the second school district in Tarrant County to face this intervention, as Fort Worth ISD awaits a decision from Texas Education Agency (TEA) Commissioner Mike Morath in the coming months. Under Texas law, when a school or district receives a failing grade in the state’s A-F accountability ratings for five consecutive years, it triggers mandatory closure or the possibility of a state-appointed board. A press release from Lake Worth ISD did not mention a potential state takeover, but rather said the district "recognize the challenges of being a D-rated district" and added that they "are disappointed, but we are not discouraged." “We understand where we are as a district, and we see this as an opportunity to grow,” said Armando Velazquez, Lake Worth ISD Board President. “With a clear plan, a committed team, a sense of urgency, and a belief in the potential of every student, we are confident that the work we do today will lead to a stronger, more successful tomorrow for our entire district.” Morath has not commented publicly about the status of Lake Worth ISD. School districts have challenged the state’s rating system in lawsuits, alleging that the TEA made changes to the rating system that made it more difficult to achieve a good rating, and didn’t give districts enough time to adjust.

He failed to return to his vehicle Sunday night following an attempt to rappel a waterfall at the Kern River’s Seven Teacups area, the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement on Wednesday. By the time first responders reached the area in the Sequoia National Forest on Monday, it was getting dark, and they were only able to find a possible location for the climber using infrared technology, the sheriff’s office said.

"He told Deputies he had come off his rappel lines and got trapped behind the waterfall because of the extreme hydraulics of the river." He was checked out at the scene and released to family on Tuesday following his rescue, the office said. Kevin Kemmerling told NBC affiliate KSEE of Fresno that Wardwell traveled to the waterfall with a group of friends and fellow climbers that decided to retreat after determining rappelling would be too dangerous.

Article: TORONTO, ON — More than 620 Air Canada flights, many of them international trips, have been canceled as the clock ticked closer Friday to a possible strike by flight attendants, leaving travelers stranded around the world and scrambling during the peak summer travel season. The bitter contract fight between Canada's largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu met with both the airline and union on Friday night and urged them to work harder to them to reach a deal “once and for all.” “It is unacceptable that such little progress has been made. “CUPE has engaged with the mediator to relay our willingness to continue bargaining — despite the fact that Air Canada has not countered our last two offers since Tuesday," he said in a email. Now their $8,000 trip with nonrefundable lodging is on the line as they wait to hear from Air Canada about the fate of their Saturday night flight to Nice, France. Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets. The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada." But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” How long the airline’s planes will be grounded remains to be seen.

Article: MCALLEN, Texas — A federal judge ruled Friday to deny the Trump administration's request to end a policy in place for nearly three decades that is meant to protect immigrant children in federal custody. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone," Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement. In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.” Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- The 13-year-old girl found at a northwest Harris County massage business that was being investigated for prostitution didn't work there, an attorney representing one of the girl's relatives says. In a social media post last week, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said, "a 13-year-old teen was being forced to work at the Rainbow Foot Relax Massage Parlor." But attorney Joe Wells, who represents Zou and Chow, said that's not true. Wells said Zou had left the girl in the care of an employee while she was out of town and that the teen never engaged in any of the conduct alleged in court documents.

Article: Putin insisted that “moving along this path we can reach — and the sooner the better — an end to the conflict in Ukraine.” But he did not detail the path. He was referring to the investigations into whether his 2016 campaign had colluded with Russia and the findings of a special counsel and a bipartisan Senate committee that Russia had meddled in the election in the hopes of helping him win.

Article: Even before the Intel play, this week, The Washington Post called Trump the “would-be CEO of America.” Like a college alum who can’t stay away from their old stomping grounds, President Trump has been hitting up the private sector. Talks are still early, but the Trump administration might nab a stake in the struggling chipmaker using some CHIPS Act funding—nearly $11 billion of which was already earmarked for Intel. Chip race stakes: “We don’t want government to intervene and own private enterprise, but this is national security,” one supportive tech analyst, Gil Luria, told CNBC, in reference to Uncle Sam’s clamber to be a global AI leader. But even before the Intel play, this week, the Washington Post called Trump the “would-be CEO of America.” And the Wall Street Journal’s chief economics commentator, Greg Ip, went harder, writing that “capitalism in America is starting to look like China.” It’s been an unprecedented few weeks: Trump lifted the China export block on chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices earlier this week in exchange for 15% of their China revenues. An un-Republican pattern: Economists widely say that Trump is ditching his party’s hands-off economic stance to make “the most aggressive federal incursion into the US economy” since the 2009 auto bailout, according to the New York Times.—ML

Following the Friday meeting Trump said, "There's no deal until there's a deal." Ukraine was not part of the discussions, stoking concerns that a potential deal could have compromised the country's sovereignty. "Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X prior to the summit. "There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway," Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin.

Article: in under 2 minutes Putin welcomed back on world stage with red carpet When President Vladimir Putin landed back onto the world stage on Friday, the skies in Alaska were cloudy. To cap it off, in an apparently unscripted moment, Putin decided to accept a lift to the airbase in Trump's armoured limousine instead of driving in his own Moscow-plated presidential state car. Getty Images Putin faced with questions he never gets asked In his 25 years as Russian president, Putin has achieved complete control over the media, crushing journalistic freedoms and replacing information with propaganda. Yet it was only minutes after landing in Alaska that one journalist shouted in his direction: "Will you stop killing civilians?" If the question bothered him, he didn't show it, appearing instead to shrug and diverting his gaze. During a brief and somewhat chaotic photo op, more questions were shouted, including one in Russian about whether Putin would be ready to meet President Zelensky for a trilateral summit. What was said when talks ended earlier than expected The world's media gathered in the room with Putin and Trump had been led to expect a press conference; instead, the two leaders gave statements and took no questions from reporters. They include recognition of Russian sovereignty over the Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as well as Ukraine agreeing to demilitarisation, neutrality, no foreign military involvement and new elections. Getty Images And what was not said Extraordinarily – given the context and the premise for the summit – when it was Trump's turn to speak he did not mention Ukraine or the possibility of a ceasefire once. The closest he came to referencing the conflict was saying that "five, six, seven thousand people a week" are killed and noting that Putin too wanted to see an end to the bloodshed. Then, optimistically though vaguely, he added: "But we have a very good chance of getting there." Watch: 'A long way for nothing?'

President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil but might have to "in two or three weeks." Trump has threatened sanctions on Moscow and secondary sanctions on countries that buy its oil if no moves are made to end the war in Ukraine. He was asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if he was now considering such action against Beijing after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to produce an agreement to resolve or pause Moscow's war in Ukraine.

Article: US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin ended in Alaska without a deal on halting Moscow’s war on Ukraine, but it did give the Russian president a “diplomatic win” after years of being shunned by the West, observers said. The Russian president was greeted with a red carpet and a warm handshake from President Trump on arrival at a US airbase in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday as both leaders arrived for talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. It marked President Putin’s first time stepping on Western soil since he ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and was notable in its welcoming atmosphere compared with the frosty reception a hostile Trump laid on for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in February. A visibly upbeat Putin was the first to speak, telling how he had greeted Trump on his arrival in Anchorage with the lines: “Good afternoon, dear neighbour”, owing to the geographic closeness of Alaska to Russia. Putin said his meeting with Trump was “long overdue” and that he “hoped the agreement that we’ve reached together will help us bring close that goal and will pave the path towards peace in Ukraine “. “So there is no deal until there is a deal,” Trump said, adding that he will now call up NATO as well as President Zelenskyy and others to brief them on the meeting. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the outcome of the summit, described as “anticlimactic”. No ceasefire or de-escalation has been agreed upon.” Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Anchorage, Alaska, said President Trump is likely to come in for criticism for a summit that “all became much ado about nothing”. “The only achievements that were actually made was that the Russian president has been able to continue his war, which we know is now a war of attrition and which each day favours the Russian side,” Halkett said. Also reporting from the summit, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, James Bays, said Ukraine’s European allies – who had been pushing for concrete steps to come out of the meeting, such as a ceasefire – will likely see the meeting as “a big win for President Putin”. Trump ended his remarks at the news conference on Friday by telling Putin, “I’d like to thank you very much, and we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon.” To which Putin quickly chipped back: “Next time, in Moscow.” Trump then responded, saying that he might “get a little heat on that one” but that he could “possibly see it happening”.

Putin had signaled no change in his hard-line position on Ukraine, claiming that it “has to do with fundamental threats to our security.” “We’re convinced that in order to make the settlement lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all of the primary causes of the conflict,” he said, repeating the phrasing he and other Russian officials have used to refer to a list of Kremlin positions that Ukraine — and, for the most part, the West — have called unacceptable. Trump, without elaborating, and added, “We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and will not throw a wrench in the works.” The Russian leader also gave the U.S.

Article: South African Army Chief General Rudzani Maphwanya is facing backlash in his home country following the release of alleged comments he made during an official visit to Iran, which analysts say could further complicate the already turbulent relations between South Africa and the United States. The comments, which appeared to suggest that Iran and South Africa have common military goals, come at a time when Pretoria is attempting to mend strained relations with US President Donald Trump to stabilise trade. Meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Major-General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi in Tehran on Tuesday, Maphwanya is reported to have stated that the two countries had close ties, according to Iran’s state news agency, Press TV and the Tehran Times. We always stand alongside the oppressed and defenceless people of the world.” Advertisement Maphwanya also reportedly condemned Israel’s “bombing of civilians standing in line for food” and its “ongoing aggression in the occupied West Bank”, Tehran Times reported. His visit, the publication quoted Maphwanya as saying, “carries a political message”, and comes “at the best possible time to express our heartfelt sentiments to the peace-loving people of Iran”. On the other hand, General Mousavi hailed South Africa’s genocide case against the “Zionist regime” at the International Court of Justice, and said that the effort was aligned with Iran’s policies, according to Press TV. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office on Thursday clarified that the president was not aware of General Maphwanya’s visit to Iran, although such a trip would normally be approved by the Ministry of Defence, not the president’s office. The general, in apartheid-era South Africa, served in the army wing of the African National Congress (ANC), which started as a liberation movement, and commanded a parliamentary majority until 2024. “At this period of heightened geopolitical tensions and conflict in the Middle East, one can say the visit was ill-advised, and more so, the general should have been a lot more circumspect with the comments he makes.” He added, “We are in the delicate process of resetting political relations with the US, but more importantly, balancing the trade relationship in such a manner that the trade relationship is mutually beneficial.” Similarly, the Ministry of International Relations and the Defence Ministry dissociated the government from the army chief’s alleged comments. “It is unfortunate that political and policy statements were reportedly made…The minister of defence and military veterans [Matsie Angelina Motshekga] will be engaging with General Maphwanya on his return,” a statement by the Defence Ministry on Wednesday read. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, one of the four parties that form the South African coalition government, is calling for the army chief to be tried in a military court on grounds of “gross misconduct and a flagrant breach of the SANDF [South African National Defence Force] Code of Conduct.” Advertisement “According to Iranian state media, General Maphwanya went far beyond his constitutional and professional mandate, pledging ‘common goals’ with Iran, endorsing its stance on Gaza, and calling for deeper strategic alignment,” the DA said in a statement on Thursday. The US and South Africa’s relations are at their lowest in decades, making this a particularly sensitive time, analysts say, as it follows June’s 12-day war between Iran and the US-Israel coalition. Trump has also wrongly claimed that white South Africans are being persecuted in the country under the majority Black leadership of the ANC, the country’s main political party to which President Ramaphosa belongs. In recent times, fringe, extremist Afrikaner groups claiming that whites are being targeted by Black people have emerged, pointing to cases of white farmers being attacked by criminals on their farmland. Elon Musk, Trump’s one-time adviser before their public fallout in June, had also made claims of white persecution and claimed that the South African government’s business laws were blocking his internet company from operating in the country. The latest incident echoes a 2022 scandal when a sanctioned Russian cargo ship called the Lady R docked at Simon’s Town Naval Base in the Western Cape, said analyst Chris Vandome of think tank Chatham House. Advertisement “It lies with South African foreign policy formation and the lack of clarity and consistency around it that has created this confusion whereby people think they are saying things in line with what the nation thinks,” he said. At the heated meeting, however, Trump refused to back down from his claims of white persecution, despite Ramaphosa clarifying that South Africa was facing widespread crime in general, and that there was no evidence that whites in particular were being targeted. General Maphwanya’s pronouncements this week, therefore, “couldn’t have come at a worse time” for South African diplomatic ties with the US, security analyst Jakkie Cilliers of the International Security Institute said, speaking to South African state TV, SABC. “For the chief of the national defence force to pronounce so clearly and so unequivocally at this time is remarkably politically sensitive,” Cilliers said, adding that the general could be asked to resign upon his return.

Article: In the lead-up to his much-touted Friday summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, United States President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his ability to make concrete progress towards securing a ceasefire in Ukraine at the meeting. Putin received the red carpet treatment as he was met with a lengthy handshake by Trump as he deplaned at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson military facility in the Alaskan city of Anchorage. But there was a more subdued atmosphere a few hours later as Trump and Putin departed on their respective planes – with no clear breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Here are some key takeaways from their meeting: ‘No deal until there’s a deal’ While the meeting was anticipated to take about seven hours, it wrapped up in less than three. Putin also warned Ukraine and the European Union against throwing a “wrench in the works” and cautioned against attempts to use “backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress”. “For three years they [Western media] have been talking about Russia’s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet that greeted the Russian president in the United States,” Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gloated after the summit, on Telegram. This plan, however, seems to have been derailed somewhat, with the Russian president saying in his post-meeting statement that the pair discussed their collaboration in the areas of tech and space.

Article: After initially retiring from playing in 1968, Simpson made an extraordinary comeback as Test captain in 1978 at the age of 41, after several Australian players joined the breakaway World Series Cricket competition. "Bob Simpson was one of the greats of Australian cricket, and this is a sad day for anyone fortunate to have watched him play or who benefited from his wisdom," said Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird. "As a brilliant opening batter, incredible slip fielder and handy spin bowler, Bob was a mainstay of a very strong Australian team in the 1960s, and he became a leader across the game as Australian and New South Wales captain and as a coach. "Bob's decision to come out of retirement to successfully lead the Australian team during the advent of World Series Cricket in 1977 was a wonderful service to the game, and his coaching set the foundation for a golden generation of Australian cricket." When Simpson took over as Australia coach in 1986, the side had not won a Test series for three years, but he oversaw a dramatic revival that saw them become one of the best teams of all time. A new-look team captained by Allan Border and featuring the likes of Steve Waugh and David Boon won the 1987 World Cup and secured Test series victories over England and the West Indies. In the early 1990s, Simpson oversaw the introduction of players such as Mark Waugh, Shane Warne, Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting - setting the platform for an era of Australian dominance.

Advertisement By then, Richardson had also created 21 remedies for various ailments, including Vick’s Little Liver Pills for “constipation and torpid liver”; Turtle Oil Liniment for “sprains, sores and rheumatism”; Tar Heel Sarsaparilla to purify “bad blood”; and Grippe Knockers for the flu. “Its closest rival was Ely’s Creme Balm … something of a copycat product but doesn’t seem to have had the same cachet,” explained Catharine Arnold, author of the book Pandemic 1918.

Article: Hope and disappointment as world reacts to Trump-Putin summit toggle caption Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP ANCHORAGE, Alaska – It was a summit thrown together just a week after it was first announced, marked by cinematic flourishes as the two presidents arrived at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, before walking a red carpet together as bomber and fighter jets roared overhead. toggle caption Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP "I think I don't have to think about that now," Trump said when asked about this during an interview with Fox News after the meeting. Sponsor Message Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump appeared "to have been played yet again by Vladimir Putin." In a statement released by her office , Shaheen said Trump had "rolled out a red carpet and warmly greeted a murderous dictator on American soil and reports indicate he got nothing concrete in return." Shaheen said she was "encouraged" that Trump had promised to debrief Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as European allies, but also voiced impatience. If President Trump won't act, Congress must do so decisively by passing crushing sanctions." Trump told Fox News that he expected a trilateral summit, involving both Putin and Zelenskyy, to happen soon. But she wrote on social media that she was "cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made" and said it was "encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings, which I hope will include Ukraine." South Carolinian Republican Senator Lindsey Graham echoed those sentiments, but suggested the alternatives would be disastrous for Putin and Russia. "If there's a trilateral meeting between President @realdonaldtrump, President Zelensky and Putin, then I am cautiously optimistic that this war will end well before Christmas," he wrote on X . "If the meeting doesn't happen, I think President Trump may deliver severe consequences to Putin and those who buy his oil and gas." Trump passes ball to Ukraine, and Zelenskyy After the summit, Trump also told Fox News it was now up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to "get it done" and said he would tell Zelenskyy to "make the deal." "Look: Russia is a very big power, and they're not," Trump said in the interview. "No cease-fire or any kind of de-escalation has been agreed upon." In a post on X, Zelenskyy said he had accepted an invitation to meet with Trump in Washington D.C. on Monday, "to discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war." He went on to emphasize the importance of European involvement to ensure reliable security guarantees alongside the U.S., noting "positive signals from the American side regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine's security." He added that Ukraine continues to coordinate with all partners and thanked everyone assisting in the effort. Reaction among Russia delegation At a time when President Putin is unable to visit more than 100 nations, out of fear he could be arrested thanks to warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), the trip to Alaska highlighted American exceptionalism. toggle caption Ebrahim Noroozi/AP "We expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and that they won't throw a wrench in the works," Putin added, a jab at the role many European leaders have played in supporting Zelenskyy in his dealings with the Trump White House in recent months. He said he hoped European leaders would "not make any attempts to use some backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress." Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who had travelled to Alaska too, described the meeting between Trump and Putin as "very positive," and explained that there had been no need for either leader to field questions from the small army of assembled journalists, because their statements had been "exhaustive," according to state-controlled RIA Novosti . Europeans remain key to a ceasefire In Europe, where leaders had worked hard in recent days to strengthen Ukraine's diplomatic position in the talks, despite Zelenskyy's absence, there was a degree of anger among lawmakers in some countries. Putin wanted to humiliate the US — and he succeeded." He said Trump needed to place "real pressure on Russia" if he wanted to transform a weak hand into a winning one. The comments by Putin about Europe's potential to block progress consisted of "gaslighting and veiled threats," wrote Lithuania's defense minister Dovile Sakaliene on X, noting that in the hours before the meeting, Russian forces had continued to "bomb civilians in Ukraine.

Article: The administration of US President Donald Trump has reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, DC police chief in control of the department, after Washington officials and the United States Justice Department negotiated a deal at the urging of a federal judge. Trump had placed Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control on Monday and ordered the deployment of 800 National Guard troops onto the streets of the capital, claiming a surge in crime. On Friday afternoon, a deal was hammered out at a federal court hearing after Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb had sought a court order blocking Trump’s police takeover as illegal. Trump administration lawyers conceded that Pamela Smith, the police chief appointed by DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, would remain in command of the Metropolitan Police Department, according to the accord presented by the two sides to US District Judge Ana Reyes. Meanwhile, the precise role of Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole, who had been named by Bondi as the city’s “emergency police commissioner” under Trump’s takeover bid, is still to be hashed out in further talks.

While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major US cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed. The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but DC has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Article: Now, an executive order signed by President Trump aims to lay the groundwork for an array of "alternative assets," including cryptocurrency, real estate and private equity, to be included in 401(k) and similar accounts. The order directs the Department of Labor, the Treasury, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to clear the path for such assets to find a place alongside stocks and bonds. But, you know, that doesn't mean you're getting the kind of stuff that has made other people wealthy," says Lisa Kirchenbauer, founding partner and senior advisor at Omega Wealth Management in Arlington, Virginia.

New kinds of funds have to be developed for the retail market — a process that's already underway, because 401(k) investors represent a huge new market for private equity firms and cryptocurrency companies.

Article: Bring sick and injured children to UK from Gaza immediately, MPs say More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023, according to the UN charity Unicef. The letter, co-ordinated by the Labour MP and GP Dr Simon Opher, said essential infrastructure in Gaza has been destroyed, and a long "blockade" of food, water and medical supplies and the ongoing violence has led to a medical and humanitarian catastrophe of "horrific proportion". Addressing the Health, Home and Foreign secretaries, the letter's signatories said they were working with medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders, also known as MSF) to speed up the process of bringing children with trauma injuries or serious existing conditions to the UK. Previously, The Home Office had said that biometric checks would be carried out before children and carers travel - but in the letter MPs questioned the practicality of such checks in advance of evacuation. Earlier this month the government said plans to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment were being carried out "at pace". Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory and has demanded Israel allow more aid to enter via land routes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. On Tuesday members of an international group of former leaders known as "The Elders" for the first time called the war in Gaza an "unfolding genocide" and blamed Israel for causing famine among its population.

Article: After projections that President Donald Trump’s mass deportations would negatively impact the American economy, the nation is seeing a jump in wholesale vegetable prices and slowdowns in industries that rely on immigrant workers. The latest comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported Thursday a whopping 38.9% increase in wholesale dry and fresh vegetable prices from June to July, the biggest since March 2022. Phil Kafarakis, president of IMFA The Food Away From Home Association, which represents food producers, suppliers, services and industries outside of grocery stores, said the warning signs should be taken seriously. Apu Gomes / AFP via Getty Images file Combined with drought, excessive flooding and wildfires, the deportations are coming to bear and will become a bigger problem in the late summer and early fall harvests, he said. While the administration has not yet hit the deportation levels Trump promised in his campaign, the number of people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in June was its highest monthly arrests in at least five years. In its July survey, the inability to hire qualified workers because they lacked permits or legal status “was the most widespread impact noted among firms experiencing workforce disruption," the reserve bank said. In an April report, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said the share of Texas firms reporting on its survey that they rely on workers who moved to Texas from a different country increased from 15% in 2023 to 25% in 2024. In a report released Thursday by the immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, the authors noted that the cycling of immigrant workers in and out of the country has stopped, mostly because of border restrictions reducing the inflow of immigrants. In construction, the 10 states with the highest concentrations of unauthorized workers saw employment drop .1% from June 2024 to June 2025, while other states saw it increase 1.9%, according to the report. “A loss of a significant portion of this workforce is likely to be particularly damaging as there were nearly 1 million unfilled jobs in leisure and hospitality in as recently as April of this year,” Lynch said. The numbers of foreign-born workers in the country fell from 33.3 million in January to about 32.1 million in July, a loss of about 1.2 million workers, according to analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers by the National Foundation for American Policy, a trade and immigration research group. He said that what appears to be happening is that growers are using the disruptions of immigration raids on their businesses “as their latest argument for why Congress should give them their long-standing priority, which is to bring more guest workers and pay them less.” Trump has been under pressure from businesses that rely on immigrant workers, particularly the agricultural industry, to ensure they have a secure and reliable workforce.

Article: Chimpanzees pick up communication styles from their moms, not their dads toggle caption Cathal McNaughton/PA Images via Getty Images Human communication is a complex weave of words and gestures — a mix of vocal and visual signals. "How did humans or hominins communicate hundreds of thousands of years ago, or even millions of years ago?" Mine is trying to answer that question by looking to one of our closest living relatives — chimpanzees. In a study published in the journal PLOS Biology , Mine and his colleagues conclude that young chimps learn vocal and visual patterns of communication primarily from their mothers and maternal relatives. Vocal gestural pairings Mine did his field work with the Kanyawara community of roughly 60 animals in Kibale National Park in western Uganda — "a beautiful tropical rainforest where these chimpanzees live in the wild and therefore we can observe their natural behavior," says Mine. "Just like they might combine a soft hoo vocalization with a sitting posture and maybe an arm reach." In work published last fall , Mine identified a repertoire of 108 such combinations. A lot like mom When Mine later examined chimps ten years and older — meaning subadults and adults — he found that individuals related through their mother produced similar amounts of these vocal and visual combinations. "But if that's the case for your father, then you won't necessarily show this kind of resemblance." A chimp spends most of its early years with its mom, not its dad. Then we're talking about something that might be 16, 17 million years old — so long before humans were human, apes were learning socially from each other." Hobaiter says future work could try to decode these combinations to figure out what they might mean — and whether these behaviors are specific to this group of animals or if they're perhaps shared by all chimpanzees.

Article: Bernal told NBC News in an interview that the individual represented himself as a worker for the water company and started asking for Bernal’s whereabouts, including when he’d be home and how long he had been gone. The episode was caught on the family’s home surveillance camera, and Bernal said while he doesn’t know if the person was intent on doing harm, he was certain the man misrepresented himself, as he was not wearing the customary identifiers of a water department employee. There’s been literally none of that while we faced a bomb threat, or while people are being told to hunt us down, or someone’s address might be leaked online.” The threats have been weighing on the lawmakers, who have now been away from home for nearly two weeks as they sketch out their plans to return to Texas. Gene Wu, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said one word: “Minnesota.” He was referring to a Minnesota state lawmaker who was shot and killed along with her husband earlier this year when the suspect appeared at their home. Ramon Romero Jr., who leads the Democratic Hispanic Caucus, lamented the ongoing threats and what he described as intimidation tactics from Republicans as a troubling “sign of the times.” He pointed to Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, posting a map with the location where the lawmakers were staying and GOP state Rep. Mitch Little naming the hotel they were staying in a TV interview where he said, “Whoever wants to go and get them, we fully support that effort.” “You have people that want to be famous, and because Roger Stone said, ‘This is where they are,’ the next day there’s a bomb threat at that location,” Romero said. [The Department of Public Safety] was charged with bringing them back, and that’s exactly who I was talking about.” And in a text message, Stone said that it was a news organization that first revealed the hotel where the lawmakers were staying. Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said earlier this week that the Department of Public Safety had special agents deployed in every region of the state, making clear they were prepared to take the lawmakers into custody at any moment. “Threats of violence and intimidation against elected officials have no place in our politics, and it is unfortunate that members on both sides of the aisle have been subjected to harassment,” Burrows said. “These threats will never be tolerated, and working with law enforcement, we will ensure that anyone targeting a Texas elected official or their family will face the full force of the law.” Gov. “But to suggest that calling on Democrats to return to Texas and do their jobs somehow inflames threats is absurd.” On Friday, Burrows gaveled the first special legislative session to a close and Abbott called for another one to begin hours later so lawmakers can consider, among other things, a new congressional map that could net Republicans as many as five more seats. A person close to the situation who has knowledge of the plans said Texas Democrats plan to return to their state “as soon as Monday.” They have set two conditions for their return: first, that the special session in Texas come to an end, and second that California Democrats release their own redistricting proposal.

Article: (Steve Gonzalez / California Department of Fish and Wildlife) The 5- to 7-year-old with a penchant for media coverage was recently spotted by Topanga residents with three cubs, making the quartet the first black bear family to reside in the Santa Monica Mountains in years. “Occasionally a bear ends up in someone’s backyard, a pool, up in a tree, but very [rarely] in the Santa Monica Mountains,” Jeff Sikich, a wildlife biologist with the National Park Service, said at a Topanga Town Council meeting earlier this week. Advertisement The bear is known by two designations: Yellow 2291, due to a tracking tag applied to her by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and BB-14, used by the National Park Service to indicate that she’s the 14th black bear the agency has captured, tracked or collared since 2005. By June 2024, she had been documented traveling along the 210 Freeway corridor and crossing four major highways between the Santa Susana Mountains, Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains. “For whatever reason, she took a wrong turn, it seemed like, and ended up in very urban Chatsworth where she had no immediate access route back to her habitat,” West said. Between August and September, the bear was spotted in Sylmar before returning to the Santa Susana Mountains and eventually traipsing into Malibu, where she was captured on Pepperdine University campus security footage. Sikich, the wildlife biologist, noted another bear with a large travel range: BB-12, a 4-year-old male who roamed 138 square miles over three months in 2023 before being struck and killed by a vehicle on the 101 Freeway.

Article: In Washington D.C., hundreds of National Guard troops patrolled the streets, some in armored vehicles, as city officials battled with the White House over whether the federal government can take control of the local police department. President Trump has long demonized “blue” cities like Los Angeles, Washington and New York, frequently claiming — often contrary to the evidence — that their Democratic leaders have allowed crime and blight to worsen. Advertisement But over the last few months, Trump’s rhetoric has given way to searing images of federal power on urban streets that are generating both headlines and increasing alarm in some circles. While past presidents have occasionally used the Insurrection Act to deploy the military in response to clear, acute crises, the way Trump has deployed troops in Democratic-run cities is unprecedented in American politics. Trump has claimed broader inherent powers and an authority to deploy troops to cities when and where he decides there is an emergency, said Matthew Beckmann, a political science professor at UC Irvine. The governor was preparing to announce the launch of a campaign for a ballot measure, which if approved by voters, would redraw the state’s congressional maps to favor Democrats before the 2026 midterms. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino told a Fox 11 reporter: “We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place since we won’t have politicians that’ll do that, we do that ourselves.” When the reporter noted that Newsom was nearby, Bovino responded, “I don’t know where he’s at.” However, local law enforcement sources told The Times that the raid was not random and that they had received word from the federal authorities that Little Tokyo was targeted due to its proximity to the governor’s event. After the MacArthur Park raid, Mayor Karen Bass complained “there’s no plan other than fear, chaos and politics.” Beckmann said the situation is a “particularly perilous historical moment because we have a president willing to flout constitutional limits while Congress and the court have been willing to accept pretext as principle.” UC Berkeley Political Science Professor Eric Schickler, co-director of the university’s Institute of Governmental Studies, said the recent military displays are part of a larger mission to increase the power of the president and weaken other countervailing forces, such as the dismantling of federal agencies and the weakening of universities. Advertisement “It all adds up to a picture of really trying to turn the president into the one dominant force in American politics — he is the boss of everything, he controls everything,” Schickler said. Thaddeus Johnson, a senior fellow with the Council on Criminal Justice, said the administration’s actions not only threaten democracy, but they also have real consequences for local leaders and residents. Thomas Abt, founding director of University of Maryland’s Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction, emphasized that pulling federal agents from their jobs can hurt overall public safety. “There’s a real threat to politicizing federal law enforcement, and sending them wherever elected officials think there’s a photo opportunity instead of doing the hard work of federal law enforcement,” Abt said. When federal officers set up a vehicle checkpoint along the 14th Street Northwest corridor this week, hecklers shouted, “Go home, fascists” and “Get off our streets.” On Friday, the District of Columbia filed an emergency motion seeking to block the Trump administration’s takeover of the city’s police department. On Thursday, a man apparently running from agents who showed up at a Home Depot parking lot in Monrovia was hit by a car and killed on the 210 Freeway. Bass appeared to be seething as she spoke to reporters after Newsom’s press conference on Thursday, calling the raid in Little Tokyo a “provocative act” and “unbelievably disrespectful.” Advertisement “They’re talking about disorder in Los Angeles, and they are the source of the disorder in Los Angeles right now,” she said.

Article: Environmental Protection Agency to emit a carcinogenic chemical after the Trump administration invited large emitters to bypass key provisions of the Clean Air Act by simply sending an email . The EPA in March announced that it would allow large stationary sources of air pollution — that is, sources that aren’t vehicles — to apply for an exemption that would enable them to avoid regulations that limit hazardous emissions. The nation’s top environmental agency said the exemptions could be granted under the president’s authority “if the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.” Environmental groups were outraged by the announcement — dubbing the email offer as an “inbox from hell.” As of publication, at least 340 facilities nationwide have received or applied for exemptions from the EPA, including 87 in Texas, 51 in Louisiana and 18 in Pennsylvania, according to a tracker created by the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. All three belong to Sterigenics, a company that provides industrial sterilization technology for medical devices and other commercial products at two locations in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino County. “And to the extent that these exemption requests are allowed to undermine that, or to delay and continue the pollution that people are being exposed to — that can have deadly consequences.” The Biden administration took steps to strengthen regulations for ethylene oxide under its amended air toxics standards in 2024, designed to reduce the amount of EtO released from commercial sterilizers by 90% and lessen the hazards for nearby communities. “The continued utilization of ethylene oxide by commercial sterilization facilities is essential to ensuring that our Nation provides its sick and injured with the best outcomes possible — an objective that is at the forefront of the Federal Government’s responsibility to the American people,” Trump wrote in a July executive order. Trump in that same order listed nearly 40 facilities receiving exemptions from EtO compliance deadlines for two years, including the Southern California plants belonging to Sterigenics, one in Ontario, and two across the street from each other in Vernon. In a statement, a Sterigenics spokesperson said the company “remains committed to operating safe facilities that protect patients, employees and communities.” Advertisement “The company has proactively implemented additional enhancements to further reduce already negligible levels of EtO emissions,” the statement said. “This extension to the timeline will allow Sterigenics to continue to make thoughtful, proactive investments and focus resources on ensuring stable, reliable compliance.” According to public data, the two Sterigenics plants in Vernon released a combined 78 lbs of ethylene oxide emissions in 2024, while the one in Ontario released 612 lbs. In 2022, the South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violation notices for improperly handling ethylene oxide to Sterigenics and another company called Parter Medical Products in Carson for improper handling of ethylene oxide. The Trump administration has said one reason it is issuing these exemptions is that the technology to implement these stricter standards “does not exist.” But the Biden administration would not have finalized the rules if such technology were not available, according to Ellen Robo, senior manager of clean air policy and analytics at the Environmental Defense Fund, who helped create the tracker. “And with this arbitrary designation, they are being allowed to pollute in these communities with very little notice.” Advertisement Robo said at least 10 more sterilization plants in California are governed by the ethylene oxide standards, and it’s likely that they have also applied for an exemption. “These are many of the most toxic pollutants.” The EPA’s exemption template asked applicants to explain why they can’t currently meet the emissions reduction goals and why an extension is in the national security interests of the country. The EPA said an email alone doesn’t guarantee an exemption but that the president “will make a decision on the merits.” The two-year exemptions can potentially be renewed, the agency said. While California so far has been granted fewer exemptions than some other states, it also has consistently ranked as one of the worst states for air quality in the nation, said Barrett of the American Lung Assn. The group’s most recent annual “State of the Air” report ranked San Bernardino as the nation’s most polluted county for ozone and particle pollution, while Los Angeles has been ranked the nation’s smoggiest city 25 of the last 26 years. Advertisement “For the millions and millions of people — and hundreds of thousands of children — living with asthma and other respiratory illnesses that people are dealing with on a daily basis, any erosion of the clean air protections under the Clean Air Act is a real step backward and a rejection of decades of peer-reviewed scientific literature about the harms of air pollution,” Barrett said.

(The volunteers’ last names are withheld to protect their privacy and anonymity.) “And even if we don’t have a solution for them, I feel like that is one thing that just helps them so much.” Teen Line volunteer Max, 15, speaks to The Times at Didi Hirsch Suicide Prevention Center on Monday, Aug. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) A project of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, Teen Line is helping to fill an ever-widening gap between the need for mental health support and the resources available. The “Big Beautiful Bill” that Congress passed in May proposes major cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which millions of Americans rely on to access mental healthcare for themselves and their kids. In July, the administration removed an option on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline that allowed young people identifying as LGBTQ+ to connect directly with counselors specially trained in supporting queer youth. Advertisement None of this has deterred the 60 to 70 young volunteers at Teen Line, who commit to 65 hours of initial training and a minimum of two five-hour shifts per month. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) Each evening, eight to 12 high school students file into a sunny office in Century City, often after a long day of classes, homework, practices and part-time jobs. But a call or text to Teen Line, which has its own 800 number, guarantees a response from a peer who likely understands better than most well-meaning adults what it’s like to be a teenager today. And I think that’s what teens need.” Teen Line isn’t intended to be a replacement for long-term therapy or other necessary professional services, Didi Hirsch Chief Executive Lyn Morris said. This includes teens who live in states that ban abortion and are worried that they might be pregnant, and those who tried calling the 988 suicide hotline but couldn’t get through to any operators in their state. You don’t realize how much of a relief speaking and talking about it and being listened to can have.” If you’re a young person in need of mental or emotional support, contact Teen Line by calling (800) 852-8336 from 6 p.m.

Article: The western Joshua tree conservation plan is a broad blueprint that compiles scientific research and traditional ecological knowledge to identify areas where the plant may thrive in a warmer future and plot out how to best protect that land. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen the Legislature and governor take this step to protect a species that may be imperiled in future,” said Isabel Baer, acting manager of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat conservation planning branch. Advertisement The forward-looking nature of the plan and underlying law has fueled controversy, with some local residents and politicians pointing out that the tree is currently ubiquitous in some high desert communities and questioning why it needs protecting. The law also requires property owners to obtain permits and pay fees to kill, damage or remove Joshua trees, which some fear will stifle growth and drive up the cost of living in some of the last affordable regions in Southern California. Climate & Environment State releases new plan to protect Joshua trees A new conservation plan prepared by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is a landscape-level blueprint of what’s needed to ensure the Joshua tree’s survival. San Bernardino County Supervisor Dawn Rowe, whose district includes communities surrounding Joshua Tree National Park, said the law has already stalled housing and infrastructure projects and driven away desperately-needed jobs and investments. “The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act is a blunt instrument that threatens the future of the Morongo Basin and other desert communities by imposing costly, inflexible regulations,” Rowe said in a statement. “It was written and passed by legislators with no ties to our community, who have never seen how the Joshua tree thrives and is intricately interwoven into our developed areas.” The conservation plan has drawn criticism from a coalition of local water agencies, a residents’ organization and trade groups representing realtors and farmers, who last month sent a letter to the state that called the plan “untried, and in numerous respects very confusing.” The letter demanded changes in the implementation of the plan, including exemptions or expedited permitting for projects like water distribution system repairs and maintenance. They have served as a guide for Indigenous people in both a physical and spiritual sense, with some tribes using their roots for basketry, their fibers for cordage and their petals and fruits for food, said Robert Przeklasa, executive director of the Native American Land Conservancy. The nonprofit was a partner in the creation of the plan, buoyed by a grant from the Wildlife Conservation Board that enabled tribal members to be compensated for their time and travel. “This plan is a major milestone in efforts to protect one of California’s most ecologically important and iconic species that’s facing a very, very difficult future,” said Brendan Cummings, conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity. Exactly how close a person can dig to a Joshua tree before the work triggers the fee and permitting requirements is determined by CDFW staff on a case-by-case basis depending on the project, Baer said. Advertisement Worse yet, Mackie said, since 55 of the trees will remain standing, he will have to pay again to dig near them if he wants to undertake another construction project in the future. They’ve already exempted single-family home projects from a previous requirement to relocate certain Joshua trees and are working on preparing an environmental impact analysis that will make the permitting process easier and less costly, she said. The plan is also expected to evolve, as the Fish and Game Commission is required to review its effectiveness at public meetings next year and every two years after that.

Article: But after snapping up more than $100 million in properties in the area in recent years, the Monaco billionaire has grown increasingly infuriated by delays on his development projects, including a mid-sized retail and residential development that he has been trying to get approved. Advertisement “It’s time to leave this strange community, if you can call it a community,” Pastor said in a statement after the City Council this month delayed taking any action on the development, which he named the JB Pastor project in honor of his great-grandfather. City officials, he wrote, have used “reasons that are akin to a schoolyard” to stand in his way, and it is time, he said, to “reconsider my investment in Carmel.” In Carmel-by-the-Sea, development — including upgrades to private homes — is notoriously slow. Over the last decade, Pastor has bought at least 18 properties, including The Hog’s Breath Building, the site of the pub once owned by actor and former Carmel-by-the-Sea mayor Clint Eastwood; and the L’Auberge Carmel hotel, which houses a Michelin-star restaurant. Last year, the California Coastal Commission approved his “visionary plan” to restore public access at Rocky Point, a seaside property he bought for $8 million in nearby Big Sur with views of the picturesque Rocky Creek Bridge. “I suppose we are now at the point where we need to accept we are not wanted and draw the necessary conclusions.” The city has rejected several of Pastor’s design proposals, including multiple pitches for a mixed-use development on the site of what locals call The Pit. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) Pastor bought the massive, unsightly hole in the ground — the site of a downtown construction project whose previous owners ran out of money seven years ago — for $9 million in 2020 and is still trudging through the city’s permitting process. Pastor’s most recent plans call for a 12,971-square-foot, two-story complex on Dolores Street that includes eight upstairs apartments, roughly 5,100 square feet of ground-level retail space, and a dozen parking spaces. Because it was less than 50 years old, it did not qualify as a historic structure — but after it turned 50 in October 2022, the Carmel Historic Resources Board voted to add it to the city’s historic resources list. Then, another issue arose: The project would require the removal of a small concrete wall, decorated with exposed aggregate and inlaid rocks, built in 1972 by a man local historians dubbed the “father of stamped concrete.” In the fall of 2023, the City Council said the wall was too important to be moved and sent Pastor’s company back to the drawing board. Advertisement “The plans that were submitted and approved in April are still outside of the guidelines and the rules of the city’s codes,” Courtney Kramer, one of the appellants, said during a City Council meeting Aug. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) City codes, she said, “need to be applied consistently in order to preserve this village in the forest.” During the six-hour meeting, the City Council delayed making a decision on the appeal, putting everything on hold again. Ian Martin, one of the appellants, said in an interview Friday that the push-back against Pastor’s projects is “absolutely nothing personal at all” and that longtime locals also go through the same long process. “Pastor is not being singled out.” Advertisement Eastwood, who was mayor in the 1980s, ran for office after fighting with the City Council over what he said were unreasonable restrictions on the design of an office building he wanted to erect. Chris Mitchell, managing director of Esperanza Carmel LLC, the local branch of Pastor’s international real estate company, said in a statement that “this process has made a mockery of the city’s own rules.” “Our project was reviewed for six years, redesigned five times, and approved by the Planning Commission and City staff,” he wrote. “The message from City Council is clear: it doesn’t matter how much you follow the rules, if your business is not wanted here, you won’t be treated fairly,” Mitchell wrote. Karyl Hall, co-chair of the Carmel Preservation Assn., said Pastor has bent over backward to listen to the community and to design — and redesign — his projects with the town’s traditional architectural styles in mind. She co-founded the preservation association in response to the first proposal for The Pit: a contemporary design approved by the Planning Commission for the previous owners that she called “the ice box.” Hall said she was heartened by Pastor, who proposed more traditional buildings. In an interview Thursday, she said some in town believe “that one person who owns so many properties is kind of scary.” But the billionaire, she said, has been treated unfairly. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) “The one thing we can always count on with him, which is why I’ve been supportive, is he’s done quality work and he’s done work that reflects Carmel’s character,” Hall said.

Article: On X, the Ukrainian president said he and Trump would "discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war," adding: "I am grateful for the invitation." Zelenskyy has repeatedly said a trilateral meeting with the Russian and U.S. Trump said on Saturday that it had been decided at the summit that the best way to end the war was to proceed directly to a peace deal and not press for an immediate ceasefire. In his statement after the summit, Putin did not signal any movement in Russia's maximalist position, saying it was necessary to eliminate the "root causes" of the war and address Moscow's "legitimate concerns." Oleksandr Merezhko, head of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters by phone that, on the face of it, little had changed after the summit: "As we expected, nothing happened. Putin did not back down from his ultimatum, Trump wanted to show that he is a great dealmaker, but he failed." But the lawmaker said he was worried Putin had effectively emerged from his years-long isolation from the West. With no deal reached at Friday's summit, Trump said he did not need to think about the question of sanctions "right now." Zelenskyy has repeatedly underlined the importance of security guarantees for Kyiv as part of any deal, to deter Russia from launching a new invasion at some point in the future.

Article: In this episode of For What It’s Worth, NBC Select’s live podcast, hosts Lauren Swanson, editorial director, and Zoe Malin, reporter, talk through products that ultimately won them over, plus a few they still can’t get behind. LAUREN: But she’s going to ask me face up or face down, and I’m like, face down because the embarrassing sunburn that’s on the front half of my body needs to be hidden. Sometimes it’s hard, especially when we’re doing 100 best or something like that, and you’re like, I literally have 15 sunscreens that I need to test over the next three weeks. I feel like, especially for me with leggings and sports bras when we’ve tried them in the past, I’ve had a few instances where I will wear them once, hate them and then I’ll wear them a second time and I’m like, wait, I hated that? We tried this Under Armor sports bra, and unfortunately, it had straight straps, and I was like, I’m so upset because I want to give this a great review, but I just can’t. ZOE: It’s a great sports bra and I wear it all the time, but I wasn’t taking enough time to really look at it and see what I could do to make it work. And then after talking to a bunch of running coaches and researching them so much more, I realized that the carbon plate in a running shoe doesn’t activate unless you’re over a certain speed. LAUREN: Or when we’re working from home, or even when we’re in the office, if you have a meeting and have your headphones in, then you’re like, oh, I need to refill my water bottle, and you go and you refill your water bottle, and you’re still listening. ZOE: One that I can’t get behind is the Furbo, which I know is surprising as a parent of four pets, but the spewing treats out… it’s a no from me. I don’t have one, and I was talking to someone yesterday because we were talking about how there’s this new Japanese vaccine that will keep cats alive for another 10 or 15 years. But if you’re trying something and you go into it saying, I will just see what happens, if, after a couple tries, you’re like, This is not for me, and you can’t return it or no one wants it, donate it to someplace great.

Trump declared on his social media site that Friday's meeting in Alaska "went very well." After the summit and calls early Saturday with Zelenskyy and European leaders, he wrote: "It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up." Putin has previously said that Russia is not interested in a temporary truce, and instead is seeking a long-term settlement that takes Moscow's interests into account. He thanked Trump for an invitation to meet in person in Washington on Monday and said they would "discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war." It will be Zelenskyy's first visit to the U.S. Trump confirmed the White House meeting and said that "if all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin." Trump rolled out the red carpet on Friday for Putin, who was in the U.S.

Article: And so last fall, while recovering from lung cancer, Rabinovitz ended up at her grandson's home in Burrillville, Rhode Island, where she slept on the couch and struggled to navigate the steep staircase to the shower. More people 55 and over without homes As housing costs rise, organizations responsible for people's medical care are realizing that to ensure their clients have a place to live, they must venture outside their lanes. Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania professor who specializes in homelessness and housing policy, calculated that the number of men older than 60 living in shelters almost tripled from 2010 to 2020. Freyer for KFF Health President Donald Trump's recent budget law, which makes substantial federal cuts to Medicaid, the public insurance program for those with low incomes or disabilities, will make matters worse for older people with limited incomes, said Yolanda Stevens, program and policy analyst with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. "It's an unfortunate, devastating storm for our older Americans." Adding to the challenges, the Labor Department recently halted a job training program intended to keep low-income older people in the workforce. New partners for PACE Those circumstances have sent PACE health plans throughout the country into uncharted waters, prompting them to set up shop within senior housing projects, partner with housing providers, or even join forces with nonprofit developers to build their own. But the PACE concept has always had bipartisan support, said Robert Greenwood, a senior vice president at the National PACE Association, because its services are significantly less expensive than nursing home care. The financing structure gives PACE the flexibility to do what it takes to keep participants living on their own, even if it means buying an air conditioner or taking a patient's dog to the vet. In the Detroit area, PACE Southeast Michigan, which serves 2,200 participants, partners with the owners of housing designated for senior citizens The landlords agree to keep the rent affordable, and PACE provides services to their tenants who are members. Paul's Senior Services cares for chronically homeless people as they move into housing, offering not just health services but the backup needed to keep tenants in their homes, such as guidance on paying bills on time and keeping their apartments clean. At PACE Rhode Island, which serves nearly 500 people, about 10 to 15 participants each month become homeless or at risk of homelessness, which was a rare situation five or six years ago, CEO Joan Kwiatkowski said. Freyer for KFF Health News Once a week or so, Rabinovitz rides a PACE van to the organization's center, where she gets medical care, including dental work, physical therapy, and medication — always, she said, from "incredibly loving people."

Article: Rocking O.K, well, before we vanish this week, we’re going to talk about President Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in my backyard and his taking control of Washington, D.C.‘s Metro Police force. But the thing actually is worth emphasizing about that is that most of these troops are deployed to areas surrounding the White House, National Mall Downtown, so on and so forth. But the third thing is that the fact that the president, I think is actually quite weak in a lot of ways should not diminish the fact that this is quite dangerous and that he has announced his intention to do this kind of thing in other cities, which is, I think, a pretty profound violation of basic ideas about power in the United States that go back to even before the founding. The guard is under his direct control, whereas in the United States, the guard is under the control of the governors unless the guard is federalized here, that’s don’t have to really go through that step. being carefully chosen, it’s also a city for which the president’s reliance on tropes about crime and dystopian crime and all of these things, I think is not, I wouldn’t say more effective, but there might be more willing audience for it. I think it’s similar to they pretend that Washington, DC is some kind of hellscape, as you put it, that needs to have somebody come in and just bulldoze it. I’ll say, what is interesting is there hasn’t been much polling, but the one poll I’ve seen on this has 47 percent of Americans disapproving of this action and 34 or 35 percent saying that they’re O.K with it. So I think the political aspect of this, and to go back to our conversation earlier in the summer about L.A., I think I argued, then that the public doesn’t like disorder. And when you have a couple of high profile issues that Trump can take, I think this was all provoked, because a member of the administration got his butt kicked at 3:00 a.m. And so I think when you conflate disorder, however you want to whatever you want to include in that and I’ll say some of that, it seems like some of that people include in that just like the ambient noise of cities of just like lots of humanity together. And I think it’s important to maybe to force people to specify what they mean when discussing this, but also recognizing that Congress and the administration has been quite hostile to providing D.C. So it’s all theater for the sake of a president who, as David says, wants to punish his enemies, and a president who imagines himself as a strong man doing strongman things. Although I think people experience disorder when people experience is often very deeply unsettling, and they often feel like that crime is about to happen when they’re in the presence of disorder. But I think that it’s very important to get the word out and to get the message out to American people that a blue cities are taking crime very seriously, and B, they’re actually achieving results, that good things are happening in these cities, because Trump thrives off the sense that nobody is doing anything until I came aboard. So just like Jamelle has his hobby horses, one of my hobby horses is the long tail of the pandemic and how people all just thought it was going to snap me all over. And so you’ve seen, I think the problem spiked in 2023, and we’ve been watching it go back down as they try to address what is a very real, very complicated problem that people just didn’t realize was going to last as long as it did post pandemic. But the last thing I’ll say about this, I think this is a very good point, is that in addition to militarization being not particularly helpful when it comes to dealing with problems of crime and disorder, it’s also the case that Trump’s entire rhetoric of cities opposing them as again, these hellscapes, these dystopian places, these inherently dangerous places, I think can contribute to attitudes among law enforcement that make dealing with crime more difficult. deployment and this Washington deployment, what he’s doing is introducing to the American people really a relative, a kind of a slow rollout, although not all that slow of the idea that yeah, we could see American troops and American city streets is a thing you’re going to see. This is rather than a giant invocation of the Insurrection Act and immediate descent of thousands and thousands of troops, troops into many American cities, which would trigger massive protests in response. And if a Republican president dragoons them into his political project, then the military, even if it is following lawful orders, even if unwise or the obligations, you don’t follow unlawful orders, you don’t get to judge their wisdom. I just look, I start from the premise that Donald Trump is ultimately subject to some level of political gravity, and that there are things that the public does, likes and dislikes that affect that. I think in this case, to David’s point about the danger this poses to the military and to civilian military relations, which people I think people who either have experienced the military, who have studied in an academic way. The point I make is that you are deploying American soldiers on a mission that isn’t really what they’re trained for whatsoever, and may in fact end up reducing morale. I’m reading right now the historian Andy Horowitz’s book “Katrina: A History, 1915 to 2015.” And that book, speaks of Katrina, but of hurricanes in the 60s, hurricanes beginning of the 20th century that were arguably as destructive. He has his PhD, one citation, who’s done nothing to really Marc himself as qualified for what is a genuinely important position in government and maintaining the integrity of the American economy. Like, O.K, I would love to think that Americans are getting fed up with Trump’s overreach on this, but I mean, honestly, much of the country seems to be going through some jacked up, testosterone addled. I think Trump has figured out something that is quite unsettling, which is that he does not think or care necessarily if what he does is popular, so long as he believes he’s more popular than the Democrats. Now, I think that some of that polling is deceptive, because a lot of the disaffection against the Democrats is coming from a left that is very upset with Democrats and is never going to vote Republican. And if I were in if I were in Trump’s position, I would be very jealous of maintaining my approval to accomplish my goals, but also really to prevent the bottom from falling out. If the bottom falls out in the National environment, next year is D plus 7 D plus 8, then you’ve just guaranteed yourself like a catastrophic wave election against you. So if we’re looking at that, if we’re looking at that framework, Jamelle, is there anything that you see that Democrats should be doing to increase those bumps and the car falling apart.

She said she knew that if she signed the contract, “God is going to make sure I stay out of here.” But the people who work in the clubs don’t need to be aspiring rappers to still make an impact on music. Last year, Muni Long’s track “Made for Me” became a hit at Magic City, which Dupri said helped him gauge how well the song would do more broadly, especially since traditional R&B is hard to place in clubs. “They was playing my record without my requesting it, and I said, ‘This is different.’ I believe the record was speaking for everybody that was in the club,” Ross said to NBC News. “You talking to the parking man, you talking to the dancers, you talking to the DJs.” In 2005, dancers at Magic City introduced South Carolina rapper Young Jeezy’s music to DJ Nando, who was the club’s resident DJ at the time. With the backing of BMF (Black Mafia Family) and Big Meech, author Joe Cosscarelli says in the docuseries that Jeezy became “this larger than life, King Pin figure.” Jeezy’s album “Let’s Get It: Thug Motivation 101” was the go-to record throughout Magic City dancer Gigi Maguire’s career.

Article: WASHINGTON — Washington, D.C.'s police chief is the force's top official once again, after the Trump administration rescinded an order that stripped her of power less than a day after U.S. Attorney General Brian Schwalb's office, Drug Enforcement Administration Chief Terry Cole will now be considered Bondi's "designee," instead of the emergency police chief, a position Bondi sought in her original order that claimed federal control of the department. In a new order Bondi issued Friday evening, the Department of Justice directed Bowser to order the police department to assist in immigration enforcement operations and to comply with database inquiries and requests for information from any federal law enforcement entity. "Chief Smith remains in control of the police department under the supervision of our mayor." Schwalb's office argued in its lawsuit, which also challenges President Donald Trump's order from Monday, that the initial orders exceed the limits on requesting services from D.C., which it says can be done on a temporary basis only under emergency circumstances. "This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it." The suit said that implementing Bondi's order would "upend the entire command structure of MPD and sow chaos among the more than 3,100 officers serving the District, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike." Smith said in a sworn declaration in support of Schwalb's suit that she had "never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive." "If effectuated, the Bondi Order would upend the command structure of MPD, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike," Smith said. "Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President. According to federal data released in January, violent crime in the district for 2024 was at its lowest level in more than three decades, and down 35% from the previous year. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Trump's order the "first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, DC." Under the Home Rule Act, Trump has the power to federalize the D.C.

Article: Nothing great about this for American families across the country,” Castor wrote in an August 12 X post that included a link to a CBS News story that said in its headline that the index rose in July by 2.7 percent on an annual basis. “Since at least 2021, the CPI reports have become a partisan battleground with both sides cherry picking the data to best support their argument,” said Jason Furman, an economist and professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government who previously served as an economic adviser to former President Barack Obama. “And there is so much data in the CPI report that there is always some way to slice and dice it to support just about any view.” The CPI report and its meaning For July, CPI increased 0.2 percent compared with the previous month and 2.7 percent from a year ago. Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the 2.7 percent 12-month rise in consumer prices for all items is a “bit lower than it was at the start of 2025,” to Trump’s advantage. A separate measure, core inflation – which excludes food and energy because they are considered volatile measures prone to large, rapid fluctuations – increased 0.3 percent for July and 3.1 percent from a year ago. “Economists tend to focus on the core because it is less erratic than food and energy prices,” said Dean Baker, cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Therefore, it is often more useful if we are looking for future trends to look at the core index.” Despite the uptick, the report was mild enough for investors, as US stocks closed near a record high on August 12. The long and winding road of Trump’s tariffs As the Trump administration highlights the collection of nearly $130bn from the new tariffs so far, many economists expect that businesses will begin passing on the additional costs to US customers. Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis shared with Bloomberg that US companies have so far absorbed the bulk of tariff costs – about two-thirds of the levies – while consumers absorbed about 22 percent of the costs through June. But Goldman Sachs said it expects the consumer share of the costs to soar to 67 percent by October if the tariffs follow previous patterns of how import levies affected prices. “It has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers,” Trump wrote. “But there will be a point if the tariffs stay in place at the current levels, where that just won’t be feasible any more.” Many studies of past tariffs have found that they harm the economy and raise consumer prices.

Article: Kyiv, Ukraine – The Alaska summit between United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was a masterclass in how a former intelligence officer uses his skills of manipulation on a self-centred narcissist. That’s the impression a Kyiv-based political analyst who has closely followed the war with Russia got, she told Al Jazeera, after watching the interaction between Trump and Putin during their summit on Friday, which broke no ground in stopping Europe’s hottest war since 1945. Trump literally rolled out a red carpet for Putin, gave him a long handshake and a ride in “The Beast”, the presidential limousine – and Putin beamed from the backseat. Putin flattered Trump, including by backing the US leader’s assertions – such as his claim that he could have prevented the Russian-Ukrainian war had he won the 2020 presidential vote instead of Joe Biden. “Today, President Trump was saying that had he been president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so,” the smiling Putin told reporters after the talks. “I can confirm that.” Advertisement And it was Putin’s manipulation masterfully disguised as saccharine flattery that ended the talks with Trump’s conclusion that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Kucherenko said. “He fed the narcissist with whatever one needs to feed a narcissist into manipulating him – endless quotes, the endless ‘how the American president said’, endless appellations to the topics [Trump] is interested in,” said the analyst, who has authored analytical reports on Russia’s military and has addressed the US Congress in a hearing on the war. ‘Nothing concrete’ Putin’s remarks at the news conference after the talks lasted for eight minutes and included a lecture on when czarist Russia owned Alaska and how the Soviet and US militaries partnered during World War II. “There were many, many points that we agreed on, most of them, I would say, a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite gotten there, but we’ve made some headway. As a result, the summit ended with “nothing concrete”, Kucherenko said, as Putin said the “root causes” of the war should be addressed before any ceasefire or real steps towards a peace settlement are made. “In order to make the [future peace] settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we’ve said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia,” Putin said. Advertisement As the White House wants to prevent the fusion of Moscow’s and Beijing’s interests, Trump finds it beneficial to negotiate business projects and political interactions with Moscow, Tyshkevych said. However, both Washington and Beijing wouldn’t agree with boosting Moscow’s geopolitical role to the status of a third global power, so the White House only “partially understands” Putin’s ambitions, he said. The very fact of a face-to-face with Trump on American soil means Putin was “legitimised” and raised from the role of a political pariah, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the Ukrainian military’s General Staff, told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities will need to make strategic decisions to start a “full and just” mobilisation of men of fighting age and focus the economy on military needs, Romanenko said.

Article: For weeks, Texas Democrats have been doing everything in their power to draw national attention to a radical Republican plan to try to hang on to the House of Representatives in next year's midterms by gerrymandering the state's already heavily skewed maps even further. Democrats are signaling that they might return to Texas now that the first special session is ending and California lawmakers have introduced their own redistricting plan to try to offset any new safe seats in Texas. But it has already succeeded at the real goal, which was to help voters realize what Republicans are attempting, understand the stakes and know that Democrats are trying to do something to stop it. But there are ways to do it where you're inspirational or you're saying something true and different." Talarico added that despite some national media coverage, "regular people" weren't really talking about the redistricting effort in Texas: "But once we did this quorum break, suddenly you saw Google searches for gerrymandering go through the roof, right? And now everybody is just talking about that." If you've watched Democrats closely over the last decade, you've seen the party struggle to break through, send a message and put up a fight in the new Trump-era attention economy. Forget Michelle Obama's famous advice to "go high." Voters are telling Democrats that when the other side goes low, they should be willing to go to the depths of hell to fight back. She often brings up the fact that the Montgomery bus boycott went on for months and that Texans should see things through until they are able to stop this "racist redistricting" — but she stills sees the political benefit in Democrats fighting back even if they lose. As Democrats have rallied around the stand those dozens of state lawmakers have taken, they have decided to fight fire with fire, or at least talk about it that way. Newsom, who in the past has flirted with a more conciliatory, centrist response to Trump, has even taken to urging voters to support him going further, as a new poll from Politico shows nearly two-thirds of Californians want to keep their independent redistricting commission, which would foil his plan. But the question is, will the spectacle be enough to keep momentum going for Democrats through the rest of the Trump presidency and really turn the tide for the party? Ammar Moussa, a veteran of the DNC and both the Biden and Harris presidential campaigns, says the party is on the right track, but he worries that it still doesn't come naturally.

Article: Democratic lawmakers fled the state after Trump asked Texas Republicans to guarantee the party five more congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections, even though the maps are only supposed to be redrawn every 10 years after the Census. “Look, my expectation is that courage is contagious, and we’ve seen a lot of courage out there,” Levin said, referencing Texas Democrats’ decision to leave the state and deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the gerrymandered maps. When Levin was asked if he expected Saturday’s rallies to draw similar numbers, he told Hylton: “In the fight against authoritarianism, not every single protest, not every single action, needs to match the scale or the breadth of the one before it. That’s not how you build a successful opposition to authoritarianism.” According to Levin, the success of an opposition isn't just dependent on the size of the movement, but also the ability of activists to sustain pressure: “What we’ve learned from overseas fights against autocratic rule, historical fights against autocratic rule in the South and elsewhere, is that you gotta keep on building.

Article: Last week, the White House blew past its own deadline of imposing sanctions on Russia for continuing its three-year invasion of Ukraine, and then, in a misguided effort to clean up that mistake, President Donald Trump gifted Russian President Vladimir Putin a one-on-one meeting in Alaska. Trump said he and Putin had decided not to try for a ceasefire at all, "which often times do not hold up." It’s even less apparent now what Trump wanted and expected. But after Trump and Putin met for more than two hours Friday, and then praised each other to the media for about 12 minutes, it was clear that Trump, in his rush to meet with Putin, not only risked whatever was left of his image as a dealmaker-in-chief, but he also may have damaged the United States’ image as a global champion for democracy. Trump said the two countries “haven’t quite gotten there” but “made some headway” and then landed on the tried-and-true holding statement that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.” He said, “I will call up NATO in a little while. Trump said he and Putin had decided not to try for a ceasefire at all, "which often times do not hold up," but instead work directly on a peace agreement. Notably, before the summit, Trump had upset Zelenskyy and Europe when he said, with no input from Ukraine, that in a ceasefire deal “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.” Russia elaborated that it anticipated getting control of all of eastern Ukraine. While even anodyne meetings between friendly heads of state are typically highly choreographed, with goals and discussion boundaries outlined well in advance by other officials, Trump’s freewheeling style and misplaced confidence that he has a personal relationship with Putin, a former KGB officer, created an unnecessary level of unpredictability to the proceedings in the days leading up to the so-called “Pursuing Peace” event. They’re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.” Trump’s misplaced confidence that he has a personal relationship with Putin, a former KGB officer, created an unnecessary level of unpredictability to the proceedings. When it appeared that Trump was going to walk into that meeting with Putin and offer him part of Ukraine on a platter, other countries took up the pro-democracy mantle the U.S. The European Union objected to the concept of appeasing invaders who ignore national boundaries, an experience Europeans are keen to avoid after the infamous 1938 meeting that preceded World War II. Also, after a virtual meeting with Trump and other leaders, French President Emmanuel Macron affirmed that “the territorial issue relating to Ukraine cannot and will not be negotiated by anyone but the Ukrainian president.” But Macron maintained that something needed to come out of this meeting, such as a ceasefire and a return of kidnapped Ukrainian children. The White House dramatically lowered the expectations that any ceasefire or peace settlement would be reached by referring to the summit as “a listening session,” during which Trump would simply tell Putin, “You’ve got to end this war.” Shortly before the meeting began, Trump also stated he is “open to the possibility of security guarantees” for Ukraine, though how that can be managed without membership in NATO — the multinational entity holding the line against Russian aggression — remains to be seen. At the beginning of the meeting, there was a palpable sigh of relief from European allies as the real-time decision was made for Trump and Putin to meet alongside their senior diplomats. This at least guaranteed that there’d be some level of note-taking, that American officials would have basic insight into the discussions and that the world would not be left to rely solely on the Russian spin of the events. The idea of Trump meeting Putin without those parameters in place wouldn’t have been a worry if Trump hadn’t had secret meetings with Putin in the past where no one else knows what really happened. After 20 minutes of speaking in Russian to the mostly American media, Putin, who speaks English well enough, closed out his time in Alaska by saying: “Next time, in Moscow.” Trump said Putin’s remark would get him “a little heat,” but that he “could see it possibly happening.” Putin naming Moscow as the site of a follow-up meeting is another way way of proclaiming that Russia is back in the great power game.

Article: As arms race in Asia intensifies, a-bomb survivors make final plea for peace toggle caption Anthony Kuhn/NPR HIROSHIMA, Japan — Shortly before the 80th anniversary of nuclear attack on Hiroshima early this month, several dozen elementary school students met with atomic bomb survivor and farmer Toshiyuki Mimaki to hear his experiences. He compares his experience to that of fellow hibakusha and former Hidankyo co-chair Sunao Tsuboi, who was 20 in 1945, and passed away in 2021 at the age of 96. A new arms race in East Asia The Norwegian Nobel Committee credits Nihon Hidankyo with helping to build a "nuclear taboo." That's the idea that nuclear weapons are so cruel and morally repulsive that nobody has used them for 80 years. toggle caption Per Ole Hagen/Getty Images But, by contrast, leaders of nuclear weapons states and self-described "realists" believe it is the deterrent power of nuclear weapons that has prevented their use. "There's going to be a hardening of these two camps, these two views of the world and their different understanding and value of nuclear deterrence," predicts Toby Dalton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Sponsor Message In January, Toshiyuki Mimaki met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and asked the government to attend a meeting of signatories to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), if not as a signatory, then as an observer. The international treaty, which would make it illegal to develop, possess or use nuclear weapons, has been signed and ratified by 73 states parties, none of which are nuclear weapons states. This puts Japan in the contradictory position of calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons, as the only country to have been attacked with them, even as it relies on the U.S. "So ultimately, while the moral authority of the hibakusha is really important," he says, "the change needs to come from within and between the states with nuclear weapons." Hidankyo's last stand Meanwhile, the average age of the hibakusha is now over 86. "I have proposed that we get all the surviving members in Japan together, and with all our remaining strength, surround the Parliament building to call for the abolition of nuclear weapons." Mimaki says he plans to make his move this fall, if he can get enough people together.

Article: Opinion: Remembering Ted Clark, great colleague - better friend toggle caption Doby Photography/NPR Ted Clark grew up around the world, as the child of a US diplomat, living in Holland, Morrocco, and South Africa. His steadiness, fairness, and decency often made me think when he was NPR's Diplomatic Correspondent that Ted could show some members of the foreign service what real diplomacy sounds like. Longtime correspondent Sylvia Poggioli said he was, "a masterful editor, gentle, patient soul, and steely defender of reporters against bureaucratic managers." Sponsor Message Editor Martha Wexler called Ted, "the gentlest soul at NPR, who nurtured reporters and helped them do their very best work." Reporter and editor Brenda Wilson said, "He had a way of accommodating those who didn't fit the mold of whatever establishment where he landed." Julie McCarthy, who covered so much of the world for NPR, recalled Ted Clark as "that rare creature who combined collaboration, kindness, and a steely determination to get it right— with a dollop of poetry thrown in." Ted and I came to NPR at about the same time, but I didn't know this story until this week: Producer Neenah Ellis and Ted went to Mozambique in 1990 to report on children who had been separated from their families during the civil war. The story Ted wrote about our trip was spare and matter of fact and kept returning to the children: how silent they were, how confused they seemed, how obedient they were." Their story, by the way, would win a Peabody Award. "When it was time to leave, Ted gave Manicu notebooks and pens and told him to study hard." "I'm so glad I got to go there with Ted," Neenah Ellis told us.

(They still dispute who won more games back then.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Among the 25 Nintendo characters that players could choose to control in the game, Naghmi picked Marth, thinking the swordsman from Nintendo’s tactical video game series Fire Emblem looked cool. Naghmi studied business information technology, but he spent more time studying “Melee.” He and his friends carried bulky CRT TVs, which GameCubes were meant to be played on, across campus. Advertisement Advertisement Before graduating in 2018, Naghmi made a proposition to his parents: Give me a year to build a career in “Melee.” Naghmi’s father, Hasan, and his five siblings immigrated to Maryland from Pakistan in 1972; Hasan delivered copies of The Washington Post as a teenager, then built a career in real estate. He sometimes wakes up from nightmares of losing in “Melee.” Most weekdays, he lifts weights, then plays video games, first for practice, then for fun while thousands of people watch him live.

Article: Wall Street economists are fixated on identifying tariff effects, yet stocks either celebrated or shrugged off three warm and sticky inflation readings this week, laboring to hold near record highs. The S & P 500 immediately processed a moderately elevated consumer price index report Tuesday as solidifying the chances for a September cut by the Fed into a still-steady economy, logging on that day slightly more than what would become a 0.9% gain for the week. Notably, over the next three days — through a hot but noisy producer price index reading and a messy University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey — the benchmark treated Tuesday's closing level just under 6,450 as a floor, testing it repeatedly and finishing the week right on it. As Bespoke Investment Group summed things up at week's end: "Price has trended steadily higher in a tight range over the last few months, representing rather sanguine action even though much of the news flow has been negative. Whatever negativity there is out there hasn't been nearly enough to interrupt the uptrend that's been in place since we made new highs in early summer." The latest push higher has not been terribly emphatic, or broadly inclusive, allowing skeptics to withhold style points from the rally. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the equal-weight S & P 500 tagged new highs this week before faltering a bit, a sign either of fatigue or late-summer indifference. Big rotations This week also saw some forced-seeming rotations, with the weakest laggards in the S & P 500 performing best and the Russell 2000 small-cap index making yet another lunge for its late-2021highs on all the anticipated-rate-cut energy. Neglected groups such as health care showed some life, the likes of Johnson & Johnson breaking higher from a long slumber, even before news of Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter purchase of UnitedHealth shares jolted that name higher on Friday. From a certain angle, it could appear odd that the bond market is simultaneously assigning more than an 80% chance of a Fed rate cut in six weeks when equities are at records, valuations are full, crypto is melting higher, credit spreads are drum-tight and buzzy IPOs are rocketing out of the gate. Registering nominal appreciation for these flush conditions while still asking for monetary-policy help, Wall Street, in the words of the old Elvis Costello song, has "a mouthful of 'Much obliged' and a handful of 'Gimme.'" This is less a contradiction than it is nuance. The jarring monthly payrolls miss of two weeks ago came after the Fed had last called the risks "balanced" between labor weakness and revived inflation, and the latest inflation upticks weren't enough to offset the job-market softness. Perhaps the market is conveying comfort with its own ability to hang tough even in the absence of a Fed move next month, casting a 25 basis-point reduction in short-term rates as a "Nice to have" rather than a "Need to get." More tangibly, earnings forecasts for the remainder of the year are on the rise again, albeit with the AI-propelled tech players the largest contributors. Historically, when the Fed resumes an easing campaign after a pause of at least six months (December was the last cut), stocks have responded well over subsequent months, based on this study by Ned Davis Research. Economists at Morgan Stanley argued Friday that Powell in the upcoming week's Jackson Hole symposium address is his last best chance to push against market pricing of a September cut, believing that "the Fed would prefer to retain optionality and, if anything, we look for Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole to be similar to the message from July." In other words, noncommittal and data dependent. If the 10-year Treasury yield were to rush lower in the face of reduced perceived chances of a rate cut next week, it could be taken as bonds declaring a high risk of a policy mistake, with the Fed behind the curve. One answer to those confused by the strength of the equity indexes in the face of still-elevated policy flux and potential stagflationary forces: Maybe markets are still burning off the last of the relief that burst forth after a worst-case scenario was priced in during the spring sell-off. Around the time that downturn was underway, I repeatedly noted the rich history of sharp, severe corrections that result from a sudden shock, stop just short of a 20% decline and are not associated with a recession.

Article: They fear that a stock market priced for perfection, with the S & P 500 currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is vulnerable to some sort of setback. "And when that happens, I think you'll see a selloff in markets, and that'll probably be concentrated in those areas that look most overvalued right now." "So, I think investors ought to be pretty cautious here, because what's going on is the market slowly getting more and more overvalued," Kelly said. Goldman Sachs pointed out this week that the top 20% of quality companies in the S & P 500 — those with massive cash piles and fortress balance sheets — are trading at a 57% price-to-earnings premium to the lowest quality stocks — a gap in the 94th percentile going back to 1995. AI superstar Nvidia alone now accounts for roughly 8% of the S & P 500, the biggest weighting of any individual stock in the cap weighted benchmark going back to 1981, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The stock is easily a key reason for the bull market, after rallying more than 36% this year, surging more than 170% in 2024, and soaring more than 200% in 2023. China, for example, is a key weak point for the stock, as any curbs on Nvidia's sales of its graphics processing units to Beijing will likely hurt the stock — and also the market. The top stocks look especially bloated when you consider this: While the S & P 500 has gained more than 10% in 2025, the median stock has only risen 3%, and remains 12% off its recent high, according to a note from Goldman Sachs this week. Eventually, Kelly expects some "violent" reaction — a sustained bear market of 20% or more — is overdue for the stock market, whether it comes within a week or in the next three years. Reversal beneficiaries This past week, Goldman Sachs identified some lower quality stocks with weak balance sheets that could benefit from a reversal trade, if macroeconomic conditions improve or if the Fed turns dovish.

Article: 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. On top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company. In 2023, the company was approached by Ingersoll Rand to be acquired at an estimated $25-$28 per share, a 20%-35% premium of the share price at the time, yet the board inexplicably rebuffed this approach. Enter Engine, who has announced an approximately 3% position in Avantor and is urging the board to focus the organization on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase its own stock. Engine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins. On the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. As a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities. When Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan.

Article: President Donald Trump has promised a "Peace Agreement" to end the war in Ukraine following his summit in Alaska with Russian president Vladimir Putin, dropping his demand for a ceasefire and sparking fears he is moving closer to Putin's position. But the shift in stance has sparked fears that Trump has adopted Putin’s position, as European leaders reiterated that borders cannot change through force and analysts warned of potentially disastrous consequences. “It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” An aerial view of a blaze in a residential area following a powerful explosion as emergency services respond to the aftermath of the fire, on Thursday, 2025 in Sloviansk, Ukraine. Kostiantyn Liberov / Getty Images Ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump told Zelenskyy and European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he was going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call. Later Saturday, Zelenskyy said, following a call with Trump, that “we must achieve a real and lasting peace, not just a pause between Russian invasions.” A joint statement from European leaders — including France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Finland, and Poland, as well as the presidents of the European Commission and European Council — did not directly acknowledge Trump’s reversal but said further talks must include Zelenskyy, and that “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.” While the substance of the Alaska summit remains unclear, Trump’s remarks have raised new questions about the direction of the peace process. “It does sound very much as though Putin’s arguments have prevailed over those of European leaders, who were insistent that a ceasefire had to be in place for negotiations to begin,” Keir Giles, a senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House told NBC News. “The danger lies in the possibility that Trump may also have become convinced that Russia’s demands on Ukraine are valid,” he added, calling such an outcome “disastrous, not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe.” Those Russian demands remain sweeping. “If the Russian demands haven’t changed, then it is difficult to see how there’s going to be a peace agreement." But not all observers see Trump’s shift as entirely negative. Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin adviser who heads Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, posted a clip on X Friday showing an encounter with a bear in Alaska that he hoped would provide good omens for the meeting.

Article: At the upcoming State Fair of Texas, confectioner Stephen El Gidi will offer up his own Dubai chocolate-inspired dessert — a base of rich Belgian chocolate and a pistachio spread layered like a sweet lasagna over cheesecake in a cup. From the West Coast to Middle America, dessert creators at state fairs are hawking their own confections based on Dubai chocolate, a milk chocolate shell filled with creamy pistachio, tahini and crispy kataifi, a Middle Eastern pastry. In May, product sales in the Confectionary category of Dubai Duty Free reached $20.2 million, up 81% thanks in part to Dubai chocolate, according to a press release from the company. There’s an element of luxury and craftsmanship to authentic Dubai chocolate, Hang added, noting a Dubai chocolate-covered strawberry confection would have only the finest, perfectly shaped strawberries dipped in high-quality Belgian or dark chocolate, paired with kataifi bits and pistachio cream from finely ground pistachios.

Article: TORONTO, ON — Air Canada suspended all operations as more than 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants went on strike early Saturday after a deadline to reach a deal passed, leaving travelers around the world stranded and scrambling during the peak summer travel season. A bitter contract fight between Canada’s largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline’s request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu met with both the airline and union on Friday night and urged them to work harder to them to reach a deal “once and for all." “It is unacceptable that such little progress has been made. “CUPE has engaged with the mediator to relay our willingness to continue bargaining — despite the fact that Air Canada has not countered our last two offers since Tuesday,” he said in a email. “We’re here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike.” Travelers are in limbo A complete shutdown will impact about 130,000 people a day, and some 25,000 Canadians a day may be stranded abroad. Now their $8,000 trip with nonrefundable lodging is on the line as they wait to hear from Air Canada about the fate of their Saturday night flight to Nice, France. How long the airline’s planes will be grounded remains to be seen, but Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr has said it could take up to a week to fully restart operations once a tentative deal is reached. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and cost more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets. Sides say they're far apart on pay Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

Article: Trump touts peace deal after leaving Alaska without ceasefire pact 2 hours ago Share Save Jake Lapham BBC News in Anchorage George Wright BBC News Share Save Watch: How the Trump-Putin summit unfolded in 82 seconds Donald Trump has said he would prefer a permanent peace agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war over a temporary ceasefire. Writing on Truth Social after leaving a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska without reaching any deal, the US president said that ceasefires "often times do not hold up". "It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a peace agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere ceasefire agreement, which often times do not hold up," he wrote. The Russian president, who is facing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, stepped off his jet and onto a red carpet to be warmly received by Trump. But despite the pageantry and public shows of geniality - as well as the Kremlin's earlier estimate that the meeting could last six or seven hours - Trump and Putin emerged less than three hours later with just a joint statement to the press. Handshakes and a shared limo: Our correspondents unpack Trump and Putin's greeting Putin said that, in order to make a "settlement lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict" in Ukraine. The phrasing indicated that Putin has not budged from his longstanding position that Ukraine should withdraw from four regions partially occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - and give up its efforts to join Nato.

Article: Asked during the interview aired on Tuesday if he felt connected to the “Greater Israel” vision, Netanyahu said: “Very much.” The “Greater Israel” concept supported by ultranationalist Israelis is understood to refer to an expansionist vision that lays claim to the occupied West Bank, Gaza, parts of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan. “These statements represent a grave disregard for, and a blatant and dangerous violation of, the rules of international law and the foundations of stable international relations,” said a joint statement by a coalition of 31 Arab and Islamic countries and the Arab League. The statement said the move is “a blatant violation of international law and a flagrant assault on the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to realise their independent, sovereign state on the lines of June 4, 1967, with Occupied Jerusalem as its capital”. The resolution backed an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – the UN’s top court – which found that Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. Last week, Israel’s Security Cabinet approved Netanyahu’s plan to fully occupy Gaza City, and in Tuesday’s interview, Netanyahu also revived calls to “allow” Palestinians to leave Gaza, telling i24NEWS: “We are not pushing them out, but we are allowing them to leave.” Campaigners said Netanyahu’s use of the word “leave” was a euphemism for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza – home to 2.1 million people, most of whom are refugees and their descendants from the 1948 Nakba when more than 700,000 Palestinians were forced to flee from what became the state of Israel. Past calls to resettle people from Gaza outside the war-battered territory, including from United States President Donald Trump, have sparked fears of forced displacement among Palestinians and condemnation from the international community. In their statement on Saturday, the Islamic countries reiterated their “rejection and condemnation of Israel’s crimes of aggression, genocide, and ethnic cleansing” in Gaza and highlighted the need for a ceasefire in the enclave while “ensuring unconditional access to humanitarian aid to halt the systematic starvation policy used by Israel as a weapon of genocide”. They also reaffirmed their “complete and absolute rejection of the displacement of the Palestinian people in any form and under any pretext” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to halt its aggression and fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip.

Article: As the Republican president pushes states to redraw their congressional districts to the GOP's advantage, Democrats have shown they are willing to go beyond words of outrage and use whatever power they do have to win. Democrats in the Texas Legislature started it off by delaying, for now, Republican efforts to expand the GOP majority in the state's delegation and help preserve party control of the U.S. "For everyone who's been asking, 'Where is the fight?' - well, here it is." There is no guarantee Democrats can prevent the Republican-powered redistricting, just as Democrats on Capitol Hill has not been able to stop Trump's moves. So far, progressive and establishment Democrats are aligned, uniting what has often been a fragmented opposition since Republicans led by Trump took control of the federal government with their election sweep in November. They can challenge his redistricting ploy with tangible moves as they also push back against the Republicans' tax and spending law and press the case that he is shredding American democracy. "We've been imploring Democrats where they have power on the state and local level to flex that power," said Maurice Mitchell, who leads the Working Families Party at the left flank of mainstream U.S. "There's been this overwrought talk about fighters and largely performative actions to suggest that they're in the fight." This time, he said, Democrats are "taking real risks in protecting all of our rights" against "an authoritarian president who only understands the fight." Pairing fiery talk with action Texas made sense for Republicans as the place to start a redistricting scuffle. Hochul dismissed Texas Republicans as "lawbreaking cowboys." Newsom's press office directed all-caps social media posts at Trump, mimicking his signature sign off: "THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER." U.S. Then, with Texas bravado, Romero reached further into history: "We're asking for help, maybe just as they did back in the days of the Alamo." 'Whatever it takes' A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 15% of Democrats' own voters described the party using words like "weak" or "apathetic." An additional 10% called it "ineffective" or "disorganized." Beto O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman who is raising money to support Texas Democrats, has encouraged Democratic-run statehouses to redraw districts now rather than wait for GOP states to act. The left "had its hair on fire" cheering those moments, O'Neill recalled, but were "left even more frustrated in the aftermath." Trump still secured tax cuts for the wealthy, accelerated deportations and cut safety net programs, just as some of his controversial nominees were confirmed over vocal Democratic opposition. "Now," O'Neill said, "there is some marriage of the rhetoric we've been seeing since Trump's inauguration with some actual action." O'Neill looked back wistfully to the decision by Senate Democrats not to eliminate the filibuster "when our side had the trifecta," so a simple majority could pass major legislation.

Article: Video shows prominent Palestinian prisoner for the first time in years toggle caption Bernat Armangue/AP TEL AVIV, Israel — The world got a glimpse of one of the most famous Palestinian prisoners in Israel on Friday, Marwan Barghouti, for the first time in years. He is pale, white haired, and shrunken — nearly unrecognizable from the dark, rotund man he once was, when he was a wildly popular politician tipped to be the next leader of the Palestinian Authority. Sponsor Message Now, he is serving five consecutive life sentences, after being convicted by an Israeli court in 2002 for helping plan attacks on civilians during a Palestinian uprising that came to be known as the Second Intifada. As of August 2025, there were around 10,700 Palestinians in Israeli custody — including several thousand held without trial — and, in many cases, also without charge, according to data provided by the Israel Prison Service to Israeli human rights group, Hamoked. Sponsor Message In recent prisoner exchanges of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners, Israel has refused to release Barghouti, whose conviction and long imprisonment are widely viewed among Palestinians as politically motivated. Officials close to ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel say Barghouti, who remains a unifying figure for many Palestinians, is the prisoner the group most wants released in hostage exchanges. "Marwan will be free and leading his people and I hope Ben-Gvir will be in prison," he said, referring to an arrest warrant reportedly prepared by the International Criminal Court for the Israeli minister. After the site was captured by Israel from Jordan in a 1967 war, the sensitive holy site was opened to both Muslim and Jewish visitors, but Jewish visitors are not allowed to pray there. Ben-Gvir's political party, the Jewish Power or Otzma Yehudit, has an anti-Arab platform which borrows ideology from two political parties associated with a radical, U.S.-born rabbi and which Israel has deemed terrorism organizations. Since Israel's war against Hamas began in 2023, Ben-Gvir, a settler himself, has focused on settling the Gaza Strip once again and has repeatedly called for Palestinians to be moved elsewhere to make room for Jewish settlements.

Article: Developing emotional endurance, or the ability to withstand stress or discomfort without letting negative emotions overtake you, can help that process feel less grueling and more like an opportunity to learn and grow, Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy tells CNBC Make It. "The more we understand that the frustration and struggle is actually a sign we're [learning], not a sign we're doing something wrong, it becomes a lot easier to tolerate," says Kennedy, a New York-based clinical psychologist and host of the "Good Inside" podcast. You can get to this state of understanding by following these three steps, she says: Keep a visual handy In a February Instagram Reel, Kennedy explained that learning happens between the space of knowing and not knowing something. The path between knowing and not knowing something is much more like a winding line than a straight and narrow one, Kennedy says — so when you feel frustrated, remind yourself that learning takes time. It just happens to be tricky.'" Engage in positive self-talk If you constantly tell yourself "this is too hard" or "I'm never going to get there," you start to believe it. I can take a breath and take a break and come back when I'm ready." Even if you don't believe what you're telling yourself, going through the motions — essentially, faking it until you make it — will help, because the practice will help you feel more confident over time, she says. Positive self-talk can improve your coping skills and build your mental strength, allowing you to put in more effort than you think you're capable of, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Sports Science and Management.

Article: 'The world is behaving irrationally' - Putin's warm welcome gets cold reaction in Ukraine 20 minutes ago Share Save Joel Gunter Reporting from Kyiv Share Save EPA Donald Trump welcomes Vladimir Putin to Alaska with a red carpet and a warm handshake Ukrainians went to bed on Friday night with the frightening possibility that Donald Trump could be seduced by Vladimir Putin into offering significant concessions on the war. For the Russian president, who has been shunned internationally since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the greeting marked the beginning of a remarkable return to the global diplomatic stage and set a tone that would continue throughout the day. "Red carpets and this level of ceremony are normal at international events, but in this case – for an aggressor responsible for the deaths of millions – it should not have happened," said Maria Drachova, 40, a lawyer in the capital Kyiv. "It should not have happened," said Maria Drachova of the warm welcome for Putin Putin's plane had been escorted into the airbase in Alaska by four American fighter jets and as he strolled down the red carpet, talking jovially with Trump, an American B-2 bomber flew overhead flanked by four more jets. Ukrainians who had stayed up late to watch the spectacle were seeing the "legitimisation of a war criminal at the highest level", said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian writer and political analyst. "This is a meeting that should have been conducted in a much more restrained way – minimalistic, without this level of respect." After the greetings, Trump and Putin sat down in front of a gaggle of reporters at Elmendorf Air Force Base, under a banner that read "Pursuing Peace". "When I saw what happened I felt crushed," said Serhii Orlyk, 50, from the eastern province of Donetsk, which has been largely seized by Russian forces and seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. But it was a very unpleasant spectacle – especially his smirks." Getty Images Putin gestures to reporters after being asked, "Will you you stop killing civilians?" The deference to Putin continued after the negotiations. "Trump has facilitated him arriving to be greeted as a head of state, when he ought to be finding it difficult to travel because he is an internationally wanted war criminal."

Article: EncroChat selfie led police straight to fugitive 1 hour ago Share Save Lauren Hirst BBC News, Manchester Share Save GMP Rothwell, who is making an offensive gesture with his hand, shared a picture of himself on EncroChat In the spring of 2020, international law enforcement agencies hacked into an encrypted phone network trusted by criminals around the world. It gave detectives access to private conversations between thousands of organised criminals oblivious to the fact that the supposedly uncrackable EncroChat system had been blown wide open for 74 days. "While he lapped up the Spanish sun, his associates carried out his orders and searched the streets of Warrington for those Rothwell had intended to harm," said Det Ch Insp Nick Henderson of Cheshire Police. "His actions brought chaos to the local community, leaving innocent members of the public fearful." GMP Images of various firearms were posted on EncroChat The messages revealed how Rothwell, now 38, was the catalyst behind a gangland hit where an innocent man was shot. On the evening of 24 April 2020, David Barnes, stepfather of Liam Byrne Jr, was shot in the leg on the doorstep of his home in Warrington by a gunman posing as a pizza delivery driver. He admitted conspiracy to supply firearms, conspiracy to possess ammunition and conspiracy to supply cocaine "I've give Leon a way out….he a grass…he turned on me for nothing," Rothwell said in messages on 5 April, just under two weeks before the shooting. "Tried kill me….while my daughter there…he my only enemy….when he lands in UK that's when it starts." Other communication revealed how Rothwell advertised and arranged for the purchase and storage of automatic firearms and live ammunition – most notably an AK-47 assault rifle as well as hordes of cocaine and ketamine. NCA Rothwell has been sentenced to 43 years after pleading guilty to drugs and firearms offences Det Sgt Colin Shackleton, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "The supply of Class A drugs in this investigation were on an industrial scale, with the criminal gang making eye-watering profits. "They believed they were above the law, and having access to their messages gave us real insight into their arrogant, egotistical, and apathetic nature." In the mistaken belief that EncroChat could not be infiltrated, Rothwell inadvertently sealed his own fate when he shared a photograph of himself posing in a mirror. The moment armed police arrested Jamie Rothwell in Barcelona In the middle of June 2020 a service-wide message went out to Encrochat users to alert them that their server had been compromised. In February 2025, Rothwell changed his plea, admitting conspiracies to possess firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life, conspiracies to supply cocaine and ketamine, and two counts of conspiracy to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent. Senior investigating officer Wayne Johns, from the National Crime Agency (NCA), said: "More than 2,200 criminals have been convicted under Operation Venetic, and Jamie Rothwell is one of the most dangerous. "Throughout the operation, the NCA and UK police have stopped 200 threats to life, seized over £84m in criminal funds and more than eight tonnes of Class A drugs, recovered 175 firearms and more than 3,500 rounds of ammunition."

One villa in Herculaneum covered at least 215,000 square feet — 10 times the size of the billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s home in today’s Southampton — and many were probably larger still. Just as the first four spots on New York magazine’s “Hamptons Status List” are occupied by a type of grass, a melon, a tree and a particular hue of egg, holidaying senators obsessed over oyster farming, fish ponds, imported cherry trees and fashionable moray eels.

Article: When Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney found out that their local drive-in theater was in danger of being sold to developers, they knew they had to preserve the beloved neighborhood hub — and a crucial piece of film history. Today, 91 years after it opened, Shankweiler's is still drawing crowds with new releases, community events and "the best popcorn in the Lehigh Valley," as McClanahan says in his preshow announcement. 'If not us, who else?' Shankweiler's has always had a special place in McClanahan's heart: "It was a very personal connection, because I grew up coming here, so I had that drive to preserve a piece of my own childhood," he says. The owners agreed to finance part of the down payment, and McClanahan and McChesney "scrounged up" the rest of the money from their personal savings, retirement accounts, and contributions from family and friends. "Because it's historic, because it's so special, there is that added pressure that we have to be successful with this." Lauren McChesney After the purchase, McChesney quit her job in health care to focus on reviving the theater. "But as soon as I made that shift, it all just fell into place and made sense to me." Just seven days after finalizing the purchase, McClanahan and McChesney re-opened Shankweiler's in November 2022. Making "just enough" to keep going While most drive-ins operate seasonally, Shankweiler's is open 7 days a week between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and Thursday through Sunday the rest of the year. Shankweiler's brought in around $300,000 in total revenue in 2023, and after covering all the theater's expenses, the couple paid themselves "just enough to put groceries on the table." The entrance to Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre. The theater is typically only profitable during the summer months, McClanahan says, and their summer revenue "carries the theater for the entire rest of the year." July is usually their most successful month, with a total income of $122,602 last year.

Article: Police seize £180k of Andrew Tate supercar deposit 21 minutes ago Share Save Georgina Barnes BBC News, South West Share Save EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Andrew Tate, pictured wearing sunglasses with his brother Tristan Tate behind, paid a deposit for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar A total of £180,000 has been seized by Devon and Cornwall Police from Andrew Tate over a deposit he placed on an Aston Martin supercar. The sum can be added to the £2.7m of funds seized from the brothers by the force in December 2024 after the same court ruled they failed to pay tax on £21m of revenue from online businesses. 'No tax paid' Sarah Clarke KC, on behalf of Devon and Cornwall Police, told the judge on Thursday that the funds used to pay the supercar deposit were the proceeds of tax and VAT evasion and money laundering. Det Supt Jon Bancroft, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "This latest judgement follows on from our applications made against the Tate brothers which resulted in a successful ruling in December 2024 and the forfeiture of nearly £2.7m of criminal funds. "People in Devon and Cornwall will benefit from the money seized and it will be reinvested to help prevent crime, aid victims and vulnerable people, and to boost good causes." He added the outcome showed how the police would continue to "relentlessly pursue all criminal funds without fear or favour".

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss an end to the more than three-year war in Ukraine, hours after Trump’s talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska ended without a concrete deal. “It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” Trump’s pitch for the peace agreement, analysts say, came after no deal was announced in the Alaska talks. Zelenskyy, who was publicly berated by Trump and his officials during his last Oval Office meeting, said, “I am grateful for the invitation.” The Ukrainian leader said he had a “long and substantive conversation with Trump”. “In my conversation with President Trump, I said that sanctions should be tightened if there is no trilateral meeting or if Russia evades an honest end to the war,” the Ukrainian leader said. “Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US,” he said on X following his call with the European leaders. Trilateral meeting In his first public comment after the Alaska talks, Zelenskyy said he supported Trump’s proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US, and Russia, adding that Kyiv is “ready for constructive cooperation”. But Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said on Russian state television on Saturday that a potential trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy has not been raised during the US-Russia discussions. Trump rolled out the red carpet on Friday for Putin, who was in the US for the first time in a decade, but he gave little concrete detail afterwards of what was discussed. Trump said in Alaska that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” after Putin claimed the two leaders had hammered out an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said Trump has been heavily criticised by the US media over the meeting in Alaska. “They are concerned about what has been described as far more of a conciliatory tone by Trump towards Putin, without coming out of that meeting with even a ceasefire,” he said. During an interview with Fox News Channel after the talks, Trump insisted that the onus going forward might be on Zelenskyy “to get it done,” but said there would also be some involvement from European nations. “Then they seek to provide security guarantees by deploying their own forces to make sure Russians will not violate the terms of that agreement,” our correspondent stressed, adding that European countries reject the notion of changing the borders by force.

Article: What to know as Air Canada grounds flights and attendants strike 13 minutes ago Share Save Lisa Lambert BBC News Share Save Reuters As Air Canada's flight attendants began their strike Saturday, the airline said it has "suspended all operations" while the labour dispute unfolds. The airline, which operates in 64 countries and has a fleet of 259 aircraft, warned that a "complete cessation of flying" would begin on Saturday, if the labour issues aren't resolved. The union said in a statement on Friday that it had requested that Hajdu not intervene and, instead, allow "the parties to reach a resolution through free and fair negotiations, without undue interference". Should Hajdu side with the company, she would ask Canada's Industrial Relations Board to impose binding arbitration in order to protect the economy, according to Reuters, which reported that the board typically agrees to such requests, but after it has studied them for a few days. The Board of Trade for the Toronto region has called for a government intervention , while the province of Newfoundland and Labrador released a statement describing the impact of a strike as "catastrophic" for the tourism industry during the summer season. When Air Canada pilots went on strike in September 1998 for 13 days, all of the carrier's more than 600 daily flights were grounded, stranding passengers and costing the airline C$133m ($96m; £71m) before a negotiated deal was reached.

Article: New Orleans mayor and bodyguard lover charged with fraud and corruption LaToya Cantrell (pictured) and her bodyguard have been accused of fraud and obstructing justice Neither Cantrell nor Mr Vappie have publicly commented on the allegations. From then until his retirement in June 2024, the pair are accused of claiming Mr Vappie was on duty when they were actually engaged in "personal activities", including during 14 separate domestic and international trips. While in New Orleans, they treated a city-owned apartment as their personal, shared residence and spent time there together while Mr Vappie claimed to be on duty and was being paid for his protection work, prosecutors allege. The two were also said to have taken personal trips - including to a vineyard in California to take part in a wine tasting - while Mr Vappie was on duty to "maximize their time together", at a cost of $70,000. US attorney Michael Simpson said their relationship did not constitute a crime, but reflected "a years-long fraud scheme that used public money for personal ends by exploiting their power and their authority", according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. At an undisclosed point in their relationship, a member of the public took photos of Cantrell and Mr Vappie dining together while the latter was said to be on duty. The two are also accused of intimidating subordinates, lying to FBI agents and committing perjury by making false statements to a grand jury - which decide whether charges should be brought in certain cases in the US.

Article: Trump's ceasefire pivot will have caused dismay in Kyiv and Europe 9 minutes ago Share Save Paul Adams BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Share Save Getty Images Zelensky and Trump will meet on Monday No deal in Alaska. But US President Donald Trump's pivot away from the need for an immediate ceasefire, which he said beforehand he wanted, will have caused profound dismay in Kyiv and around Europe. "It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine," he wrote on Truth Social, "is to go directly to a peace agreement." Ceasefires, he noted, "often times do not hold up". "If Putin's military objective was to avoid immediate constraints on Russian operations in Ukraine then he appears to have succeeded," says Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute. At their brief press appearance last night, Putin warned Ukraine and the Europeans not to "throw a wrench" in the works of the unspecified progress he and Trump had made. But that, for Kyiv and its allies, is precisely what Trump has done, undoing the achievements of what they all hoped was a successful preceding week of frantic diplomacy aimed at influencing the outcome in Alaska. A lot has happened since then, with Kyiv's European allies working assiduously to repair the damage and school Zelensky in the best ways of handling the capricious and volatile occupant of the White House. "The fire must cease both on the battlefield and in the sky, as well as against our port infrastructure." Reuters On his way to Alaska, Trump said he wouldn't be happy if he left without a ceasefire, but afterwards posted on social media that ceasefires "often times do not hold up" Europe's "Trump whisperers" picked up this morning where they left off last week. Getty Images European leaders held a virtual meeting with Trump on Wednesday ahead of the US president's meeting with Putin Despite Europe's emerging role as Ukraine's principal military, economic and political backer, everyone knows Ukraine's future security cannot really be assured without the substantive backing of the US. In her own comments on the Alaska summit, Italy's leader, Giorgia Meloni, said guarantees for Ukraine could be "inspired by Nato's Article 5" - the principle of collective defence signed on to by all Nato members. "If you can get that all done [a ceasefire and a peace agreement] in one go or in quick succession that's obviously a good thing," said a senior Downing Street source.

Article: BUNER, Pakistan (AP) — Flooding in a northwest Pakistani district has killed at least 220 people, officials said Saturday, as rescuers pulled 63 more bodies overnight from homes flattened by flash floods and landslides, with forecasts of more rain in the coming days. READ MORE: Flash floods triggered by torrential rains kill at least 176 people in India and Pakistan Hundreds of rescue workers are still searching for survivors in Buner, one of several places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where torrential rains and cloudbursts caused massive flooding on Friday, said Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency services. First responders have been trying to recover bodies from the worst-hit villages of Pir Baba and Malik Pura, where most of the fatalities were, said Kashif Qayyum, a deputy commissioner in Buner. At first, we thought it was a normal flash flood, but when tons of rocks came crashing down with the water, 60 to 70 houses were swept away in moments,” Khan told The Associated Press, adding that many bodies were left mutilated. “Our police station was washed away too and if we hadn’t climbed to higher ground, we would not have survived.” Pakistan’s Meteorological Department predicted torrential rains in the coming days and warned that monsoon activity was likely to intensify from Sunday onwards, including in the north and northwest. “It was not just the floodwater, it was a flood of boulders as well, which we saw for the first time in our lives,” said Sultan Syed, 45, who suffered a broken arm. Mohammad Khan, 53, said the floods “came so fast that many could not leave their homes.” Most victims died before reaching the hospital, said Mohammad Tariq, a doctor in Buner. “Many among the dead were children and men, while women were away in the hills collecting firewood and grazing cattle.” Pakistani leaders, including the prime minister and president, offered their condolences to the families of the dead and said they were praying for the speedy recovery of the injured. Pakistan has received higher-than-normal monsoon rainfall this year, which experts link to climate change, triggering floods and mudslides that have killed some 541 people since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Tourists trapped in flood-hit areas In India-controlled Kashmir, rescuers scoured the remote village of Chositi in the district of Kishtwar on Saturday, looking for dozens of missing people after it was hit by flash floods two days ago, killing 60 and injuring some 150, about 50 in critical condition.

Article: Immigration arrests dip in July, and activists hope they're partly responsible toggle caption Martin Kaste/NPR Immigration arrests dropped nationwide in July, slowing the pace of President Donald Trump's promised "mass deportation" just weeks after a sharp increase in June. "And when ICE is here, they're not out kidnapping people, right?" toggle caption Martin Kaste/NPR The protests have been going for more than two months, and sometimes just a few dozen people come out. She says one strategy, when they get word of an arrest, is to file a habeas corpus petition asking a court to review the legality of the detention, before ICE can transport someone to the nearest overnight detention center, across the state line in Tacoma, Wash. "If we are able to file a habeas petition in Oregon, we have gotten orders from the judge that the individual cannot be removed out of the state," Peña says. "Because ICE does not have any detention facilities [in Oregon], they are often let go." The fact that ICE doesn't have an overnight detention center in Oregon makes it harder to rack up arrest totals here —which lag behind neighboring states. "Sanctuary" states continue to get federal criticism Another factor complicating ICE's efforts is Oregon's long-standing "sanctuary" law, which limits the ability of local police and jails to hand over potential immigration law violators unless the federal agents have a warrant. "What I find so astounding by so many of these leaders in these sanctuary cities and in these sanctuary states is that they're willingly encouraging and protecting people who break our laws." In response to this kind of criticism, Isa Peña says she doesn't think the hotline system and legal aid is making it harder for ICE to do its job.

Article: TORONTO (AP) — Air Canada suspended operations as more than 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants went on strike early Saturday after a deadline to reach a deal passed, leaving travelers around the world stranded and scrambling during the peak summer travel season. READ MORE: Air Canada to begin cancelling flights ahead of possible flight attendant strike A bitter contract fight between Canada’s largest airline and the union representing 10,000 of its flight attendants escalated Friday as the union turned down the airline’s request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which would eliminate its right to strike and allow a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. She said there was an option for the travelers in line to go the United States, but they were told there wouldn’t be any further assistance once they landed in the U.S. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu met with both the airline and union late Friday and urged them to work harder to reach a deal “once and for all.” “It is unacceptable that such little progress has been made. Ian Lee, associate professor, Carleton University’s Sprott School of Business, said he expects the government to intervene within five days if the strike is not settled quickly, noting the government repeatedly does so in transportation strikes. But it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Laroche said he considered booking new flights with a different carrier, but he said most of them are nearly full and cost more than double the $3,000 they paid for their original tickets. Sides are far apart on pay Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans but we cannot work for free,” said Natasha Stea, a Air Canada flight attendant and local union president. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

Trump also proposed security guarantees for Ukraine inspired by the collective defense agreement between NATO member countries, which states that any attack on a member is an attack against all, according to Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister. Putin had again said that any end to the fighting must address the “root causes” of the war, which is Kremlin parlance for a range of issues that include the existence of Ukraine as a fully independent and sovereign nation aligned with the West. “I don’t see any changes.” Vadym Prystaiko, a former foreign affairs minister, said in a phone interview that the summit’s brief duration — it lasted just a few hours and broke up ahead of schedule — indicated limited progress toward peace. Genya Savilov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Tetiana Chamlai, a 66-year-old retiree in Kyiv, said the situation with the war would change only if Ukraine was given more military support, to push Russian forces back enough to force Moscow to the negotiating table. “I personally do not see any other way out.” But Vice President JD Vance made clear this past week that the United States was “done” funding Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion. Moscow’s forces recently broke through a section of the Ukrainian defenses in the eastern Donbas region, and although their advance has been halted, the swift infiltration has underscored the strain on Ukraine’s stretched lines.

Article: That woman — that woman’s numbers are — After the jobs numbers were revised down, President Trump, in a seeming fury, fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, replacing them with a more ideologically compliant, it seems, person. And so many commentators at the time, I myself said kind of the best thing, best case scenario for this economy at this moment is literally if the president does nothing, if he takes credit for the direction the economy is going, it is a strong and robust economy and one that and I’m sure we’ll get to talk about it, is about to get a productivity influx from AI. And so, obviously, it’s starting to reverberate in the economy and the Budget Lab at Yale that I run estimates that we’re going to see household prices increase by something like $2,000 a year. I cover this professionally, and I will say that I am a little confused on where the tariffs are at this exact second that they’ve gone up and down so many times. So effective tariff rate at the moment is around 18 percent where we were when President Trump took office was around 2.5 percent So that is a very substantial uptick. There is just not enough space in the margins of those importers and retailers to eat the cost of these tariffs without passing them down to consumers, whether they’re going to pass down 100 percent of the tariff or 70 percent of the tariff, or percent of the tariff. I actually think and this goes to something that I have struggled with as we have been analyzing these tariffs over the course of the last many months and even frankly, during the election, because during the election, remember, President Trump was proposing a version of what you’re describing, a high baseline, a high baseline tariff, but a relatively low baseline tariff, around 10 percent and a 60 percent China tariff. How do we measure success for this new ordering of global trade, if the point of the tariffs were that we need to reassess our relationship with China from a national security perspective, it’s incredibly important there are adversary. But the idea that the right way to effectuate relationships with our allies and our trading partners is by imposing really high tariff rates on them, in an attempt, I guess, to move us closer to autarky. So one thing that I think is being attempted here is not, I think, properly understood as economic at all, which is a restructuring of the way global trade works from the American perspective, away from fairly neutral rules governed in multilateral ways, and trade deals towards bilateral deals between America and other individual countries, or in the case of the EU, collections of countries in which we fully exert our leverage to get a better deal out of them than we would get from participating in the pre-existing global trading order. The thing that I’m bristling at is you’re describing the EU deal, and whether we’ve won or lost is if you look at what practically has happened as a result of let’s take that example in particular, effective tariff rates on imports from the EU were about 1.5 percent at the beginning of the Trump administration. But practically speaking, the idea that taking a tariff rate of 1.5 percent and turning it into a tariff rate of 15 percent plus is somehow a win for Americans. I’m just baffled by the concept, because no one would say that if you took the sales tax on certain goods and you increased it 15-fold, that was a win for Americans. And then it’s true, there’s these other provisions that are in the deal that the European Commission agreed to do a certain amount of arms purchases or oil purchases or investment. But if you look under the hood of all that stuff and it’s true vis a vis the Japan deal, also it’s true vis a vis all these deals, there’s not really much there. So there is a tariff on their goods which either gets paid, which means more money for the US Treasury, or there is an incentive for these things to be made in the United States, which is good for the United States. So a piece that I want to accept and somewhat credit the Trump administration for is if you think about how hard it has been to find ways to raise revenue in this country, and we can talk a lot about why that is. My problem with tariffs and why I think you have seen these other countries choose not to retaliate, is that tariffs are a bad tax and they’re a bad tax for two reasons. And I suspect that part of the uncertainty here is going to ultimately play out in the courts because these are far from settled questions, whether they even have the authority to do what they’re doing. Speaking as a law professor, has it been your recent experience that the Supreme Court seems unwilling to countenance arguments that we would have traditionally thought on the level of text are a stretch. I was struck that the Supreme Court decided in a case about removal that had nothing to do with the Federal Reserve, to be pretty explicit that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire the Fed Chair. The Supreme Court has the view that actually, the president can fire a lot of officials who previously served particular terms that have traditionally not been subject to political whims. You slightly get the feeling from that one that the Supreme Court wanted to give Trump what he wanted, but they also didn’t want to see in the long term, all their stock investments go to 0. All these cases are taking time to the Supreme Court, giving Trump the level of powers and grants of heretofore unknown authority, and particularly doing a fair amount of it through the shadow docket, is a little shocking. And I think what you are seeing is this court has a fair deal of respect for the rule of law, but also understands that it is in challenging times, and it’s kind of trying to pick spots and they’re picking they might not be picking the spots to the extent that you would like to see them, or other critics of the court would like to see them, but I am struck by the fact that they have picked some spots. That and by the way Warren Buffett for is one of the people who for a long time has been holding a lot of money in cash precisely because he thinks that the market is overvalued. And I optimist, hope that it does kind of great the way in the late 90s you got a ton of unexpected productivity growth that was really about computerization and a bit about the internet in ways that you couldn’t have predicted or anticipated years, a few years before. So one thing, that one way of thinking about it is that if AI pays off, the way it pays off is a massive forward leap deep in per worker productivity, a massive forward leap in per worker productivity where AI does something we’ve not really been able to do before and functionally simulates human workers like that. What I have experienced is and I’m sure you’ve experienced this too, is AI has fundamentally changed the nature of what it means to train for a job like mine, because it used to be that economics PhDs, they would spend a lot of time learning how to code and a lot of time learning how to debug their code. And so I have a lot of sympathy with your view that it kind of must be the case that as a result, progress or success here has to look like a kind of different workforce doing different things than it was before. It doesn’t displace them to give them a tool that debugs codes, any more than it displaced everyone to create calculators or laptops, laptops or Adobe Photoshop or all the different tools ATM. I always think about the ATM as an interesting example, because Obama always used to talk about the ATM, and then it turned out actually we had more bank tellers. We’re going to have 15 hour work weeks because there’s going to be all of this work that can be done ultimately in an automated way, by agents that are free. But I think it really tells us something about the job market and labor and how difficult actually like the words we use upskilling, retraining, apprenticeship, how hard all of that stuff is in practice. And in fact, the recession it causes is the time in which people in which companies begin trying to build AI into their firms at the ground level, replacing people, which is something we often see in recessions. And a little bit what you’re saying in I almost is you want a small crisis because the small crisis is going to give you the scope to actually weed out what is froth and bubble from what is real and Tenable, and actually figure out how to deploy a lot of this technology in ways that are ultimately going to be the future of the landscape. You got productivity growth of around 3 percent in an economy that for the prior decade had been closer to 1 percent So big productivity enhancement and that productivity enhancement was really about computerization. There is just the empirical evidence on this question, and it is vast, is that there is not a decrease in home wages that is associated with immigrants or immigration into this country, and that actually it’s you’re saying one version, which is, shouldn’t they be worried about I on these dimensions. In fact, by the way, a thing that I was just talking to someone at the Congressional Budget Office about this week, a bunch of the challenge in that we face right now as a country has to do with labor supply. And that is because of, again, our estimates at the Budget Lab suggest that is what you would expect in a world in which you have tariff rates that have gone up 7 or eight times relative to what they were in January. Unemployment is still just a tick above 4 percent but it is starting to show the signs of a labor market that is under some pressure from this trade policy. One of the things I thought was interesting in the jobs report is if you break the labor markets down by sectors, and as you mentioned, that the growth in labor was coming from really primarily health. Totally the way that the Bureau of Labor statistics collects data in real time about the labor market is it surveys about 1/3 of non-farm employers, and people submit, and it gives them a relatively short period of time to respond to that survey, because, again, it’s trying to be in live time. And in fact, over the last two decades, the Bureau of Labor statistics has gotten much more accurate with respect to its reporting in real time, which, again, is a hard thing to do about the state of hiring and firing in the American economy. The thing that I find really concerning about all of this, and this moment, is that the rest of the world sits with envy about how good government data collection is in the United States. One thing that people who understand this data better than I do tell me is that the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or the head of it, doesn’t actually have that much. How much do you take this as just like Donald Trump got mad at somebody, but it doesn’t really matter versus in a year we may not be able to trust the jobs numbers. I’ve also I’ve always made the point that BLS has about 2100 employees and one political appointee, and the political appointee is essentially the person who delivers the envelope with the numbers. In Argentina, there was a ton of pressure put on to report friendlier inflation and poverty estimates, and ultimately, investors realized that they were being duped and decided that for the longest time, would not actually make new international loans to Argentina because they couldn’t trust the data. There’s also another way that data can degrade, which is the Bureau of Labor statistics has seen fairly large attrition, 20 percent 20 percent This has been amidst Donald Trump and DOGE declaring war on the administrative state, and plenty of people not really wanting to work for them. And then you just imagine that Trump puts in charge, even if they can’t do all that much damage, just some right wing member of Congress who is primarily known for being a lickspittle to Donald Trump. Because the reputation of the Bureau of Labor Statistics would have degraded to the people who it needs to attract, which is very, very, very literal minded statisticians who believe very heavily that the integrity of data collection and data inference is like the highest good in an advanced democracy or an advanced society. And we’re chasing a lot of talent out the door in ways that are really going to redound and make some of the problems that have rightly been identified by this administration much worse Among things that depressed me about this episode. And I believe the Kevin who existed even during the Biden administration, if Joe Biden had done this, Kevin Hassett and others, frankly, in the Trump administration would have lost their minds correctly, correctly. And lots of the people in Congress, in the administration know it and won’t say it because of the rules of being a Republican in good standing are whatever Donald Trump does. I am of the view that it is impossible to defend these types of decisions, and I hope and feel confident, frankly, that if I were ever around them, that this would be the type of line that would mean that you no longer are going to be serving in an administration in this capacity. If you were so short termist that you are thinking tomorrow maybe you tell yourself like this chart looks cool or these numbers are good, but if no one believes it, and if in a year or two years you’ve denigrated the US economy a little bit, you have to ask yourself for what. Then there was maybe he will accuse him of a form of fraud related to the re habilitation and refurbishing of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters, which, as you can imagine, I’m sure Jerome Powell spends a lot of time thinking about. On substance, I think the Fed actually has a bit of a hard task ahead of it because they’re in a situation where we started in this conversation, the tariffs are the most inflationary policies of our lifetimes. And remember that the Fed just had a very significant bout of inflation, that it hadn’t even fully managed back down before this next round of inflationary policies kicked in. And until this jobs report, by the way, the Fed was operating with a fair bit of let’s wait and see with respect to the economy, because the labor market looked quite strong. They were looking at indicators that were suggesting that the economy was slowing down, and they were of the view that it was time for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. I will note their view was to cut rates by about 0.25 percent and the president has been calling for a decrease of around 2 percent which would be a lot, which would be a lot. So there’s a difference between the interest rate that the Federal Reserve sets, which is the interest rate that impacts how banks lend to one another and borrow from the Fed. And then there’s interest rates in the economy that you and I and others care about your mortgage rate or your student loan rate or your small business loan rate. They’re connected to each other because of a belief that when interest rates go down, the Fed there they are telling us a story about the direction the economy is going. But the thing that’s perverse about the idea of tomorrow we wake up and the Fed funds rate is 1 percent is if it was 1 percent what the world would understand is that interest rates over some relatively short, medium term, long term horizon are going to have to go way back up because we’re going to get a ton of inflation. And the result of that is going to be that you are actually not going to see translated into your mortgage rate or into your small business loan rate, anything like a 1 percent interest rate, even if magically the Fed turned on and said that’s what the interest rate should be. So there’s a perversity in all of this that even if the Federal Reserve did, in fact, what the president seems to be asking them to do, it wouldn’t actually deliver the type of economic benefit in any real horizon that would be meaningful to households. So Nixon had a Fed Chair named Arthur Burns, and he ahead of a presidential election, put a ton of pressure on Arthur Burns to get the rest of the FOMC to lower interest rates dramatically. So the Trump administration is doing something really dangerous, which is they’ve got a bunch of policies that are slowing down the economy and a bunch of policies that are pushing prices up in the economy. It’s putting a huge amount of money on the National Credit card, a bunch of tax cuts that you look around and the conditions are there for us to get into something that is pretty tricky to break. We have gotten ourselves from a economy that was rip roaring, just let it go, and inflation coming down to strongest, strongest economic recovery out of the pandemic to the S word adjacent by a set of policy choices that have been made that didn’t have to be made this way. And so I guess maybe that should make you a little hopeful, because in some sense, when markets have gotten shaky or the bond market with its disciplining device has gotten nervous, you’ve seen some pullback from those types of policies. I mean, maybe you can say the Trump administration has given itself a lot of tools to manage it because it could turn down the tariffs and that would be stimulus. But just from a fiscal perspective, and you’re also in a situation where let’s play out the scenario where it’s 2029 and these tariffs have been in place for a while, and for whatever set of reasons that have come, maybe the economy has absorbed them. And so I am very and one of the benefits of some progressive consumption tax version is you can imagine layering on a very small, by the way, carbon fee to that and rebating it and doing all the stuff. And frankly if you’re trying to have a social safety net that looks like other countries social safety nets, they have higher taxes on a much broader swath of the population than people making $400,000 or more. And they’re in the system and in the world in which we’re talking about 2029 and a new world order where we’ve had the tariffs in place for years, they have become a revenue source. They’re not as good would as an actual consumption tax, because they are going to raise prices for consumers more than they raise revenue for the United States, because they are going to also increase the price of domestic goods that aren’t hit with the tariffs. The way that you get from a tariff, though, to something that looks like in my dream, progressive consumption tax is you start to follow the playbook of Speaker Paul Ryan in 2017 when he proposed what. And the complaint at the time, there was a fair bit of support for it at the time among Republicans, the complaint was really the retailers in the US who said, wait, the Walmarts and the Home Depots, that you’re going to way increase the cost of goods to consumers by this new type of tax. And so I wonder whether you don’t manage to shift the tax base in the direction of a better designed consumption tax and better than the version I hope in 2017, because we managed to find a way to make it progressive. If a Democratic president came to you and said, Natasha, I just want to propose root and branch tax reform in a way that would be really good for the economy. And the interesting thing that I realized when I was in government, and I knew it before, but kind of got to see it on the ground in a meaningful way, is the IRS is a really important administrator of federal benefits. But because it runs through the tax code, in part because the IRS is quite good, despite having very few resources at administering things, you only really get the full value of the credit. And the third thing I would say, in this magic world, of being able to think seriously about tax reform from scratch, is that so much of the tax code has been distorted because there happened to be particular interests that are able to get an exemption here, or a carried interest loophole there for their particular pet type of income or type of benefit. And “Showdown at Gucci Gulch” is one of my all time favorites and a great read, and will leave you hopeful for the possibility of this type of reform effort. I also just recently had twins last year — I was telling you before — and so have been slow to be able to do that much reading for fun of recent. There’s a great book by Michael Lewis called “The Undoing Project” that’s about the relationship between Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, but also the ways in which the field evolved that I think is pretty profound and a great story.

Article: Once a month, most of the company's 14,000 employees pack into an underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory staff meeting, which some jokingly refer to as "work church." Executives go over company news and objectives. They also lead a grammar lesson, such as whether it's OK to end sentences with a preposition and when to use "who" or "whom." Epic's CEO is 82-year-old Judy Faulkner, who started the company in a Wisconsin basement in 1979 and has helmed the enterprise ever since. While Wonka is, of course, a fictional character, Gates for many years was the world's wealthiest person, thanks to his enormous stake in Microsoft , before donating his way to 14th on the Forbes billionaires list. "With half a million or so clinicians using Epic, there will be some who find it easy and some who find it difficult," an Epic spokesperson said in a statement. From Epic's early days, Faulkner has been averse to the idea of running a public company and what she's called the "tyranny of the quarter." She said she came to that view after researching public companies and reading shareholder comments. "Sometimes, there's a lot more than that." Without the benefit of public stock, Faulkner's wealth doesn't multiply at the same rate as that of her fellow tech founders and CEOs. Faulkner, who rarely grants interviews, agreed to sit down for a half-hour chat with CNBC at Epic's headquarters, where office buildings are themed, with many inspired by fiction, including "The Wizard of Oz," "Alice in Wonderland" and the Harry Potter stories. While she has yet to publicly disclose when she plans to step down from her role, Faulkner confirmed that she has a succession plan in place that ensures Epic will remain privately held and constructed firmly as she envisioned long after she's gone. "I think when I was a child that it was played in our house a lot, just on the radio, just on the record player." For further safekeeping, Faulkner established an oversight board called "The Trust Protector Committee," Epic said, consisting of three health-care leaders — all Epic users. Reflecting on her approach to leadership and decision-making, Faulkner said, "Just have the guts to do what you know is the right thing to do." CNBC spoke with two dozen Epic customers, former Epic employees, industry experts and people close to Faulkner for this article, some of whom asked not to be named in order to speak freely. Sometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter.' Judy Faulkner CEO of Epic Faulkner and her two siblings grew up in Erlton, New Jersey, now a part of Cherry Hill. Her mother, Del Greenfield, was a peace activist who was involved with the South Jersey Peace Center and the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, which shared in the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for its work in preventing nuclear war. "Sometimes when I do something that's tough, I think of my mother, who went to jail in her 80s for protesting at a nuclear arms site, and I think, 'I'm my mother's daughter,'" Faulkner said. Epic Systems Faulkner has publicly described herself as "the accidental CEO." She told CNBC she read books and took daylong or multiday courses to learn more about management, business and leadership. If you don't need it, don't buy it." At the company's Users Group Meeting last year, Faulkner took the stage dressed as a swan, with a plume of feathers in her hair. Faulkner has remained mum about who will be her eventual successor, other than to say that the person will have to be a software developer and a longtime Epic employee. Rana, who was a toddler when Faulkner founded Epic, has been participating in more high-profile speaking engagements of late, including representing the company during the opening panel at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Quality Conference in July. In 2015, she signed The Giving Pledge and agreed to donate 99% of her assets to charity, a decision that was inspired in part by a dinner she had with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett that year. Buffett created The Giving Pledge with Bill Gates and Gates' then wife, Melinda French Gates, in 2010, encouraging the world's richest people to give away the majority of their wealth. And when we went live, which is a pretty scary time, they were in full force here." Each health system that uses Epic has a point person called a "BFF," or "best friend forever," who is available to answer questions and help solve problems. "I don't know what so-and-so was doing prior to getting the call, but it's clear that when Judy calls, you drop what you're doing." Pete Durlach, corporate vice president for health and life sciences at Microsoft , said he's been in meetings with Epic staffers who have gotten these impromptu calls. I've got another meeting to go to,' but she really was not watching the clock." Graveyard of competitors Epic is used by all 20 of the top hospitals from the U.S. Epic said in response it would "vigorously defend itself against Particle's meritless claims." The second lawsuit was filed in May by CureIS Healthcare, a managed care services company that claims Epic has engaged in a "multi-prong scheme to destroy" CureIS' business. An Epic spokesperson told CNBC at the time of the filing that the company "believes in free and fair competition, and we also believe our customers are in the best position to choose the right solutions to meet their needs — whether with Epic or by adopting other products and services." Epic's competitors have also long accused the company of being territorial over its data and impeding efforts to share patient information between vendors. In a blog post last year, Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck wrote that "everyone in the industry understands that Epic's CEO Judy Faulkner is the single biggest obstacle to EHR interoperability." Interoperability, in this case, refers to the exchange of electronic health data from one health-care organization to another. Since health data is siloed, stored across dozens of formats and protected by federal laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, it's a complex undertaking. Over the years, startups such as Practice Fusion and DrChrono have tried to crack the EHR market with promises of greater openness and more user-friendly products, but they have never become more than niche offerings. Courtesy: Epic Systems Attention to detail One of Epic's biggest feats in its 46 years is managing to attract high-level tech talent far away from the nation's engineering and business hubs, especially given the harsh Midwestern winters in Wisconsin. Warner Thomas CEO of Sutter Health On Epic's grounds, a metal wizard stands in the courtyard of a castle, giant chocolate chips mark the entryway to a faux chocolate factory, and a hanging bridge leads to the company's very own treehouse. "So much of the success of an implementation was just a function of the politics of the hospital." Epic recruits the vast majority of its employees straight out of college, so its staff is relatively young.

Article: NEW YORK — Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter's stores. “For 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty — bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury — and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,” said Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer of Ulta Beauty, in a statement. Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Target, said in a statement he was committed to "offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target.” The partnership was announced in 2020 and came as the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping habits and more people tried to minimize potential exposure to the virus through one-stop shopping. “It’s a combination of two winning retailers that have great momentum in the market that can redefine the category,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told The Associated Press back in 2020. The announcement comes as Target is struggling to regain its footing with its shoppers who are pulling back on discretionary items and are shopping at other rivals that they believe to be lower price or offer better merchandise.

Article: Trump’s abrupt reversal, aligning himself with a position held by Russian President Vladimir Putin, came in a social media post on Saturday, hours after they concluded a summit in Alaska that produced no agreement to halt the fighting. WATCH: What Trump and Putin said – and didn’t say – after their meeting in Alaska After calls with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump posted that “it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” In a statement after the Trump call, the European leaders did not address whether a peace deal was preferable to a ceasefire, saying they “welcomed President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace.” Trump and Ukraine’s European allies had been calling for a ceasefire ahead of any negotiations. Trump’s statement that a peace agreement should be reached before a ceasefire appears to indicate Trump’s thinking is “shifting towards Putin,” an approach that would allow Moscow to keep fighting while negotiating, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. Trump, who also held calls with European leaders Saturday, confirmed the White House meeting and said that “if all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.” Trump rolled out the red carpet on Friday for Putin, who was in the U.S. On Saturday, he posted on social media that it “went very well.” Trump had warned ahead of the summit of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war. “We also discussed positive signals from the American side regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security.” READ MORE: Zelenskyy rejects Trump’s suggestion of ceding Ukrainian territory to end war with Russia He didn’t elaborate, but Zelenskyy previously has said that European partners put on hold a proposal to establish a foreign troop presence in Ukraine to deter Russian aggression because it lacked an American backstop. Trump puts onus on Zelenskyy and Europe Trump said in Alaska that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” after Putin claimed the two leaders had hammered out an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” During an interview with Fox News Channel before returning to Washington, Trump insisted the onus going forward might be on Zelenskyy “to get it done,” but said there would also be some involvement from European nations. In their statement after speaking to Trump, major European leaders said they were ready to work with Trump and Zelenskyy toward “a trilateral summit with European support.” The statement from French, German, Italian, British, Finnish, Polish and European Union said that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees” and welcomed U.S. “International borders must not be changed by force.” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said “the harsh reality is that Russia has no intention of ending this war anytime soon,” noting that Moscow launched new attacks on Ukraine even as the delegations met. “Vladimir Putin came to the Alaska summit with the principal goal of stalling any pressure on Russia to end the war,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. He said that “key issues can be discussed at the level of leaders, and a trilateral format is suitable for this.” But Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told Russian state television Saturday that a possible three-way meeting “has not been touched upon yet” in U.S.-Russia discussions. Zelenskyy wrote on X that he told Trump that “sanctions should be strengthened if there is no trilateral meeting or if Russia tries to evade an honest end to the war.“ READ MORE: Zelenskyy says Putin wants the rest of Ukraine’s Donetsk region as part of a ceasefire In apparent effort to bolster Zelenskyy’s hand before he meets Trump, France, the U.K. and Germany will co-host a video call Sunday afternoon of so-called “coalition of the willing” nations that could, in one way or another, help monitor and uphold any deal to end fighting, French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, praised the summit as a breakthrough in restoring high-level dialogue between Moscow and Washington, describing the talks as “calm, without ultimatums and threats.” Putin has “broken out of international isolation” and back on the world stage as one of two global leaders, and “wasn’t in the least challenged” by Trump, who also ignored an arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court, said Laurie Bristow, who was British ambassador to Russia from 2016 to 2020.

Article: Trump clapped as Putin made his way onto the red carpet for a handshake before Trump escorted him into his presidential limo as the Russian leader smiled like a Cheshire cat. The Russian leader sought to suggest in his remarks to the media that the talks were on his terms, bringing up Russia’s security concerns and praising his US counterpart for trying to “understand the history” of the conflict. He claimed two major diplomatic questions were raised: “the return of six Russian diplomatic properties that were de facto confiscated” during former US President Joe Biden’s administration and “the restoration of direct air traffic” between Russia and the US. Later, he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the European Union and Ukraine agreed with him that “the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement”. The meeting did not turn into a “new Munich”, where Trump would appease Putin just like the French and British leaders appeased Adolf Hitler in a meeting in the German city in 1938 by agreeing to a German takeover of part of Czechoslovakia. That said, for Putin, the summit was a tactical win because it broadcast to the world that the US president himself was casting off the pariah status the Kremlin had earned for its unilateral invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent war crimes it has overseen. The Russian president was treated like the leader of a “great power” – a status he has long been obsessed with returning Russia to – who had to be negotiated with, on his terms. Europe has moved to pick up more of the burden of funding since Trump was inaugurated for his second term, but its military capabilities and defence industry supply chains cannot replace those of the US anytime soon, even if they increase investments exponentially. Trump clearly likes his ego to be stroked, which is what Putin repeatedly did in his remarks to the media, echoing, for example, Trump’s claim that if he had been president in 2022, the war in Ukraine would not have happened. The US president cares more about the future of US energy exports, US competition with China, its challenge to US economic dominance and the exploitation of the Arctic than he does about Ukraine. It was Trump’s choice to host the meeting in Alaska, after all, and his obsession with Greenland – so seemingly strange to European allies of the US – makes far more sense in this context. Putin has also repeatedly sought to push Beijing to be more assertive in economic competition by calling on it to dump the dollar and push new trade and finance frameworks that exclude the US. If they fail to do so, while Alaska may have proven to be no “new Munich”, its legacy could be that of one of a “new Yalta” in which Europe’s future is to be shaped by new exclusive spheres of influence drawn by Moscow and Washington.

Article: In April 2025, the Human Rights Court in Kenya issued an unprecedented ruling that it has the jurisdiction to hear a case about harmful content on one of Meta’s platforms. The lawsuit was filed in 2022 by Abraham Meareg, the son of an Ethiopian academic who was murdered after he was doxxed and threatened on Facebook, Fisseha Tekle, an Ethiopian human rights activist, who was also doxxed and threatened on Facebook, and Katiba Institute, a Kenyan non-profit that defends constitutionalism. They maintain that Facebook’s algorithm design and its content moderation decisions made in Kenya resulted in harm done to two of the claimants, fuelled the conflict in Ethiopia and led to widespread human rights violations within and outside Kenya. The content in question falls outside the protected categories of speech under Article 33 of the Constitution of Kenya and includes propaganda for war, incitement to violence, hate speech and advocacy of hatred that constitutes ethnic incitement, vilification of others, incitement to cause harm and discrimination. Key to the Kenyan case is the question whether Meta, a US-based corporation, can financially benefit from unconstitutional content and whether there is a positive duty on the corporation to take down unconstitutional content that also violates its Community Standards. In affirming the Kenyan court’s jurisdiction in the case, the judge was emphatic that the Constitution of Kenya allows a Kenyan court to adjudicate over Meta’s acts or omissions regarding content posted on the Facebook platform that may impact the observance of human rights within and outside Kenya. Kenya’s Bill of Rights, for example, has as its sole mission to preserve the dignity of individuals and communities and to promote social justice and the realisation of the potential of all human beings. The supremacy of the Constitution also guarantees that, should there be safe harbour provisions in the laws of that country, they would not be a sufficient liability shield for platforms if their business decisions do not ultimately uphold human rights. That a case on algorithm amplification has passed the jurisdiction hearing stage in Kenya is a testament that human rights law and constitutionality offer an opportunity for those who have suffered harm as a result of social media content to seek redress. Up to this point, the idea that a social media platform can be held accountable for content on its platform has been dissuaded by the blanket immunity offered under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US, and to a lesser extent, the principle of non-liability in the European Union, with the necessary exceptions detailed in various laws. For example, Section 230 was one of the reasons a district judge in California cited in her ruling to dismiss a case filed by Myanmar refugees in a similar claim that Meta had failed to curb hate speech that fuelled the Rohingya genocide. The aspiration for platform accountability was further dampened by the US Supreme Court decision in Twitter v Taamneh, in which it ruled against plaintiffs who sought to establish that social media platforms carry responsibility for content posted on them. This is why a decision like the one by the Kenyan courts is a welcome development; it restores hope that victims of platform harm have an alternative route to recourse, one that refocuses human rights into the core of the discussion on platform accountability. Advertisement As the Kenyan cases cascade through the judicial process, there is cautious optimism that constitutional and human rights law that has taken root in African countries can offer a necessary reprieve for platform arrogance.

Article: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — In Kyiv, Ukrainians living under near daily Russian bombardment watched with astonishment as their country’s most important ally rolled out a red carpet in Alaska for the man they blame for over three years of war, bloodshed and loss. WATCH: What Trump and Putin said – and didn’t say – after their meeting in Alaska Trump also ignored the arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court that has kept him mostly confined at home or in nations that are strong allies. The red carpet treatment, the lack of concrete decisions for Ukraine and, most significantly, neglecting the significance of sanctions — a policy that could turn the tide in Kyiv’s favor — have felt like a betrayal for Ukrainians who have borne enormous suffering in the almost three-and-a-half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian servicemen, the country’s bravest and most skilled, have been killed and wounded, thousands of civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, and a fifth of the country is under occupation, severing families, properties and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time in a decade that Putin had stepped foot in the U.S., ending international isolation spurred by the 2022 Ukraine invasion; in other words, it was a win.

Article: Palestinians have no choice but to see their children die of malnutrition An Israeli air attack on the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza has killed a baby girl and her parents, Nasser Hospital officials have said, as Israel pushes its plan to escalate its offensive in Gaza. The attack comes days after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the military had been given the green light to “dismantle” what he described as two remaining Hamas strongholds: Gaza City in the north and al-Mawasi further to the south. Director Mohammed Abu Salmiya said the hospital was overcrowded with wounded patients amid relentless Israeli bombardments and doctors were performing an increasing number of amputations as they were unable to combat the infection of wounds. Director-General of Gaza’s Health Ministry Munir al-Bursh told Al Jazeera that 40,000 infants in the territory were suffering from severe malnutrition amid critical food shortages caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid into Gaza. Al Jazeera correspondent Hind Khoudary said the reality of hunger in Gaza was “devastating.” “Palestinians have no choice but to see their children die of malnutrition and starvation,” she said. “The latest to have died from hunger were siblings, aged 16 and 25, who died on the same day.” According to Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, “only 10 percent” of the daily food supplies needed are entering the territory, “while the health system is collapsing day by day and our capacity is very limited”. “Across the country, hundreds of citizen-led initiatives will pause daily life and join the most just and moral struggle: the struggle to bring all 50 hostages home,” it said in a statement.

Article: Tipped by many to make a swift return to the Championship, Regis Le Bris' team confounded the pre-season doom-mongers with a magnificent display against West Ham to start their first top-flight campaign since 2016-17 in style. After keeping Graham Potter's side at bay in the first half, the Black Cats found their claws in the second as headers from Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard gave them a comfortable two-goal cushion before Wilson Isidor put the icing on a flawless second-half display in added time. The final whistle sparked jubilant celebrations among the home supporters, who had gone nearly 13 years without seeing their team win a match in the opening two months of a top-flight season, since a 1-0 triumph over Wigan Athletic in September 2012. It's really nice when you can give back to them." Former England international - and Sunderland fan - Steph Houghton told Final Score: "This win means absolutely everything to the city and everybody associated with the club, especially when you consider the journey that we have been on.

Article: Trump shifts ceasefire stance and urges Ukraine to agree Russia peace deal 34 minutes ago Share Save Asya Robins BBC News Share Save Getty Images Donald Trump has said he wants to bypass a ceasefire in Ukraine to move directly to a permanent peace agreement after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a major shift of position, the US president said on Truth Social following Friday's summit that this would be "the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine", adding ceasefires often "do not hold up". Trump's comments indicate a dramatic shift in his position on how to end the war, having said only on Friday ahead of the summit that he wanted a ceasefire "rapidly". Ukraine's main demand has been a quick ceasefire before talks about a longer-term settlement, and Trump reportedly told European leaders beforehand that his goal for the summit was to obtain a ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, multiple news outlets reported on Saturday that Putin had presented an offer that involved Ukraine handing over complete control of its eastern Donetsk region, which is 70% occupied by Russia. The US president, who has previously said any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories", is said to have relayed the offer to Zelensky in a phone call following the summit. Just days ago, Ukraine's president ruled out ceding control of the Donbas region - made up the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk - saying it could be used as a springboard for future Russian attacks. The BBC's US partner CBS has reported, citing diplomatic sources, that European diplomats were concerned Trump may try to pressure Zelensky on Monday into agreeing to deal terms he and Putin may have discussed at the summit. Getty Images Ahead of Friday's summit, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hosted a virtual meeting with Zelensky, other European leaders and Trump Trump had previously threatened "very severe consequences" if Putin did not agree to end the war, last month setting a deadline for Moscow to reach a ceasefire or face tough new sanctions, including secondary tariffs. Meanwhile, the "coalition of the willing" - a group of countries that have pledged to strengthen support for Ukraine that includes the UK, France, and Germany - will hold a call on Sunday afternoon before Zelensky's visit to the White House on Monday. Getty Images Starmer hosted Zelensky at Downing Street ahead of the US-Russia summit in Alaska, with the pair agreeing there was "a powerful sense of unity and a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine"

Invincibles' dominance continued into the chase as Stephen Eskinazi was caught off Jason Behrendorff's first ball and Cox then produced one more special moment by clinging on to a spiralling catch running back from mid-on to dismiss Steve Smith for seven. Fire were bowled out for 143, making it the third-biggest defeat in The Hundred, although by hitting eight further sixes they ensured the match featured the most sixes in one match in the competition.

Article: GENEVA, Switzerland — Negotiations to reach a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world fell apart on Friday, with delegates in Switzerland adjourning with no immediate plans to resume. The final decision, or lack there of, underscored the influence of the United States and other oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, which opposed any limit on the productions of plastics, made mostly from fuels like oil and gas. Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said despite challenges, despite the disappointment, “we have to accept that significant progress was made.” This process won’t stop, she said, but it’s too soon to say how long it will take to get a treaty now. After a three-hour meeting, he banged a gavel made of recycled plastic bottle tops from a Nairobi landfill, one of many symbols of the plastic problem that were visible during the talks. A ‘deeply disappointing' outcome European Commissioner Jessika Roswall said the European Union and its member states had higher expectations for this meeting and while the draft falls short on their demands, it’s a good basis for another negotiating session. Red lines that were not surmountable The biggest issue of the talks has been whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse. New language had been added to say these levels exceeded current waste management capacities and are projected to increase further, “thereby necessitating a coordinated global response to halt and reverse such trends.” The objective of the treaty was revamped to state that the accord would be based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics.

Article: Beyond chow mein: How a new wave of restaurants is redefining Chinese food abroad 27 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Kelly Ng BBC News, Singapore Getty Images As Chinese restaurant chains boom, they are finding their way to new places Grilled fish on a generous bed of numbing chillis and peppercorns from China's south-western metropolis, Chongqing; cumin-laced lamb skewers from Xinjiang in the far north; and fiery rice noodles flavoured with snails from the famed rivers of Guangxi in the south. The trend is not surprising given that Chinese soft power seems to be on the rise – think viral Labubu dolls, humanoid robots and futuristic cities that are impressing travellers. From established chains to mom-and-pop stores and chic restaurants that challenge tired stereotypes, they have all been taking off here before leapfrogging further afield, to elsewhere in South East Asia and then across the world. Succeeding in Singapore is "a proof of concept for later expansion, convincing potential investors that the chain is ready to go global," says Thomas DuBois, a historian of modern China. And importantly, Singapore is a travel hub where, Mr Dubois says, eating is almost like a national pastime: "People go to Singapore to eat." And what they will find is menus that go beyond the ubiquitous dumplings and hot pot. Many of the visitors to Singapore are ethnic Chinese – not just from China, but from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Jakarta and so on – with a sophisticated understanding of Chinese cuisine. There is no one kind of fiery, says Claire Wang, the marketing manager for Nong Geng Ji, a chain from Hunan in central China, which is famous for its spicy dishes. It's quite the spread compared to the "Chinese food" much of the world has become used to, especially in the West – food cooked up by Chinese immigrants in the 19th and 20th Centuries, whose scrubby, nondescript restaurants were often seen as low-brow. Getty Images Many of these successful Chinese chains have their eye on New York City The food was simplified to suit local tastes, and that's how the US ended up with un-Chinese staples such as orange chicken and chop suey, and the UK with its chow mein and sweet-and-sour chicken balls. Then there is the stereotype, dubbed the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, a partly xenophobic myth that the food can make people feel sick because of supposedly high concentration of additives, particularly the flavouring agent MSG. When Thomas Tao was a student in New York in the 2010s, he says he rarely came across Chinese fine-dining, but Americans were very willing to pay for, say, Japanese sashimi. Sichuan Alley, which opened its first outlet in New York last year, is inspired by "alley culture" characteristic of early 20th Century Chengdu – a warren of old streets where people mingled and feasted.

Arsenal’s title frustrations are mounting, with fans questioning whether Arteta is the right man to end their drought after winning only the 2020 FA Cup since he took charge in December 2019. And, buoyed by a host of new signings worth more than 180 million pounds ($244 million) in total, Arteta is convinced they can finally get their hands on the Premier League silverware this season. When I’ve been taught, when I’ve been educated, that’s it.” Hampered by injuries to Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz at various stages last season, Arsenal lacked a cutting edge and were held to 14 draws compared with Liverpool’s nine. In an attempt to insulate Arsenal against another fitness-related collapse, Arteta has brought in Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi, Chelsea winger Noni Madueke and Brentford midfielder Christian Norgaard. After bemoaning Arsenal’s failure to sign Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins as Liverpool pulled away during the January window, the Spaniard is a far more upbeat figure on the eve of the new season. Instead of being reunited with Gyokeres, Amorim overhauled his attack with the signings of Leipzig’s Sesko, Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo and Wolves forward Matheus Cunha at a combined cost of more than 200 million pounds ($271m). Amorim’s team finished a dismal 15th in the top-flight, and squandered a chance to qualify for the Champions League with a toothless 1-0 defeat against fellow underachievers Tottenham in the Europa League final.

READ MORE: Pope Leo XIV thrills hundreds of thousands of young Catholics at Holy Year youth festival As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. “Even those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn’t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,” Hughes said. An effort to avoid polemics Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis’ pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City’s needs and turn it into the world’s first carbon-neutral state. He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century’s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a “doctor” of the church. Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself. READ MORE: Pope Leo and Trump are the most powerful Americans, but lead in different roles and realms Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo’s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month. Peter’s a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there. Given Francis’ stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church’s mission today: He said the church was “called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.” Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo. “He is the incarnation of the ‘unity of difference,’ because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,” said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese. “And I, as prior general, said ‘I understand, Your Eminence, but he’s got to do something else’ and so I transferred him somewhere else,” Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.

Article: VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico — Tourists slipped into borrowed red polyester vests from the Puerto Rico supermarket where Bad Bunny once worked, grinning as they posed for photographs in the superstar’s old uniform. "He always liked going to the parking lot to gather the shopping carts because it seemed that he felt free there and would sing,” said Delza Vélez, the head of HR at Econo, the supermarket. A father and son with the same name, Eddie Villanueva, traveled from Switzerland for a full Bad Bunny experience on a $5,000 budget, including $40 tickets for a tour of the star's hometown of Vega Baja. ‘No one can steal that’ Nearly three dozen hotels are participating in Bad Bunny packages, which include the concert and which have generated nearly $200 million, according to Discover Puerto Rico, an organization that promotes the island. G8, a nonprofit that helps impoverished communities in the capital of San Juan, launched a $25 guided bike tour called “I should have biked more” — a play on Bad Bunny’s newest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” which translates to “I should have taken more photos.” Another nonprofit, Acción Valerosa, partnered with the music group Los Pleneros de la Cresta, which plays at Bad Bunny’s concerts, to create the “Café con Ron” tour, named after one of his songs. A flag, a toad and a cash register Traditional tourism in Puerto Rico meant a hike at El Yunque tropical forest, a visit to Old San Juan and a splash at a nearby beach. The hotel — located next to a famous dock emblazoned with Puerto Rico’s flag that was featured in a Bad Bunny video — has seen 7% more customers this summer, Rodríguez said. Visitors have also asked him where they could see Puerto Rican crested toad, the island’s sole indigenous toad species that was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny’s newest album. I love seeing people’s eyes shine.” A full experience Vicky Galvez flew to San Juan from Las Vegas with two friends in early August, for the first round of concerts open to fans from outside the island. Wilson Santiago Burgos, founder of the travel platform, “Mochileando,” said he had doubted the government would hop on the Bad Bunny train because the artist has heavily criticized the island’s two main political parties. Bad Bunny tells people who come to see him: "This is the homeland that I love … I invite you to get to know it.” ___ Yamat reported from Las Vegas.

Article: Nerd glasses and friendship necklaces: Claire's was heaven until Shein came along Just now Share Save Grace Dean BBC News Share Save Matthew Chattle/Future Publishing via Getty Images Claire's has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland For Beth Searby, a Saturday as a teenager wasn't complete without going to Claire's with her friend. "You could go in with your bits of change that you had left from buying your McDonald's or your Burger King and you could pick up a pair of earrings or a necklace or a badge to put on your school bag and you'd be spending 50p, £1, £2." Beth Searby Beth's teenage years included weekly trips to Lincoln, where she'd invariably end up in Claire's Claire's has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after battling with falling sales and high competition. Originally a US brand, Claire's opened its first UK store in the mid-90s and quickly became a mainstay among tweens who flocked there for affordable hair ties, glittery butterfly clips, matching friendship necklaces and lip gloss. Its lucky dips bags - where you didn't know what you were getting - and multibuy offers like its five items for £10 deal turned shopping there into a treasure hunt and catered to tweens' budgets. Grace Dean/BBC Claire's sells matching friendship necklaces, for which the brand has become well known But many Claire's shoppers found that some point during their time at secondary school, the brand just stopped being cool. Grace Dean/BBC Claire's still offers deals, like buying three items and getting another three for free Al Thomann loved Claire's when they were younger because of its use of bright colours, glitter and floral designs. "Aspiring to be an adult meant rejecting that sort of childlike, colourful, rainbow, unicorn whimsy." How young people shop is changing Back in the 2000s and 2010s, young people bought things because they liked them, rather than because they were trendy, says Constance Richardson, who owns the personal styling business By Constance Rose. "They're still selling novelty products at a non-novelty price." Grace Dean/BBC Claire's has been trying to follow trends, but Georgia Wright says it can't keep up with the likes of Shein Another factor is that young people are often influenced by creators on social media who are much older than them - and don't shop at Claire's. "You've got 11 year olds with five-step skincare routines." At the other end of the spectrum to Shein, they're turning to more premium brands like Sephora, Space NK and Astrid and Miyu, she says.

Article: MELBOURNE, VIC — A senior lawyer in Australia has apologized to a judge for filing submissions in a murder case that included fake quotes and nonexistent case judgments generated by artificial intelligence. Defense lawyer Rishi Nathwani, who holds the prestigious legal title of King’s Counsel, took “full responsibility” for filing incorrect information in submissions in the case of a teenager charged with murder, according to court documents seen by The Associated Press on Friday. In a comparable case in the United States in 2023, a federal judge imposed $5,000 fines on two lawyers and a law firm after ChatGPT was blamed for their submission of fictitious legal research in an aviation injury claim. British High Court Justice Victoria Sharp warned in June that providing false material as if it were genuine could be considered contempt of court or, in the “most egregious cases,” perverting the course of justice, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Article: Trump posted a photo of me sitting by my tent - then a bulldozer arrived 40 minutes ago Share Save Jake Horton BBC Verify in Washington DC Share Save BBC President Donald Trump was riding along in his motorcade through Washington DC last Sunday on the way to his golf club when he saw something that clearly irked him - a homeless tent encampment on a patch of grass. "That is insane that he just leaned out the window and takes a picture of me and then posts it on social media in a negative way, using it as his political tool." On Monday, Trump announced his administration would be "removing homeless encampments from all over our parks, our beautiful, beautiful parks". We matched visual clues in the pictures of the tents - including a bend in the road alongside the grassy area where they were pitched - to a location on Google streetview. Watch: How Trump’s drive to his golf course shaped homeless crackdown in Washington DC The encampment was about a 10-minute drive from the White House, and less than that from the BBC office in Washington - so I headed down there to see what had happened to the site that had caught the president’s attention. "I've seen it coming through here three times." "You know, I understand he doesn't want to see mess, that's why we go out of our way to maintain it clean. We're not trying to disrespect the president or any other person who comes by." He told me he had been living at the site for years and works in construction, though he's been out of full-time employment since 2018. Mr Theodie says he doesn't feel safe sleeping in a shelter The homeless encampment was the largest in the city, according to the local authority - with 11 people living next to one of the main routes out of Washington DC. The latest data from the Community Partnership, an organisation that works to reduce homelessness, shows about 800 people are unsheltered, while about 4,300 others have some sort of temporary housing. The White House said it will offer to place people sleeping on the streets in homeless shelters and provide access to addiction or mental health services - but if they refuse, they will face fines or jail time. US Supreme Court allows cities to ban homeless camps Since leaving the site, Mr Theodie has spent three nights in a motel in Virginia after someone who saw the removal gave him money to cover it. "This room is jammed packed full of stuff, my tent and my belongings… but it's so good to sleep in a bed, to take a shower, to use a private bathroom, it feels absolutely amazing." Submitted photo Mr Theodie piled his tent and other belongings into a motel room following the encampment being closed Mr Theodie said he will try to find a new spot when he checks out of the motel: "My best option is to try to find a safe place to set my tent up. I don't know where that's going to be, but I would like to stay in DC." I also met George Morgan, a 65-year old from Washington DC, at the encampment.

Article: Once a place of horror, now a tourist town - with an uncertain future 3 hours ago Share Save Grace Livingstone Villa Baviera, Chile Share Save Grace Livingstone The village is in Chile but its architecture is Bavarian in style With sloping red-tiled roofs, trimmed lawns and a shop selling home-baked ginger biscuits, Villa Baviera looks like a quaint German-style village, nestled in the rolling hills of central Chile. Grace Livingstone Villa Baviera, formerly known as Colonia Dignidad, has a troubled and violent history After Gen Pinochet led a coup in 1973, opponents of his military regime were taken to Colonia Dignidad to be tortured in dark basements. Schäfer died in prison in 2010, but some of the German residents remained and have turned the former colony into a tourist destination, with a restaurant, hotel, cabins to rent and even a boating pond. Grace Livingstone The former potato warehouse in Villa Baviera was where political detainees were tortured during the Pinochet regime Luis Evangelista Aguayo was one of those who was forcibly "disappeared". Grace Livingstone Ana Aguayo's mother is now 96 years old and thinks she can hear her son calling out to her "My mother and father went to Colonia Dignidad but weren't allowed in," she said. My 96-year-old mother thinks she can hear him calling 'Mama, come and get me'." Mr Aguayo was one of 27 people from Parral believed to have been killed in Colonia Dignidad, according to an ongoing judicial investigation ordered by the Chilean government. The total number of people murdered here is not known, but there is evidence that this was the final destination of many opponents of the Pinochet regime, including Chilean congressman Carlos Lorca and several other Socialist Party leaders. It ought to be a place for remembrance, reflection and for educating future generations, so that it never happens again." But the government's expropriation plans have divided opinion in Villa Baviera, where fewer than 100 adults live. "From a young age, we had to work, cleaning the dishes for the whole community and collecting firewood." The government plans to expropriate 117 hectares of the 4,829-hectare site, including buildings where torture took place, and sites where victims' bodies were exhumed, then burnt and their ashes deposited. Ms Munch disagrees with the expropriation plans because they include the centre of the village, encompassing the residents' homes and shared businesses including a restaurant, hotel, bakery, butchers and a dairy. Perhaps people my age could re-locate, but for the older residents it would be devastating." Grace Livingstone Some of the houses in Villa Baviera are available for tourists to rent Erika Tymm arrived in Colonia Dignidad from Germany in 1962, aged two. "I want to be with people who understand what I went through." Chilean Minister for Justice and Human Rights Jaime Gajardo Falcón told the BBC that the government took the decision to expropriate the area in which the main buildings of the ex-colony are concentrated. "These were sites of political detention, of torture, surveillance and training of state agents to commit crimes against humanity." Grace Livingstone Erika Tymm, like many of the children in Colonia Dignidad, was separated from her parents The expropriation decree was published in July. Seventy-three residents and former residents of Villa Baviera have written to the Chilean president expressing their concern about the expropriation plans and asking to be involved in discussions about it. Grace Livingstone Georg Klaube is in favour of the memorial because 'so much cruelty happened here' Like many boys in Colonia Dignidad, he says he was given electric shocks, forced to take psychotropic drugs and was sexually abused by Schäfer. "Every night I was taken to a building, I was stripped naked, they would put a black towel on my face and electric shocks were applied, here, here, here," he says, pointing to his genitals, his throat, his feet and under his arms. I cannot believe there is now a restaurant in the place where so many children's tears, urine and blood flowed." Grace Livingstone The building which once housed the children's dormitory, where they were kept separate from their parents, is now a residence Mr Klaube is part of a legal action – supported by an association of former and current Colonia Dignidad inhabitants – which claims that the leaders of Villa Baviera are not sharing out the income of the former colony fairly. Among the other victims that support the expropriation plans are former political prisoners who were tortured in Colonia Dignidad, small farmers who were evicted from their land when the German colony was established and Chileans who lived locally and were sexually abused as children by Schäfer.

The State Department's policy shift comes after far right activist Laura Loomer wrote a series of posts on X criticising the visa programme and urging the Trump administration to "shut this abomination down." In subsequent posts on X Saturday, Loomer took credit for the shift and thanked Secretary of State Marco Rubio for temporarily halting the visas. The Palestinian Children's Relief Fund says it has evacuated 169 children from Gaza in 2024 as part of its treatment abroad programme, bringing them to the Middle East, Europe, South Africa, and the US for care.

Article: Derelict fortress transformed into £3m party island 1 hour ago Share Save Charlie Buckland BBC News Share Save Strutt & Parker The fortress did not even have running water when Mike Conner took it on Many dream of taking on a renovation project, something to transform and make your own. But for one former software company CEO, the opportunity to bring back to life a derelict 19th Century Napoleonic fort brought with it more challenges than he had ever anticipated. The building, which was known for its parties under a previous owner, had been empty for 17 years, taking him about a year to bring it to a habitable state. Now equipped with 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club, the historic building has come a long way from having no running water, and is back on the market for £3m. "I really didn't know what I was getting myself into." Layered with history, the 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks. By 2001 the building was bought by the Von Essen hotel group who intended to spend £4m to re-open the hotel, equipped with a cable car to allow access from the mainland. Mike Conner Mike Conner bought the island back in 2017 and has devoted years to bringing it back to life "There was no electric, no water, and any food or waste needed to come back off," he said. "My wife was pretty cross when I first said I bought it, she said she would stay once it had a flushing loo, which is pretty reasonable." But Mr Conner did not anticipate the first flush would require cutting through 16ft (5m) of rock to get to the biodigester pump, ultimately costing him £200k. Strutt & Parker Strutt & Parker The fortress now has 40 beds, four en-suite bathrooms and its own night club The 100-man fort was originally built in the 1850s to protect the busy port of Milford Haven from French naval attacks "Wales has got some absolutely fabulous historic buildings that are in really sad states," said Mr Conner. The whole Thorne Island renovation process took nearly five years to get over the line, with six men living on the island for about four years while work was ongoing. "You just couldn't predict how many people want to help you." The men working on the island would spend stints of about two weeks on the island, unable to shower and covered in dust. Mike Conner The island hosted its own festival for Mr Conner's 50th birthday, complete with a tight-rope performer Mr Conner, who trained as a design and technology teacher, said the design process excited him the most. He added: "A thousand men were working on it for two years, it was built in the same way as Stone Henge." "I felt my task was really modernising it," Mr Conner said, adding the renovation was a task of figuring out how the new would work with the old. "It almost feels like a tribute to their hard work and you're just really building the last little bit on top of what was already an awesome, bomb-proof construction." The island has "seen everything", according to Mr Conner, from 80-people parties to "millpond serenity". "People who come for a weekend are surprised when I hand them a bin liner and say it needs to come back off with them - but no-one comes here to collect the bins." Mike Conner The island, built in the 1850s, was intended to protect Pembrokeshire from French naval attacks As a former CEO, Mr Conner described his time on the island as "incredible" as he had to let go of everyday routines. It feels real time, it feels like living." Time stops on the island, Mr Conner said, adding that with something always going on, people tended to put their phones away. "I think that's what makes Thorne a special place, that people are present." Mike Conner Thorne Island operated as a hotel from 1947 to 1999, hosting weddings, hen and stag parties and birthdays Originally from Gloucestershire, Mr Conner does not live on the island but as the primary contractor spent a lot of time there during the renovation process. "It was quite cathartic for me to have this parallel life of complete chaos, which particularly through Covid was quite awesome." The project also lifted the lid on Mr Conner's personal heritage too, as it was not until he got the keys did he discover he is in fact a quarter Welsh, as his mum grew up at Upton Castle, Pembroke Dock.

Article: A family at war and accusations of poisoning leave tycoon's body in limbo for 12 years 3 hours ago Share Save Basillioh Rukanga BBC News in Nairobi Share Save Standard Newspaper Eleven months after his funeral in 2013, Harry Roy Veevers' body was exhumed and it has been in a mortuary ever since A Kenyan magistrate this week expressed the hope that a British property tycoon would finally "find rest in eternal peace", after his body had spent 11 years in a mortuary. In one hearing, the sisters, Hellen and Alexandra, were reprimanded by the magistrate for shouting out that a witness was lying and threatened with spending time in a cell, reports said. In another, Hellen Veevers emerged from the courthouse with a message she had written on her vest-top: "My daddy was not murdered." Despite the lengthy inquest into the death of the wealthy 64-year-old, the magistrate, David Odhiambo, found that the cause of death could not be determined "due to the level of [the body's] decomposition" after spending so long underground. "When you have a family split down the middle, how does the court say the remains should be released to the family, when both sides have been fighting since 2013?" said Francis Kinyua Kamundi, representing Mr Veevers' sons, Richard and Philip. Standard Newspaper Harry Roy Veevers' daughters have maintained that their father died of natural causes From the start of his detailed 95-page ruling, the magistrate acknowledged the deeply entrenched feud between the family members. Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters' reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body – including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said. In the magistrate's ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that "she did not see any marks on her father's body… and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth… She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didn't understand why they did not want to share the photos". Standard Newspaper The brothers, Richard (L) and Philip (R), were in court for some of the inquest that took place over a 10-year period According to the court documents, Richard Veevers "questioned why their father was being buried as a Muslim yet he was a Christian and he was told that if buried in an open cemetery, people would dig him up and steal gold from his body". The magistrate, Mr Odhiambo, noted that when it first began, he was just starting out his legal practice and would read about it in the newspapers, with "no idea that almost a decade later I would be presiding over the case". But the magistrate noted that this evidence had been called into question as samples had reached the UK four months after exhumation and they were not in the containers they had originally been packed in. He said a lot of things had happened soon after Mr Veevers' death, but it was not possible to determine whether the "acts of commission and omission" by different parties in the case could be tied to the cause of death. And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes. The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya. It was also a "tough" decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished "to exit the world in a certain way".

Article: Everything about “KPop Demon Hunters" is neither fish nor fowl: The movie’s leads, just like K-pop singers in real life, look neither Korean nor white nor indeed any other race; they look extraterrestrial. For example, one line from the song “Soda Pop,” performed by Saja Boys, goes like this: “Han-mok-um-eh, you hit the spot.” That first bit is Korean for “in just one gulp.” How odd that the songwriters felt the need to say that one phrase in Korean; han-mok-um-eh has the same number of syllables (four) and the same meaning as in just one gulp, so nothing is lost in scansion or translation. As an Asian who sings disturbingly white songs like Neil Diamond’s “Cherry, Cherry” at Asian karaoke; who speaks French with a German accent, German with a French accent, and Korean with an American accent, I feel seen. That gave us Apu on “The Simpsons.” To give one recent example, one of the running gags in the aughts-2010s hit “Community” was that an Asian American guy (played by Ken Jeong) was teaching Spanish.

Article: Tom Werner | Digitalvision | Getty Images When Astronomer ex-CEO Andy Byron and the company's HR head were caught cuddling on a jumbotron during a concert, the moral condemnation was followed by a collective question: Why would they risk their families and careers for a tryst? Always being 'good' Many of my clients who have engaged in extramarital affairs have always considered themselves to be "good." They listened to their parents, studied hard, landed a lucrative job, got married, had kids, and followed every societal expectation to the letter. Having poor boundaries People with weak boundaries often had parents who were somehow incapacitated — through addiction, poverty, feeling overwhelmed, or simple immaturity — and the role of providing emotional stability at home fell on their small shoulders. But eventually, they start to feel resentful of the people they are "helping." When an affair comes knocking, they rationalize it by telling themselves they have spent their entire lives giving to others, and now it is time to do something just for themselves. Being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage As renowned couples' therapist Esther Perel points out in her book "The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity," the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the relationship. They recently suffered a loss One of the first questions I ask clients who are contemplating an affair is whether they have recently lost someone or something close to them.

Writing in the Observer, Yvette Cooper said the group had claimed responsibility for incidents that saw those allegedly involved subsequently charged with a range of crimes, including violent disorder and aggravated burglary. More than 700 people have been arrested since the group was banned by the government on 5 July - including more than 500 at a demonstration in central London last week. The Met added that more prosecutions were expected in the coming weeks and that arrangements had been put in place "that will enable us to investigate and prosecute significant numbers each week if necessary". She also reiterated a comment made to the BBC earlier this week that some people who were supporting Palestine Action out of concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza were not aware of the true nature of the group. "No-one should allow desperate calls for peace in the Middle East to be derailed into a campaign to support one narrow group involved in violence here in the UK," Cooper said.

Article: Las Vegas is experiencing a tourism slump, which experts attribute to larger American trends of a slowing economy and a decline in foreign travelers: Visitor numbers overall were 11% lower in June compared to the year before, after declining for six months straight on a year-to-year basis, per the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. What happens in Vegas…has roots outside of Vegas The vacant slot machines at Caesars Palace could be indicative of how Americans feel about their wallets, since it takes financial chutzpah to gamble. Experts say that economic anxieties are making Americans more guarded in their leisure spending, as evidenced by how they scaled back on their vacation budgets this spring, according to a recent Deloitte survey. Rising labor costs and fewer gambling enticements like bargain steak tips may have diminished the bang for the buck of the entertainment mecca, prompting some to consider destinations without daily $50 resort fees and more hiking instead. Plus, foreigners foregoing stateside travel is hitting Las Vegas harder than other places as it is the fifth most popular destination for foreign visitors to the US: The number of international tourists visiting Sin City declined 13% in June from a year ago—part of a nationwide trend that industry experts attribute to tightening border control and frustration with American politics. Canadians, who make up the largest group of foreign visitors to Vegas, have cooled on trips south of the border after President Trump imposed steep tariffs on the nation and referred to it as the 51st US state. Some Americans might just be postponing their Vegas vacations in anticipation of major events soon to be hosted by the city, including the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix in November, the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and concerts by Paul McCartney and the Backstreet Boys, casino industry consultant Oliver Lovat told NPR.—SK

No tips, no taxes The tourism slowdown stings even more since some service workers had hoped to cash in on a new federal policy from the GOP’s recently passed tax law that allows them to exempt up to $25,000 in tips from income taxes. But “no taxes on tips” assumes there are tips, which have been drying up in the desert: A tattoo artist in downtown Vegas told the Wall Street Journal last month that his monthly tip income recently dropped from $3,000–$6,000 down to $1,500. It’s an especially cruel hand for Vegas to draw, since President Trump has said the “no taxes on tips” policy was inspired by a waitress who works in the city. Tax return: Service employees may not have time to wait for tourism to pick up again to take advantage of “no taxes on tips.” The policy is slated to sunset after 2028, though experts say it could prove popular enough for Congress to extend it.—BC

The letter did not specifically name Ukraine, which Putin's forces invaded in 2022, but beseeched him to think of children and “an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.” Nor did the American first lady discuss the fighting other than to say to Putin that he could “singlehandedly restore” the “melodic laughter” of children who have been caught in the conflict. The Associated Press documented the grabbing of Ukrainian children in 2022, after which the International Criminal Court said it had issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.

Article: We spoke to Nancy Meck, a professional organizer and owner of Meck Organizing, who said that you have a much better chance of wearing — and appreciating — your shoes when you can easily reach them. In order to find the best shoe rack options to consider to help you get the most use from your current shoes, we consulted Meck, as well as Caroline Solomon, founder of home organizing business Caroline Solomon Home, and Kelly McGreevy, founder of home organization business Styled Neatly, for their shoe rack, shelf and organizing recommendations. Here’s everything our experts recommended we keep in mind when making this list: Dimensions : Since shoe racks are available in many different sizes, heights and widths, we made sure to include options on this list with several different sizes, especially since how much room you have in your home will determine which ones are best for you. : Since shoe racks are available in many different sizes, heights and widths, we made sure to include options on this list with several different sizes, especially since how much room you have in your home will determine which ones are best for you. Style: We made sure to include shoe storage options that are made of different materials like wood and metal, and ones that are mostly made up of shelving without any type of door. | Capacity: 9 pairs What we like Made of metal Stackable Holds 30 pounds Something to note Doesn't hold all heels This durable metal shoe rack has three shelves, though you can stack multiple ones on top of each other to store more shoes. | Capacity: 12 pairs What we like Fast setup Easy to see all shoes at once Lightweight Something to note Doesn't hold boots An over-the-door shoe holder is a go-to option for storing shoes, especially when you have an extremely small room, since they allow you to have more surface area on your floor for furniture. | Capacity: 18 pairs What we like It's tall You can use it for books too It's under $100 Something to note The shoes are exposed While it may seem unconventional to use a bookcase for a shoe rack, Solomon said the Billy Bookcase from Ikea is one of her favorite “no-nonsense” ways to store her heels and show them off for visitors. | Capacity: 6 to 8 pairs What we like Fast setup Stackable Lightweight Something to note Only holds 6 to 8 pairs Meck prefers a classic shoe shelf: She feels it’s a no-fuss fix for lining up shoes easily, efficiently and neatly. It’s made from bamboo, which the brand says “is easily renewable, so it’s an environmentally friendly material.” It has two shelves that can typically hold around eight pairs of women’s shoes or six pairs of men’s shoes, according to The Container Store. McGreevy said this Large Drop-Front Shoe Box Case from The Container Store made “organization a breeze.” Part of the appeal of a box like this one is that you can keep your shoes safe from external forces while also letting you see them. (And if this particular profile or aesthetic doesn’t fit your closet, The Container Store has lots of other options, too: check out its Tall Side Profile Drop-Front Shoe Box and the Cambridge Drop-Front Shoe Box in Linen. Meck mentioned this 15-Unit Stackable Organizer from ClosetMaid for those who want cubbies, which can be great if you want order and division between pairs of shoes (or single shoes). Organize your shoesBefore buying any kind of shoe storage, McGreevy encourages a shoe cleanse: Categorize all of your shoes first and then place them side-by-side and decide whether to hold on to them, donate them or throw them away. Here are a few other expert-recommended tips to consider when arranging your shoe storage: Boots: Both McGreevy and Solomon suggested using shapers in order to help maintain their shape and keep them standing straight. For seasonal shoes like winter and rain boots, Solomon recommends the best place for storage is in an entryway closet or mudroom, especially if you don’t want to drag in dirt from outside. Solomon recommended avoiding shoe racks with slats, as they “always lead to heels getting stuck in between the rungs,” or slanted shelves, as shoes tend to fall off the racks more easily.” At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Martino, who runs the eatery’s Facebook page — where a message posted Saturday announced Tana’s death — said that Perencevic was close with the former proprietor and had been with him in Belgrade on Friday. Advertisement “Dan lived a wonderful life, and we will keep Dan Tana’s in his memory forever,” Perencevic said in a statement relayed by Martino, who was at the restaurant on Saturday night. While seeking acting jobs, the trade publication reported, Tana started as a dishwasher at the Villa Capri restaurant in Hollywood, before eventually becoming the maitre d’ at La Scala in Beverly Hills. (Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times) It eventually gained a following after actor Richard Burton, a seven-time Academy Award nominee who married Taylor the year the restaurant opened, became a regular presence. George Clooney, former Lakers owner Jerry Buss and heiress Nicky Hilton are among the eclectic bunch of notables with menu items named for them, and the routine presence of celebrities has only burnished the eatery’s aura — especially among tourists hoping for a table. In 2016, Times restaurant critic Jonathan Gold penned a memorable review of Dan Tana’s, relating the time he took a high school crush there on a date, only to embarrass himself: “The waiter laughed when I tried to order wine, and then served us Sprite in wine glasses. She groaned and pulled out the credit card her parents had given her for emergencies.” As for the food, Gold called some of it “ordinary,” but noted, “Weirdly enough, I don’t care,” noting the restaurant’s place in L.A.’s culinary firmament. He went on to highlight dishes including the chicken parm, and instructed readers, “Dan Tana’s is not about denying yourself things.” Dan Tana’s on Santa Monica Boulevard is known for dishes including chicken Parmesan. The staff has been the same: you could leave L.A., come back after five years and come in and they will remember your favorite drink.” Martino sent The Times a video of an impromptu toast she made in Tana’s honor at the restaurant on Saturday night.

Article: Increasing access to new Chinese-made medications could give Americans more options for cheaper drugs and treatments for a whole range of diseases on the rise, including diabetes, cancer and heart disease. That same competition might also spur companies on both sides of the Pacific (and elsewhere) to invest more in the development of innovative medicines that chip away at rates of diabetes, heart disease, dementia and cancer to lengthen people’s lives — or perhaps further link up on collaborative efforts. For many of the approximately 500 million Chinese who live in rural communities (around 35 percent of the population), doctors and health care services are unreliable or difficult to reach — just drink hot water for what ails you, the folk wisdom goes. Though China can manufacture and distribute drugs at heightened speeds — sometimes in as little as 16 months — it still has trouble with frontier science for developing new drugs. Yi Rao, a neurobiologist at Peking University, told me that China had yet to build a federal apparatus to support the life sciences that was capable of rivaling America’s National Institutes of Health.

As The Journal put it, presumably channeling the anxieties of one of the paper’s frustrated editors: “As they enter what is usually the prime, C-suite career stage, more businesses are retaining their aging leaders or skipping a generation in search of the next ones.” I was born in 1976, and my reaction to this news was, in Gen X parlance, whatever, man. The disappointment some X-ers feel about this is indicative of an inherent contradiction: They did not trust institutions, empty ambitions and rampant consumerism when they were young, but still feel let down when, as middle-aged adults, the system has not delivered the professional success and extreme run-up of home equity that boomers have accrued. The Canadian writer Douglas Coupland, who popularized the term “Generation X” with his 1991 novel of that name, had a character in it named Dag, who puts it thus: “I don’t know … whether I feel more that I want to punish some aging crock for frittering away my world or whether I’m just upset that the world has gotten too big — way beyond our capacity to tell stories about it, and so all we’re stuck with are those blips and chunks and snippets on bumpers.” Mr.

Soon after, according to the San Bernardino Police Department, a man — who has not been identified — contacted the dispatch center, saying that masked men had tried to pull him over, broke his car window and shot at him. Advertisement In a statement Saturday night, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said agents had been conducting a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino and said that “Customs and Border Protection] officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down.” “In the course of the incident the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the statement read. Because of that, the official said, a CBP officer discharged his firearm “in self-defense.” According to a news release from the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, federal agents broke the driver and passenger windows of the vehicle and fired three times. “Firing at civilians, harassing families without cause, and targeting community voices must stop.” Advertisement According to the San Bernardino Police Department, officers later located the vehicle in the 1000 block of Mt. “Under the California Values Act, California law enforcement agencies are prohibited from assisting federal officials with immigration enforcement, so our officers left the scene as the investigation was being conducted by federal authorities,” police said in a news release. In a statement, a DHS spokesperson misidentified the police department, describing it as the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, and said local authorities had the man in custody but then set him free. The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice said in a news release that the agents didn’t present a warrant and remained outside the home until 3:45 p.m., “pressuring the individual to come outside.” Advertisement The group added that two community members “were detained using unnecessary force, including one for speaking out.” “Federal agents requested assistance during a lawful arrest for assaulting a federal officer when a crowd created a potential officer safety concern,” the police department said in a statement.

Luxury designers have been soft-sponsoring celebrity weddings for years, and fast-food chains have been riding the nuptial promo wave ever since Burger King paid for a conveniently named couple’s Illinois wedding ten years ago. Now, the post-pandemic wedding boom and Vegas’s quest to uphold its “Wedding Capital of the World” title have built an empire of kitschy, consumer brand-sponsored weddings: Taco Bell announced that for Valentine’s Day this year, you could get married in its Las Vegas chapel with a bouquet of hot sauces for just $777…a $177 increase from when the company first announced the package in 2017.

Article: Amorim could be excused for thinking someone is having a cruel joke at his expense when he assesses an opening that starts with Arsenal at Old Trafford, includes a trip to Manchester City and home game with Chelsea in United's first five games, and then Liverpool at Anfield in match eight on 18 October. United, led by chief executive Omar Berrada, went for an imaginative choice rather than the safe options - which included Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Graham Potter - suggested by then sporting director Dan Ashworth as Ten Hag's replacement. The immediate collateral damage in shaping a United squad to fit that system was the discarding of five players - four of whom are senior internationals who prefer to play wide. The full extent of the additional impact Amorim has made by bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, at a combined cost in the region of £200m, to fill the attacking roles remains to be seen. At the back, team selections in five unbeaten games in three countries across pre-season, suggest Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are battling for a single slot as the middle defender, while Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, when fit, are vying to be first choice on the left of the three. In theory, it also provides support in midfield, which tended to be completely overrun during Ten Hag's time because the Dutchman wanted to stretch the space in that area of the field, something Casemiro was not able to do, while none of those asked to partner him made a particular success of either. The 33-year-old does not have limitless energy but he was preferred to Christian Eriksen, who was about to leave the club, and, more significantly, Manuel Ugarte, who cost £50.8m to sign from PSG less than 12 months ago, for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May, which United lost. More importantly, a financial outlook provided for the club by an external agency spoke about delivering a place in the Europa League at the end of this season as a stepping stone to a return to the Champions League in 2027-28.

Article: Billed as a battle between the undefeated UFC middleweights, Du Plessis put his belt on the line for the third time on Saturday against Chimaev, the No 3-ranked contender and considered one of the most feared pound-for-pound fighters on the UFC roster. But Chimaev was in control of the bout from the beginning until the end in one of the most one-sided title fights in UFC history; all three judges scored the bout 50-44 for the Chechen fighter, who holds dual Russian and United Arab Emirates citizenship. Chimaev, who first entered UFC in 2020 and has previously defeated former champions Kamaru Usman and Robert Whittaker, was rarely threatened against Du Plessis, and despite being denied a finish by the South African he relentlessly took down the defending champion in the opening minute of every round. Advertisement Du Plessis’s only moment to stage a come-from-behind victory came in the final round when he spun his way on top of his tiring opponent and executed a guillotine. Unfortunately for the reigning champion, the choke only lasted a couple of seconds as Chimaev methodically fought his way out and again resumed his control of the fight until the final bell.

Article: Three Republican-led states to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington toggle caption Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP WASHINGTON — Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention. The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. National Guard members are coming from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio The Republican governors of the three states said they were sending hundreds of troops at the request of the Trump administration. Patrick Morrisey said he directed 300 to 400 Guard troops to head to Washington, adding that the state "is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital." South Carolina Gov. Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police from the Guard to "carry out presence patrols and serve as added security" and that they were expected to arrive in the coming days. toggle caption Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP The activations suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers. Sponsor Message Protest pushes back on federal crackdown in Washington A protest against Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, "No fascist takeover of D.C.," and some in the crowd held signs saying, "No military occupation." Morgan Taylor, one of the protest organizers, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump's actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda. "I can't believe that this is happening in this country at this time." Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreaching and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. "Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities," Finnigan said. Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was "very uncomfortable and worried" for the safety or her students given the "unmarked officers of all types" now roaming Washington and detaining people. Dickstein said she turned out to the protest with friends and relatives to "prevent a continuous domino effect going forward with other cities." Surge of federal law enforcement in Washington draws mixed reactions Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. Sponsor Message City leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with Trump's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration, though they have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover. On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an "emergency police commissioner" after the district's top lawyer sued. City officials say they are evaluating how to best comply In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the "city government's failure to maintain public order." He said that impeded the "federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence." In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that "our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now." She added that if Washington residents stick together, "we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don't have full access to it."

Article: British horse racing will go on strike on 10 September, taking the unprecedented action of refusing to race in protest against the Government's proposed tax rise on betting on the sport. As part of its industry-wide Axe The Racing Tax campaign, four fixtures scheduled for that day at Lingfield Park, Carlisle, Uttoxeter and Kempton Park have been rearranged by the British Horseracing Authority. The governing body is campaigning against the Treasury's proposal to introduce a single remote gambling tax, which would increase the 15% tax rate paid by bookmakers on racing and aligning it with online gaming, which is currently taxed at 21%. The BHA says this would have a "destructive impact" on the industry with its economic analysis predicting an estimated £330m loss in revenue and putting 2,752 jobs at risk in the first year alone. "British Racing is already in a precarious financial position and research has shown that a tax rise on racing could be catastrophic for the sport and the thousands of jobs that rely on it in towns and communities across the country," added Dunshea. We haven't taken this decision lightly but in doing so we are urging the Government to rethink this tax proposal to protect the future of our sport which is a cherished part of Britain's heritage and culture."

Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the “evolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.” U.S. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.

Article: That campaign, detailed in July in technical reports from the Ukrainian government and several cybersecurity companies, is the first known instance of Russian intelligence being caught building malicious code with large language models (LLMs), the type of AI chatbots that have become ubiquitous in corporate culture. Cybersecurity firms and researchers are using AI now, too — feeding into an escalating cat-and-mouse game between offensive hackers who find and exploit software flaws and the defenders who try to fix them first. Earlier this month, Adkins announced that her team had so far discovered at least 20 important overlooked bugs in commonly used software and alerted companies so they can fix them. But that will advance.” Adam Meyers, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, said that not only is his company using AI to help people who think they’ve been hacked, he sees increasing evidence of its use from the Chinese, Russian, Iranian and criminal hackers that his company tracks. The shift is only starting to catch up with hype that has permeated the cybersecurity and AI industries for years, especially since ChatGPT was introduced to the public in 2022. Scammers and social engineers — the people in hacking operations who pretend to be someone else, or who write convincing phishing emails — have been using LLMs to seem more convincing since at least 2024. But using AI to directly hack targets is only just starting to actually take off, said Will Pearce, the CEO of DreadNode, one of a handful of new security companies that specialize in hacking using LLMs. Alexei Bulazel, the senior cyber director at the White House National Security Council, said at a panel at the Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas last week that the trend will hold, at least as long as the U.S. “That’s the point at which I think it becomes a little dangerous.” Meyers, of CrowdStrike, said that the rise of agentic AI — tools that conduct more complex tasks, like both writing and sending emails or executing code that programs — could prove a major cybersecurity risk.

His remarks came as Trump signaled he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal — aligning the United States with the Kremlin rather than Kyiv and its European backers. Zelenskyy’s message was accompanied by a joint statement from the leaders of eight Nordic and Baltic countries, stressing that a lasting peace “requires a ceasefire,” while calling for “credible security guarantees for Ukraine.” That is one area where Trump appears to have taken a step toward a position more aligned with the wishes of Ukraine and Europe. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump].” The security guarantees would be made in the scenario that Russia were to invade Ukraine, again, after a would-be peace deal, the sources said.

Article: — Word travels fast in this small town, so when Theoangelo Perkins heard that the family of Bill Parker was visiting his grave, he jumped in his car and raced to the old cemetery. Parker was laid to rest near the entrance with other members of the White family whose ancestors, named Wallace, once owned this land and were the second-largest enslavers in Shelby County. Nearby lies a much larger area, where the Black people who worked the land, as enslaved people or sharecroppers, and their descendants have been buried for more than a century. “And when I was small, my dad, my granddad and I would keep the cemetery up — at least the Black section of it.” At the cemetery, Perkins confronted Nell Gottlieb, Parker’s cousin, who inherited the Wallace plantation house and had clear memories of spending parts of her childhood there. But he agreed to help, launching a journey that has included Gottlieb giving up her ownership of the plantation to establish a reconciliation-focused nonprofit that bears the Wallace family name. When Gottlieb, 80, spent summers in the house as a child in the 1950s there was no indoor plumbing, so they had to get water from either the well or the tank that caught rainwater on the back porch. “We used to go across Highway 25 and get corn out of the cornfield and have it for dinner.” Advertisement Advertisement Gottlieb got her education on Southern heritage there too, listening to her grandmother’s stories about the family’s role in the “gallant South” and the Lost Cause, a telling of American history that romanticizes the Confederacy and downplays the role of slavery in the Civil War. … I knew chapter and verse of everybody who fought in the Civil War.” When her grandmother, a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, took her to the then-segregated Alabama Theatre in downtown Birmingham to see “Gone With the Wind,” Gottlieb loved the movie so much that they stayed and watched it a second time. She was too young to understand all the dynamics, she said, but thought of the Wallace house as she rooted for Scarlett O’Hara, the film’s protagonist, who fights to save her family’s cotton plantation. Advertisement Advertisement By then she had become one of the most liberal members of her family, she said, and tried to limit contact with relatives she believed harbored racist and antisemitic views. It wasn’t until Congress passed the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing, that many were able to spread out to other parts of town. Advertisement But it remains a community divided: Nearly a quarter of Black residents live in poverty compared with 6 percent of White residents, according to the most recent census data. Advertisement Advertisement When Perkins was first elected mayor of Harpersville in 2004, he became the first Black person to lead any town in Shelby County, where 72 percent of the population is White. Once Gottlieb agreed to open up cemetery access, Perkins decided it was time for Harpersville to come to terms with the plantation that helped shape its history — and heal. “But how can we give it a new narrative and use it to bring people together?” The first step was a ceremony rededicating the cemetery, which included several members of Gottlieb’s family as well as Black descendants of the plantation. “I’m an outsider, I’m a White man, I am a descendant of enslavers, and I’m coming into this community that is very foreign to me and that I have not had a lot of exposure to,” Hoynes said. “But I felt surprisingly welcome there, and that was remarkable.” Also in attendance was Henry Smith, who had grown up in Harpersville and knew that his great-grandfather Anderson Wallace was born into slavery there. But he said he had no idea before the cemetery reconciliation effort that the once-grand home off Highway 25, which he passed every day on the bus ride to his segregated school, had been the plantation house of the family who enslaved his ancestors. With the fence gate now open, he visited the grave site of his son, Norman Smith, who died in 1990 at the age of 23, for the first time in years. Since then, the center has raised money for college scholarships for Black descendants and hosted art exhibits seeking to reframe the history of the land around the enslaved people who worked there and their descendants. They did so, Hoynes said, in part to acknowledge that the work of those enslaved at the plantation created opportunities that were passed down through the generations to the White families. “But I just feel like I’m in a point in life where I have the time and the energy and the motivation to participate in something that I hope will make some small corner of the world better. And this is the place that, for better or worse, I have a personal connection to.” Other modern-day plantation owners also have reached out to the descendants of those whom their ancestors enslaved, especially during and after the 2020 racial justice protests, said Derek Alderman, a University of Tennessee professor who researches contemporary uses of Southern plantations. But Howard said that as some White descendants lost interest, the center, to keep the board’s racial balance, recruited White residents of Shelby County who were not related to the Wallace family. “So that’s what we’re really working on, broadening the descendant engagement.” When the center approached Peter Datcher, whose great-grandmother Lucy Baker was enslaved on the plantation, about joining the effort, he was skeptical. Datcher said he was only convinced once Gottlieb told him that she “realized that our wealth was on the back of your ancestors.” Advertisement Advertisement Hoynes and Gottlieb say they want to provide some kind of compensation to the descendants of enslaved and sharecropper families but are still trying to figure out how much and how.

Teller (whose given name, now legally changed, was Raymond Joseph Derickson Teller) said the most important tip he had received about artistic partnership came from the director Arthur Penn, who made their feature movie “Penn & Teller Get Killed” (1989). Pressed to clarify, he said, “I don’t care much about my relationship with Teller.” It’s worth pausing to remind you that magicians are professional liars — and Jillette delights in provocative statements. He said “The Aristocrats,” a 2005 documentary he and Paul Provenza directed about a very dirty joke, was really about the improvisation of Miles Davis (who is not in the movie). Whereas Jillette, wearing an earring and jeans with a peace sign, talks in digressive, full-paragraph monologues, Teller, dressed more unassumingly, speaks precisely and directly, gentle and economical in his answers, sensitive to the listener in a way that Jillette isn’t.

Article: And this is precisely the manoeuvre that was pulled by US President Donald Trump, who on Friday rolled out the red carpet in Alaska for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The short-lived encounter was ultimately anticlimactic, with Trump offering the incisive assessment that “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.” Fox News reported that Trump had rated the much-anticipated meeting with Putin a “10” out of 10 and that he particularly “appreciated the Russian president’s comments when he claimed he would not have invaded Ukraine had Trump won the 2020 presidency”. When US Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump in May on the Justice Department’s review of the content of the so-called “Epstein files”, she reportedly informed the president that his name appeared therein. On July 12, the president took to social media with his signature preference for manic capitalisation to berate those demanding declassification: “We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people’ are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.” And yet this is not the only headache facing the “PERFECT Administration” from within Trump’s own MAGA base, many of whose prominent members have become vocally critical of Israel’s genocide in the Gaza Strip, which Trump persists in aiding and abetting. Furthermore, according to the UN, the Israeli military has killed at least 1,760 Palestinians since late May alone, as they sought aid, including at sites run by the nefarious so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Backed by the US and Israel, the GHF has not only served Israel’s plans for mass displacement and forced eviction of Palestinians; the aid distribution hubs have also functioned as a sort of one-stop shop for indiscriminate killing – which, after all, is the whole point of genocide. And while Trump has intermittently chided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the disagreeable optics of the whole spectacle, it has not been sufficient to appease the scrutiny of the likes of right-wing US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a traditional ally of the president known for such antics as wearing a hat imprinted with the words “Trump Was Right About Everything!” Advertisement In a social media post last month, Greene – a leading figure in Trump’s MAGA movement – was unexpectedly explicit in her condemnation of “the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza”. Other MAGA fixtures like far-right influencer Laura Loomer – a self-defined “proud Islamophobe” and general bona fide sociopath – wasted no time in responding to Greene’s post: “There is no genocide in Gaza.” Anyway, political tensions and infighting were at least temporarily removed from the spotlight by the Trump-Putin extravaganza in Alaska. His commitment to waging genocide in Gaza has more than a little to do with his desire to stave off domestic opposition and avoid dealing with the assorted corruption charges in which he is presently embroiled.

Article: In 2020, when it came out that members of the elite Metropolitan Division were falsely labeling civilians as gang members in a police database, Lloyd was tapped to help unravel the mess. Sarah Dunster, 40, was a sergeant working in the LAPD’s Hollywood division in 2021 when she learned she was under investigation for allegedly mishandling a complaint against one of her officers, who was accused of groping a woman he arrested. Dunster was terminated over the incident, but she appealed and last week a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge granted a reprieve that allows her to potentially get her job back. Advertisement Others who have worked with Lloyd say he is regarded as a savvy investigator who is unfairly being vilified for discipline decisions that are ultimately made by the chief of police. A supervisor who oversaw Lloyd at Internal Affairs — and requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media — described him as smart, meticulous and “a bulldog.” “Joe just goes where the facts lead him and he doesn’t have an issue asking the hard questions,” the supervisor said. Other supporters point to his willingness to take on controversial cases to hold officers accountable, even while facing character attacks from his colleagues, their attorneys and the powerful Los Angeles Police Protective League. Advertisement Mario Munoz, a former LAPD Internal Affairs lieutenant who opened a boutique firm that assists officers fighting employment and disciplinary cases, recently released a scathing 60-page report questioning what he called a series of troubling lapses in the LAPD’s 2023 investigation of the Mission gang unit. The department accused several Mission officers of stealing brass knuckles and other items from motorists in the San Fernando Valley, and attempting to hide their actions from their supervisors by switching off their body-worn cameras. He alleged Lloyd ultimately singled out several “scapegoats to shield higher-level leadership from scrutiny.” Until he retired from the LAPD in 2014, Munoz worked as both an investigator and an auditor who reviewed landmark internal investigations into the beating of Black motorist Rodney King and the Rampart gang scandal in which officers were accused of robbing people and planting evidence, among other crimes. Advertisement In the Mission case, Munoz pointed to inconsistent outcomes for two captains who oversaw the police division accused of wrongdoing: One was transferred and later promoted, while another is fighting for his job amid accusations that he failed to rein in his officers. Both Garza and Gonzalez have sued the city, alleging that even though they reported the wrongdoing as soon as they became aware of it, they were instead punished by the LAPD after the scandal became public. The more Lloyd dug, the more instances he uncovered of these so-called “ghost stops.” A few months later, undercover Internal Affairs detectives began tailing the two involved officers — something that Garza and Gonzalez both claimed they were kept in the dark about. Advertisement In an interview with The Times, Gonzalez — the sergeant who is facing termination — recalled a moment during a recorded interrogation that he found so troubling he contacted the police union director Jamie McBride, to express concern. He said that while he couldn’t discuss Lloyd specifically due to state personnel privacy laws, in general the department assigns higher-profile Internal Affairs cases to detectives with a proven track record.

Article: Deep in the badlands of defeat, Democrats have soul-searched about what went wrong last November, tinkered with a thousand-plus thinkpieces and desperately cast for a strategy to reboot their stalled-out party. Advertisement As Texas Democrats dig in to block a Republican-led redistricting push and Trump muscles to consolidate power wherever he can, Newsom wants to redraw California’s own congressional districts to favor Democrats. Advertisement But the distinct scent of his home state will be hard to completely slough off in parts of the country where California is synonymous with loony lefties, business-killing regulation and an out-of-control homelessness crisis. To say nothing of Newsom’s ill-fated dinner at an elite Napa restaurant in violation of COVID-19 protocols — a misstep that energized a failed recall attempt and still haunts the governor’s national reputation. Advertisement A POLITICO-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll found that voters prefer keeping an independent panel in place to draw district lines by a nearly two-to-one margin, and that independent redistricting is broadly popular in the state. (Newsom’s press office argued that the poll was poorly worded, since it asked about getting rid of the independent commission altogether and permanently returning line-drawing power to the legislators, rather than just temporarily scrapping their work for several cycles until the independent commission next draws new lines.) California voters should not expect to see a special election campaign focused on the minutia of reconfiguring the state’s congressional districts, however. While many opponents will likely attack the change as undercutting the will of California voters, who overwhelmingly supported weeding politics out of the redistricting process, bank on Newsom casting the campaign as a referendum on Trump and his devious effort to keep Republicans in control of Congress. Newsom employed a similar strategy when he demolished the Republican-led recall campaign against him in 2021, which the governor portrayed as a “life and death” battle against “Trumpism” and far-right anti-vaccine and antiabortion activists. Wake up to his war on science, public health, his war against the American people.” Advertisement Kevin Liao, a Democratic strategist who has worked on national and statewide campaigns, said his D.C. Some messages have also ended with Newsom’s initials (a riff on Trump’s signature “DJT” signoff) and sprinkled in key Trumpian callbacks, like the phrase “Liberation Day,” or a doctored Time Magazine cover with Newsom’s smiling mien. Shortly after Trump took office in January, Newsom walked a fine line between criticizing the president and his policies and being more diplomatic, especially after the California wildfires — in hopes of appealing to any semblance of compassion and presidential responsibility Trump possessed. Advertisement Newsom had spent the first months of the new administration trying to reshape the California-vs.-Trump narrative that dominated the president’s first term and move away from his party’s prior “resistance” brand. Those conciliatory overtures coincided with Newsom’s embrace of a more ecumenical posture, hosting MAGA leaders on his podcast and taking a position on transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports that contradicted the Democratic orthodoxy. Of late, Newsom has defended the juvenile tone of his press aides’ posts mocking Trump’s own all-caps screeds, and questioned why critics would excoriate his parody and not the president’s own unhinged social media utterances. “To a certain set of folks who operated under the old rules, this could be seen as, ‘Wow, this is really outlandish.’ But I think they are making the calculation that Democrats want folks that are going to play under this new set of rules that Trump has established,” Liao said.

Article: Edidiong Chrys, a second-generation Nigerian American, said she thinks the 1% tax passed as part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would directly affect the financial lifeline she sends overseas. The Center for Global Development, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on reducing global poverty through economic research, published an analysis last month that listed the tax as yet another financial setback for many nations, given the recent reduction in American aid. The African Union’s outgoing ambassador to the United States, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, said hindering such funding “threatens to reverse gains in financial inclusion and development across the continent of Africa.” Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow with the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution’s Global Economy and Development program, said, “To put this tax on is just a further constraint on the U.S. “When you add it up with the visa blockages, with the end of the [African Growth and Opportunity Act] AGOA, with the end of USAID, it’s just building a wall,” he said. is building a wall between itself and the world and certainly between itself and Africa.” Suka-Mafudze, whose focus will turn toward the Southern African Development Community region, said that beyond hurting diplomatic ties, blocking remittances is also “a human issue, because diaspora remittances are lifelines for millions of African families and these remittances often cover essentials, which are food, school fees, medical care and a lot of things. And to impose a tax on that is deeply unjust.” Chrys said the financial burden of sending money home is already heavy, with some stretching limited resources to make ends meet. Suka-Mafudze backs the legislation, warning the new tax “could push people toward informal or unregulated channels, making transactions riskier and less transparent.” Cherfilus-McCormick, the only Haitian American member of Congress right now, warns that a remittance tax would unfairly burden families already struggling to support their loved ones overseas. “H.R.4586 — AIDA intends to reverse course and instead focus on incentivizing and leveraging on the nearly 100 billion of dollars that Haitian, African and Caribbean Americans send home each year to build sustainable partnerships and strengthen economic development.” Schneidman said the tax has the potential to impact education, health care and families because the bulk of the remittances are family-to-family.

Article: 25 June 2025, Netherlands, Den Haag: French President Emmanuel Macron (l-r), Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO, Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, Keir Starmer, Prime Minister of Great Britain, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) sit together at the so-called E5 meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit. Trump signaled Saturday that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal — aligning the United States with the Kremlin rather than Kyiv and its European backers. As Ukraine and Europe work out how best to move forward, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that they would be joining Zelenskyy, perhaps hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office meeting. "The talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression." The news came ahead of a virtual meeting of the so-called "coalition of the willing," which includes more than 30 countries working together to support Ukraine. While Trump's reversal on pursuing a ceasefire before fuller peace talks fueled alarm on the continent, he did appear to have taken a step toward another position more aligned with the wishes of Ukraine and Europe. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump]."

The sources said that those protections, as discussed by the White House, would not include NATO membership — despite European leaders saying in a joint statement Saturday that Ukraine should be given the right to seek NATO membership. For civilians on the ground, still under Russian attack even as the diplomatic maneuvering played out, it was not just the substance but the optics of the Alaska talks that caused frustration.

Article: The move in relation to the key White House meeting is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Trump in February. KYIV, Ukraine — European and NATO leaders will join Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his crucial meeting with President Donald Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday. The move in relation to the key White House meeting on Monday is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Trump in the Oval Office in February. The European leaders’ presence at Zelenskyy’s side, demonstrating Europe’s support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Zelenskyy risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Trump says he wants to broker with Russia.

Article: senator who lost to Cleveland auto dealer Bernie Moreno in last year’s election, has decided to run for the Senate seat JD Vance had before he was elected vice president. When he and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were seen huddling in a Columbus restaurant in late July, it seemed clear to political insiders Schumer was part of a recruitment campaign to convince Brown to run in 2026. The news that the 72-year-old Brown is running has been enthusiastically heralded by Ohio Democrats who see it as a recruitment coup for the party in its uphill battle to unseat Husted, who was appointed by Gov. Husted cast his lot with the top 10% over the welfare of working Ohioans when he voted for Trump’s debt-ballooning $4 trillion tax cut to the ultra-rich on the backs of the poor. So in 2026, without Trump leading the ticket, Husted could be vulnerable to a well-experienced challenger with a chip on his shoulder who can effectively energize an already highly motivated base to turn out in droves for the midterms. But a sufficient number of Ohioans is likely to be fighting mad about sky-high prices, shuttered factories, dropped health insurance, shredded safety nets, gutted public services and a reduction in vital veterans’ support. Brown will work to make Husted own the pain caused to Ohio families who will lose their SNAP benefits, to Ohio veterans who will be denied care to due to mass staffing cuts and eliminated services, and to the strategically delayed (until after the midterms) Medicaid cuts and work requirements that could leave 440,000 Ohioans uninsured. Expect Brown to lead the charge for human dignity over despair, justice over lawlessness, better outcomes for everyday Americans over what the Trumpian plutocracy offers in scraps to everyone but the favored wealthy. Expect him to launch a sustained offensive against Husted’s rubber-stamp endorsement of historic cuts to Medicaid and food assistance that will be paid for by hundreds of thousands of uninsured and hungry constituents. If Brown can make it personal with Ohio voters who feel betrayed by Husted and his party, who are drowning in the cost of living, struggling to afford tariff-inflated groceries, utilities, out-of-pocket medical care and ever rising rent on incomes stretched to the max, he can win. If he can make it personal with Ohio farmers reeling from Trump's funding cuts to promised subsidies and market-destroying tariffs slapped on key trading partners, he can broaden his appeal in rural communities. If he can make it personal on immigrants Ohioans know and respect being treated like dogs as masked thugs raid farms and Home Depot parking lots to stuff them into unmarked vans to be disappeared, he can be a welcomed voice for humanity, decency and the rule of law to forcefully counter a lawless Trump regime Husted supports. In addition to having to defend the big, awful bill to constituents on the losing end of unpaid-for giveaways to the wealthiest Americans, Husted, a former state lawmaker, will also have to defend himself from the stench of being associated with a bribery scandal that involved the utility company FirstEnergy spending $61 million for a $1 billion bailout and resulted in a former Republican Ohio House Speaker being sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. Text messages between a FirstEnergy CEO and a vice president who have since been charged in an alleged federal racketeering conspiracy related to the bribery scandal include descriptions of phone conversations they say they had with Husted about the legislation— some he apparently initiated — and reveal that they considered him the lawmaker handling the details of the bailout legislation. If Brown taps into the growing movement demanding a course correction, raises enough money to compete with the ton of cash coming Husted’s way and reminds voters why they sent him to the U.S.

Article: NBC News reports that “Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.” According to NBC News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said, unprompted, at three out of her four press briefings in July that Trump deserves the prize. Trump has also “posted about the prize a total of seven times on his social media site since his second term began, six of them in June and July,” NBC News reports. Stoltenberg confirmed in a statement that he spoke to Trump about tariffs but would not go into further details of the call.”) Trump’s Nobel Prize campaign — and his conviction that he is entitled to one — is of course absurd. Alfred Nobel called in his will for the prize to be awarded to individuals “who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” How would Trump fit the bill? There is some truth to the Trump administration’s claim that it has played a diplomatic role in mediating the end of conflict between some nations, including between India and Pakistan and between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However in the case of India and Pakistan, India objects to Trump’s claim that he was responsible for the May ceasefire between India and Pakistan; the Indian government describes the resolution as something that was brokered bilaterally between only India and Pakistan, and has downplayed Trump’s role. Even granting that the Trump administration has played a role in conflict resolution between some countries, the general spirit of Trump’s foreign policy has often undermined global “fraternity,” not fostered it. Under the banner of “America First,” Trump has shattered the bonds of economic cooperation by launching global trade wars, has reneged on pivotal agreements with our neighbors, and turned long-standing allies in Europe into rivals. On a particularly surreal note, one of the mediation agreements that the Trump administration lists in its case for Trump as a “president of peace” is the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran. He has supported Israel as it has killed civilians en masse in Gaza and effectively encouraged its ethnic cleansing project by talking about turning Gaza into an international beach resort. And while Trump’s efforts to help end Russia’s war on Ukraine is, in the abstract, a good thing, his extraordinary deference toward Russia during negotiations reflects a pursuit of an imperialistic, autocrat-friendly “peace” in the global order. “His claims to Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc., as well as tariff wars and the assaults on America’s democratic institutions, incline governments in the opposite direction.” Trump’s demand for a Nobel Peace Prize while causing global chaos and backing imperialism is yet another stroke of Orwellian audacity from our president.

Protesters, who fear further fighting could endanger the 50 captives believed to remain in Gaza, only about 20 of whom are thought to be alive, chanted: “We don’t win a war over the bodies of hostages.” “Military pressure doesn’t bring hostages back – it only kills them,” former captive Arbel Yehoud said at a demonstration in Tel Aviv’s so-called “Hostage Square”. “The only way to bring them back is through a deal, all at once, without games.” Police said they had arrested 32 as part of the nationwide demonstration – one of the fiercest since the uproar over six captives found dead in Gaza last September. Sunday’s rallies came just days after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to advance on Gaza City, nearly two years into a genocidal war that has devastated the enclave, left much of its population on the brink of famine, and led to Israel being increasingly internationally isolated. “We will shut down the country today with one clear call: Bring back the 50 hostages, end the war,” the group said, pledging to escalate their campaign with a protest tent near the Gaza border. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv that while protests were spread across the country, turnout remained relatively small. “The number of people is pretty small … I do expect it to increase during the day,” he said, noting many shops, restaurants and universities were closed, with public transport running at half capacity. “It’s not a general strike in the sense that people envisage, but it is palpable, it’s tangible, you can feel it in the air.” On Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s response to the unrest, Pinkas was scathing. He is driven by some Messianic delusions of redrawing the Middle East.” Pinkas added that Netanyahu was deflecting public anger by blaming “the elites” and a “deep-state cabal” rather than taking responsibility. Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich denounced them as “a perverse and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas,” while Culture Minister Miki Zohar said blocking roads “is a serious mistake and a reward to the enemy”.

Article: Hollywood stuntman set on fire for Pink Floyd cover dies aged 88 42 minutes ago Share Save Kathryn Armstrong BBC News Share Save Kevin Winter/Getty Images Ronnie Rondell's career spanned more than 50 years and included dozens of TV and film credits Ronnie Rondell Jr - who was famously set alight for the front cover of Pink Floyd's iconic Wish You Were Here album cover - has died at the age of 88. Rondell was born in California in 1937 and got his first acting role as a teenager in the early 1950s in the film Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair. Between the 1960s and 1990s he worked on several US TV series, including Charlie's Angels, Dynasty and Baywatch, as well as movies such as Spartacus, Diamonds are Forever and The Karate Kid. One of his best-known stunts was leaping from a pole that was on fire as it toppled over - a feat he performed for the 1963 adventure film Kings of the Sun. He was also involved in fighting scenes in the 1965 film Shenandoah, which was set during the US Civil War, a bar brawl in the 1974 Western comedy Blazing Saddles and impressive fire scenes in The Towering Inferno, which was released the same year.

Article: The president had announced the sweeping levies back on April 2, and their initial size sent stocks reeling before a series of walk-backs from the White House eased investors' concerns. Lately, investors have been betting that Trump won't implement the most draconian of his trade plans, in what has come to be known as the TACO trade, short for "Trump Always Chickens Out." But the duties that Trump announced in early April have in large part taken hold. "When you look at our major trading partners, most of what was put on the board on April 2 is on the board now." Catalysts for instability Trump's tariffs have faced significant legal challenges, with a federal appeals court judge seeming skeptical in late July of the president's claim that he has the authority to impose new tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), a law that grants the president authority to regulate international commerce in response to a national emergency. "The Supreme Court is likely to rule against Trump's use of IEEPA within the next 10 months." One reason countries continue to negotiate is the assumption that Trump could pivot to use another authority if his IEEPA claim is struck down, said Ed Mills, managing director and Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. For example, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 — the original Smoot-Hawley protectionist legislation — allows a president to implement tariffs of up to 50% on imported goods from countries that discriminate against U.S. The president could meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping "around the [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit" in the fall, though "what happens at that meeting is a big wild card," Mills said. "I think that the larger the trading partner is, the more likely they are going to find a way to get to yes." 'Priced out' risk Even with some of Trump's tariffs going into effect, the stock market has soared to all-time highs this summer, underscoring optimism that the U.S.

Article: People in Bolivia are headed to the polls to elect the next president as well as the members of the Congress, with the governing socialists expected to lose power after almost 20 years due to a deep economic crisis and division within the leftist coalition. But two candidates appear to have a comfortable lead: Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, who served as interim president and vice president under former military ruler Hugo Banzer, and Samuel Doria Mediana, a wealthy businessman and former planning minister. Absenteeism, blank ballots, undecided voters, all of it,” Morales told Radio Kawsachun Coca, his media outlet in the Bolivian jungle of Chapare, where he has been holed up for months among fiercely loyal coca-growing labour unions. ‘Worst crisis in a generation’ The Andean country is struggling through its worst crisis in a generation, marked by annual inflation of almost 25 percent and critical shortages of dollars and fuel. “We will change everything, absolutely everything after 20 lost years,” said the tough-talking Quiroga, who trained as an engineer in the United States, during his closing rally in La Paz on Wednesday. Bolivia enjoyed more than a decade of strong growth and Indigenous upliftment under Morales, who nationalised the gas sector and ploughed the proceeds into social programmes that halved extreme poverty during his stint in power between 2006 and 2019.

Article: TORONTO, ON — Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada’s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

Article: The mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County. “People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 'A ticking time bomb' The species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.” Last year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.” The Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. One of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.” In addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance. “They are just relentless biters.” Unlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water. “One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.” What that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing. “You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.

Article: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a temporary ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia is “not off the table,” even though U.S., Ukrainian and Russian leaders agree that the best outcome is a peace deal that permanently ends the war. “It was agreed to by all that the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal,” Rubio told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” “There’s no doubt about that. I mean, who would be against the fact that tomorrow we came to you and said, ‘We have a full peace deal, and it’s done.’ I think that’s the best way to end the war.” “Now, whether there needs to be a ceasefire on the way there, well, we’ve advocated for that,” Rubio added. “Unfortunately, the Russians, as of now, have not agreed to that.” Rubio’s comments come days after President Donald Trump returned from Alaska, where he met for several hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a delegation of Russian leaders. president told reporters, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.” Later in the “Meet the Press” interview, Rubio placed blame on Putin for not moving toward a ceasefire, responding to questions about Russia’s continued strikes in Ukraine over the last few days. Zelenskyy is headed to the White House on Monday to meet with Trump and other European leaders, including Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and U.K. Rubio on Sunday spoke more about the Trump administration’s decision not to impose new sanctions on Russia, despite Putin’s reluctance to move toward a peace deal, saying, “What we’re trying to do right now is end the war.” “If we’re not going to be able to reach an agreement here at any point, then there are going to be consequences, not only the consequences of the war continuing, but the consequences of all those sanctions continuing, and potentially new sanctions on top of it as well. The minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians and try to get them to the table to reach a peace agreement. “There has to be talk about how Ukraine is rebuilt, and how do you rebuild a country that’s been attacked as often as it has over the last three and a half years.” “These are all key elements of any agreement. Looking at a map of the territory in Ukraine that Russia has occupied, Rubio added, “Ultimately, if the Ukrainians are not willing to give that up, and no one’s pushing Ukraine to give that up — and so I don’t think that’s what — there’s going to be a peace deal. It’s not going to look like that.” The secretary of state added that Putin is “certainly asking for things that the Ukrainians and others are not willing to be supportive of and that we’re not going to push them to give, and the Ukrainians are asking for things that the Russians are not going to give up on.” Rubio also wouldn’t comment on what the United States’ role could look like in potential security guarantees, though Trump has maintained that a potential peace deal would not include a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. NBC News previously reported that Trump spoke with Zelenskyy and European leaders over the phone phone early Saturday morning about a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine that includes the U.S. “I mean, it’s one of their fundamental demands — is that if this war were to end, they have to make sure this never happens again.” “In order for there be a peace, the Russian side is going to have to accept that Ukraine is a sovereign country that has a right to defend itself and has a right to enter into alliances with other countries to defend itself.

Article: In August 2024, a coalition including far-right law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) and Inspire Investing — which bills itself as “empowering Christian investors through biblically responsible investing” — sent letters to Costco, Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons and McKesson urging them not to start dispensing mifepristone. A coalition including far-right law firm Alliance Defending Freedom and Inspire Investing — which bills itself as “empowering Christian investors through biblically responsible investing” — sent letters to Costco, Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons and McKesson urging them not to start dispensing mifepristone. In a statement shared with MSNBC, Costco said, “Our position at this time not to sell mifepristone, which has not changed, is based on the lack of demand from our members and other patients, who we understand generally have the drug dispensed by their medical providers.” The company did not respond to a follow-up question about how it assessed demand for a medication it doesn’t dispense. The Washington Post reports that Costco had deliberated for more than a year about whether to offer mifepristone and decided this month not to do so; the paper cites anonymous sources familiar with the conversations. As the organization’s corporate engagement legal counsel Michael Ross told Bloomberg News, “It’s a very significant win and it’s one we hope to build on this coming year.” Ross added that ADF will turn its focus to CVS and Walgreens, which have been dispensing the drug in states where abortion is legal since early 2024. A month later, 20 Republican attorneys general wrote to CVS and Walgreens and claimed that they might be in violation of a federal law known as the Comstock Act, an anti-obscenity statute passed in 1873. But the same day as the pharmacy change, the Biden administration’s Department of Justice released legal guidance saying that the Comstock Act can’t be enforced against the shipment of abortion drugs as long as the sender doesn’t know the pills will be used illegally. ADF’s letters to Costco and others cited the AGs’ claims on Comstock, and lobbed a threat that a change in administration could result in federal prosecutions should the retailers begin stocking mifepristone. Department of Justice cannot provide you cover if the administration changes parties.” The bigger picture here is that groups like ADF are not satisfied with only conservative-led states passing abortion bans. Their long-term goal is to ban nearly all abortions nationwide under the 14th Amendment, and they’re hoping that courts will aid them along the way to realizing that project by ruling that the Comstock Act is enforceable, or that the FDA was wrong to allow telemedicine prescriptions, or both. ADF took a case to the Supreme Court in 2024 from physicians seeking to end telemedicine prescriptions, and while the justices said those plaintiffs didn’t have standing to sue, that litigation continues thanks to three state AGs who joined the case. The Costco pressure campaign underscores that GOP lawmakers and groups like ADF know an abortion ban cannot pass Congress, so they are trying to limit access in other ways, namely by targeting pills and working to shutter clinics. Their goal is to make it so people can only get abortion medication by physically traveling to a shrinking number of clinics, with more set to shutter amid fallout from the GOP budget bill that “defunds” large abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. This context is why it’s so disappointing that Costco will not dispense mifepristone, a necessary medication for people who need abortions and people experiencing miscarriages — and one that is set to become increasingly difficult to access. ADF added in a press release after the Bloomberg story that it “applaud[s] Costco for doing the right thing by its shareholders and resisting activist calls to sell abortion drugs.” This isn’t about “selling” abortion pills. While many people do still receive the pill directly from their doctor either in person or by mail, telemedicine prescriptions are increasingly filled by mail-order pharmacies like Honeybee Health, and of course other pharmacies do dispense the drug. Retail pharmacies exist to serve the health and wellness of their customers, but abortion drugs like mifepristone undermine that mission by putting women’s health at risk.” Data shows that abortion restrictions are not only bad for people’s health, but also bad for the economy. And in June, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) estimated that the Dobbs decision has led to $64 billion in economic losses each year in the 16 states that ban or heavily restrict abortion.

Article: Six-time MotoGP champion Marc Marquez has marked the 1,000th premier class race in history by winning the Austrian Grand Prix for the first time in his career to take a mammoth 142-point lead over his brother Alex in the championship. Gresini Racing rookie Fermin Aldeguer found late race pace to finish second while Aprilia’s pole sitter Marco Bezzecchi, who kept Marquez at bay for as long as he could, finished third. Next week, we have another race.” Bezzecchi had claimed his first pole with Aprilia on Saturday, and despite finishing fourth in the sprint, this time he had the perfect launch to lead Francesco Bagnaia and Marc Marquez into turn one. The two Ducatis went side by side on lap one when Marc Marquez briefly overtook his teammate, but Bagnaia did not relent and took the place back to stay in second. Alex Marquez had a poor start, and with a long-lap penalty to serve for causing a crash at the Czech Grand Prix, the younger Marquez sibling fell out of the top 10 when he rejoined the field. Bagnaia had been undefeated in Austria for three years, but he was a shadow of the ringmaster who had dominated at the Red Bull Ring since 2022 as he was bumped down to eighth. Marquez finally attacked on lap 19 and squeezed past the Aprilia, but Bezzecchi put his head down and took first place back from the Spaniard, eager to deny him a first victory at the Red Bull Ring. As Bezzecchi made a futile attempt to reel Marquez in, Aldeguer made a play for second place, and the Gresini rookie made his move with five laps to go on turn one to slot in behind Marquez.

NATO's Article 5 says that "if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that she welcomed the security guarantees for Ukraine, and that the "European Union ...

Article: Amazon announced Wednesday that it will expand its same-day delivery of perishable items like meat and dairy to more than 1,000 cities, with plans to reach at least 2,300 locations by year-end. But Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma said the sell-off for Instacart and DoorDash may have been overdone as there's enough room in the segment for the competitors to maintain market share. "We believe the sell-off in CART and DASH (on the back of the AMZN news) was overdone, with room for the online penetration rates to expand and retailers to increasingly lean into the platforms," Ma wrote in a Thursday note. and these retailers now need to lean further into the on-demand platforms to compete with AMZN (we saw this post-Whole Foods acquisition); and CART has one of the best products with competitive free delivery thresholds, a wide variety of merchant selection, quick delivery windows (40% of orders are priority), and cost efficiency (optimized network, gig worker model)," the analyst said. "We will continue to monitor for evidence on AMZN's encroachment, but for now remain optimistic on the path forward — powered by core Restaurant delivery but also expansion areas and normalized margin opportunity," she added. Ma's opinion on DoorDash shares is slightly more optimistic than the average analyst as the consensus view is a potential 17% advance for the stock over the next 12 months. Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz also expects that Instacart and DoorDash can remain competitive as the pair benefit from a perception of quality and supply because customers can stick with their favorite grocery stores when using these services. "While much remains to be seen as to how this new product changes the grocery delivery landscape, we believe it most likely that it expands the grocery delivery pie more than cannibalizes current e-commerce volume over the short term," Horowitz said.

Article: In March, groups loyal to former President Bashar al-Assad clashed with government forces and allied armed factions in the coastal governorates of Latakia and Tartus, dominated by the Alawite community. President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who took power after al-Assad’s ouster, has so far failed to build trust across all factions, as his main focus has been international normalisation and economic development. His Islamist leanings are causing alarm among minorities, including the Druze, Alawites, Christians and Kurds, who fear that his inability to rein in the various armed factions may result in more violence. With the help of Gulf states, the Syrian president has been able to achieve a major diplomatic victory: the lifting of sanctions and the removal of the armed group he headed, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, from the list of “foreign terrorist organisations” by the United States government. The real challenge for the new Syrian government is to find a way to balance the urgent need for economic recovery with the equally crucial need to address people’s grievances. It provides the new leadership with the assurance of a controlled outcome and avoids the challenges of organising a nationwide vote at a time when Damascus does not have full control over all territories and security cannot be guaranteed. Given the deep-seated sectarian divisions and the decades of one-family rule by the al-Assad regime, which drew heavily on the Alawite minority, the new government cannot be the sole arbiter of justice.

Article: European leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his visit to Washington, DC, seeking an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, after United States President Donald Trump dropped both his push for a ceasefire and the threat of punitive actions against Russia following his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, more than three years after Russia’s invasion, had been one of Trump’s core demands before Friday’s Alaska summit, to which Ukraine and its European allies were not invited. Special US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday that Putin agreed at the summit with Trump to allow the US and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defence mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war. “We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” he said on the CNN news programme State of the Union. Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, speaking in Brussels on Sunday after meeting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said the current front lines of the war should be the basis for peace talks. “We need real negotiations, which means we can start where the front line is now,” Zelenskyy said, adding that European leaders support this and reiterating his long-held position that it was necessary to establish a ceasefire in order to then negotiate a final deal. Advertisement But after the summit on Friday with Putin yielded no clear breakthrough, Trump ruled out an immediate ceasefire – a move that aligns with Putin, who has long argued for negotiations on a final peace deal. According to a New York Times report, after his meeting with Putin, the US president also told European leaders that he had offered to support a plan to end the war that involved Ukraine giving up parts of its territory to Russia. Ukraine and its European allies have criticised Putin’s stance as a way to buy time and press Russia’s battlefield advances, and they have expressed unease over Trump’s land swap proposal from the outset. In an effort to try show a firm, united front to the US president in White House talks on Monday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and von der Leyen will accompany Zelenskyy to Washington, DC. “The talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression,” the German government said in a statement about the trip to the US capital. “This includes maintaining pressure on sanctions.” Ahead of the visit, von der Leyen said on X that she would welcome Zelenskyy for a meeting in Brussels on Sunday, which other European leaders would join by video, before accompanying the Ukrainian leader on his US trip at his “request” and with “other European leaders”. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) August 17, 2025 Strength and safety in numbers appear to be factors in the group visit, with memories still fresh about the hostile reception Zelenskyy received in February from Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance in a public White House dressing-down, castigating the Ukrainian leader as being ungrateful and “disrespectful”. No land swaps While Zelenskyy has welcomed Trump’s efforts to end the war, in a post on social media on Saturday, he warned that “it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades”. In exchange, Russian forces would halt their offensive in the Black Sea port region of Kherson and Zaporizhia in southern Ukraine, where the main cities are still under Ukrainian control. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian president said that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier” and pointed out that he doesn’t have the authority to sign off on land swaps. In an interview with broadcaster Fox News after his sit-down with Putin, Trump had suggested that the onus was now on Zelenskyy to secure a peace deal as they work towards an eventual trilateral summit with Putin. European powers, however, want to help set up a trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy to make sure Ukraine has a seat at the table to shape its future. “They will spell out what they consider essential in terms of security guarantees: what they can do themselves, what falls to the coalition of volunteers, and also what they expect from the United States,” a European government official told the Reuters news agency.

Article: Climate change-induced flash floods have killed at least 337 people in northwestern Pakistan, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, while dozens remain missing after the area was hit by flash floods in recent days. Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency service, said 54 bodies were found after hours-long efforts in Buner, a mountainous district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where torrential rains and cloudbursts triggered massive flooding on Friday. Advertisement Mohammad Iqbal, a schoolteacher in Pir Baba village, told the Associated Press that the lack of a timely warning system caused casualties and forced many to flee their homes at the last moment. “If people had been informed earlier, lives could have been saved and residents could have moved to safer places.” The government said that while an early warning system was in place, the sudden downpour in Buner was so intense that the deluge struck before residents could be alerted. Asfandyar Khan Khattak, director-general of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said there was “no forecasting system anywhere in the world” that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst. Pakistan suffers regular flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September, particularly in the rugged northwest, where villages are often perched on steep slopes and riverbanks.

Article: Terence Stamp: 1960s icon who was the 'master of the brooding silence' 8 minutes ago Share Save Share Save BBC Terence Stamp's dashing good looks and smouldering glare made him a star of 1960s cinema. With actress Julie Christie or supermodel Jean Shrimpton on his arm, he specialised in playing sophisticated villains: including Superman's arch nemesis, General Zod, and the petulant Sergeant Troy in Far From the Madding Crowd. Thirty years after his career began, he shocked his fans - but picked up a Golden Globe nomination - as Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Young Terence's interest in acting began to blossom when his mother took him to the local cinema to see Gary Cooper in Beau Geste, a film that left a deep impression on him. After enduring the Blitz in the east end of London, the Stamp family moved to the more genteel Plaistow - where Terence attended grammar school before getting the first of a series of jobs in advertising agencies. Having been turned down for National Service because of problems with his feet, he won a scholarship to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art - which got rid of his cockney accent. On one occasion, he found himself in a touring production of The Long and the Short and the Tall alongside another budding actor named Michael Caine, with whom he would later share a flat. His performance as the naïve young seaman, hanged for killing an officer in self-defence, won him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe for Best Newcomer. Getty Images Stamp shot to fame as Billy Budd - a 1962 film about a heroic, stammering 18th century seaman In the same year, he appeared in Term of Trial alongside Laurence Olivier. "Before a take, he'd say something to (co-star Carol White)," he complained, "and then he would say something to me, and we only discovered once the camera was rolling that he'd given us completely different directions. That's why he needed two cameras, because he needed the confusion and the spontaneity." Getty Images Terence Stamp and Julie Christie - as Sergeant Troy and Bathsheba Everdene - in Far From the Madding Crowd He was reunited with Julie Christie in Far From the Madding Crowd. But it wasn't hard, with somebody like Julie." With cinematographer Nicholas Roeg, Stamp helped choreograph the famous fencing demonstration scene: in which Sergeant Troy's sword skills captivate - and eventually seduce - Bathsheba Everdene. "Plus I wasn't his first choice: he really wanted Jon Voight." Getty Images Terence Stamp and Julie Christie on the poster for Far From the Madding Crowd But Stamp's star was beginning to fade. He was approached to play James Bond when Sean Connery relinquished the role, but his radical ideas of how he should interpret the character did not impress producer Harry Saltzman. "I didn't get a second call from him." Getty Images Terence Stamp's star faded as the 1960s came to a close There was a spell in Italy where he worked with the directors Pier Paolo Pasolini and Federico Fellini but, by the time he returned to London, the 60s were drawing to a close and he was no longer in fashion. But a female friend persuaded him to take the part - which saw his character journey across the outback with two drag queens, played by Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce. Alamy Stamp starred in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 1994 Over the next 10 years, Stamp appeared in two dozen films - playing a wide variety of parts.

Article: Israel’s military has stepped up attacks on Gaza City as part of its expanded operations aimed at seizing the last major population centre in the enclave, forcing tens of thousands of starving Palestinians to flee again. The Gaza City neighbourhoods of Zeitoun, Sabra, Remal and Tuffah have particularly borne the brunt of the Israeli bombardments in recent days as a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Israel’s plans to forcibly displace Palestinians to southern Gaza would increase their suffering. Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said tents and equipment to erect shelters will be provided to the Palestinians who have been displaced multiple times in 22 months of war, which has been called an act of genocide by multiple rights organisations. Advertisement ‘New wave of genocide’ Israel last week announced plans to push deeper into Gaza City and remove its residents to the south, a move that has drawn international condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, said civilians would be moved to “safe zones” even though these areas have also been repeatedly bombed. At least seven more Palestinians died of starvation in Gaza in 24 hours, Gaza’s Ministry of Health said on Sunday, raising the war’s hunger-related death toll to 258, including 110 children, as a result of Israel’s ongoing siege of the enclave. The UN says one in five children in Gaza is malnourished as tens of thousands rely on charity kitchens, whose small portions of food can be their only meal of the day. “I came at 6am to the charity kitchen to get food for my children, and if I don’t get any now, I have to come back in the evening for another chance,” said Zeinab Nabahan, displaced from the Jabalia refugee camp, told Al Jazeera. They’ve been waiting for me to leave with whatever I can get from the charity kitchen.” Advertisement Another resident, Tayseer Naim, told Al Jazeera that “had it not been for God and charity kitchens”, he would not have survived. We suffer a lot, and we leave at midday and walk for about a kilometre.” ‘Man-made famine’ On Sunday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned that Gaza is facing a “man-made famine” and urged a return to a UN-led distribution system. She said the crisis had been fuelled by “deliberate attempts to replace the UN-coordinated humanitarian system through the politically motivated ‘GHF’.” She warned the alternative system promoted by Israel and the United States “brings dehumanisation, chaos, and death” and stressed: “We must return to a unified, UN-led coordination and distribution system based on international humanitarian law. The abomination must end.” The World Food Programme (WFP) says despite its teams “doing everything” to deliver food assistance in Gaza, current supplies only meet 47 percent of the intended target. According to the UN agency, around 500,000 people are now on the “brink of famine”, and that only a ceasefire would allow food assistance to be scaled up to the required levels. The Government Media Office in Gaza said Israel was deliberately starving Palestinians by blocking essential goods, including baby formula, nutritional supplements, meat, fish, dairy products, and frozen fruits and vegetables. In a statement on Telegram, it said Israel was carrying out “a systematic policy of engineered starvation and slow killing against more than 2.4 million people in Gaza, including more than 1.2 million Palestinian children, in a complete crime of genocide”. We are linked to the people here, and we are staying with them while Israel threatens to apply its plans to forcibly evacuate Gaza City and destroy the rest of Gaza.

Article: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — European and NATO leaders announced Sunday they will join President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington for talks with President Donald Trump on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, with the possibility of U.S. READ MORE: Zelenskyy to meet Trump on Monday after U.S.-Russia summit secured no halt to war in Ukraine European leaders, including heavyweights France, Britain and Germany, are rallying around the Ukrainian leader after his exclusion from Trump’s summit on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Their pledge to be at Zelenskyy’s side at the White House on Monday is an apparent effort to ensure the meeting goes better than the last one in February, when Trump berated Zelenskyy in a heated Oval Office encounter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Zelenskyy, said “we welcome President Trump’s willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine. And the ‘coalition of the willing’ — including the European Union — is ready to do its share.” Von der Leyen was joined Sunday by French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb in saying they will take part in Monday’s talks at the White House, as will secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, Mark Rutte. The European leaders’ demonstration of support could help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Ukraine risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Trump says he wants to broker with Russia. Neil Melvin, director of international security at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said European leaders are trying to “shape this fast-evolving agenda.” After the Alaska summit, the idea of a ceasefire appears all-but-abandoned, with the narrative shifting toward Putin’s agenda of ensuring Ukraine does not join NATO or even the EU. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that a possible ceasefire is “not off the table” but that the best way to end the war would be through a “full peace deal.” Putin has implied that he sees Europe as a hindrance to negotiations. Speaking to the press after his meeting with Trump, the Russian leader raised the idea that Kyiv and other European capitals could “create obstacles” to derail potential progress with “behind-the-scenes intrigue.” For now, Zelenskyy offers the Europeans the “only way” to get into the discussions about the future of Ukraine and European security, says RUSI’s Melvin. In remarks made on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Witkoff said Friday’s meeting with Trump was the first time Putin has been had heard to agree to such an arrangement.

Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for Pakistan’s emergency service, said 54 bodies were found in Buner, a mountainous area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where torrential rains and cloudbursts triggered massive flooding on Friday. READ MORE: Flash floods triggered by torrential rains kill at least 176 people in India and Pakistan Suhail said villagers remain missing, and search efforts are focused on areas where homes were flattened by torrents of water that swept down from the mountains, carrying boulders that smashed into houses like explosions. Warnings of more intense rain to come Residents in Buner have accused officials of failing to warn them to evacuate after torrential rain and cloudbursts triggered deadly flooding and landslides. Asfandyar Khan Khattak, director-general of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said there was “no forecasting system anywhere in the world” that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst, a sudden and intense downpour. “If people had been informed earlier, lives could have been saved and residents could have moved to safer places.” People still missing Idrees Mahsud, a disaster management official, said Pakistan’s early warning system used satellite imagery and meteorological data to send alerts to local authorities. An emergency services spokesman in Buner, Mohammad Sohail, said more than half the damaged roads in the district had reopened by Sunday, allowing vehicles and heavy machinery to reach cut-off villages. In one of the deadliest incidents, 24 people from one family died in the village of Qadar Nagar when floodwaters swept through their home on the eve of a wedding. The country also suffers regular flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September, particularly in the rugged northwest, where villages are often perched on steep slopes and riverbanks.

Article: After meeting Putin, Trump changes his position on the need for a ceasefire toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North America KYIV – When President Trump was flying to Alaska for his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Trump said the main goal was a ceasefire. He said he'd be disappointed if it didn't happen, and warned of "severe consequences." But shortly after meeting Putin, Trump reversed himself and said a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war wasn't critical. He wrote on social media that "it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up." Sponsor Message Trump's new position aligns him with Putin, and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who's headed to the White House on Monday. Trump told Zelenskyy that, "You don't have the cards right now," and that the Ukrainian leader would have to make concessions with Russia to prevent the total destruction of his country. While they didn't announce any breakthroughs, Trump now looks to be on Putin's side when it comes to the critical question of whether to pursue an immediate ceasefire versus a comprehensive peace agreement, which would take lengthy negotiations. "The only way to have a ceasefire is for both sides to agree to stop firing at one another, and the Russians just haven't agreed to that." Zelenskyy will have additional support during Monday's visit. According to Ukrainian leaders, Putin believes time is on his side and he intends to keep fighting until he wins what he wants on the battlefield, or gets concessions from Ukraine. Russia's approach to negotiations At the Alaska summit, Putin again raised his favorite talking point — that the "root causes" of the conflict need to be addressed for a lasting peace. Russia now controls close to 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, yet is calling on Ukraine to give up additional land it still holds in the eastern part of the country, in the Donbas region. From Russia's perspective, agreeing to a ceasefire could cost the Russian military its momentum in the fighting, where Russia has been making incremental gains the past two years, though at an extremely high cost in casualties. "Everything is going to be about what the Ukrainians can live with." In the wake of the Alaska summit, the diplomatic debate is now focused on whether to work for a near-term ceasefire or a permanent peace agreement.

But today, Quincy is known for a more lucrative commodity: vast stretches of data centers powering the modern internet and artificial intelligence boom.

Firefighters are tackling 12 major wildfires in the northwestern region of Galicia alone, all of them near the city of Ourense, the head of the Galician regional government Alfonso Rueda also said during the news conference. In neighbouring Portugal, wildfires have burned about 1,550sq km (600sq miles) of vegetation so far this year, according to provisional data from the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests – three times the average for this period from 2006 to 2024. A national state of alert due to wildfires was imposed on August 2 and was due to end on Sunday, a day before two Swedish firefighting planes were to arrive.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — Russia’s Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. “We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” He added that it “was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that” and called them “game-changing.” Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members. WATCH: What Trump and Putin said – and didn’t say – after their meeting in Alaska Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not “go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. “We welcome President Trump’s willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the ‘Coalition of the willing’ — including the European Union — is ready to do its share,” she said. “It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine,” he said, “But there are no details how it will work, and what America’s role will be, Europe’s role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees,” he said. “We began to see some moderation in the way they’re thinking about getting to a final peace deal.” Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit. “Now, ultimately, if there isn’t a peace agreement, if there isn’t an end of this war, the president’s been clear, there are going to be consequences,” Rubio said on ABC’s “This Week.” “But we’re trying to avoid that.” WATCH: Security expert analyzes fallout of Trump’s alignment with Putin after their summit Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. “The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He also said “we’re not at the precipice of a peace agreement” and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work. He added: “The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians — that could not have been discussed at this meeting” with Putin. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon.” Associated Press writers John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.

The role came more than a decade after Stamp was nominated for an Oscar for his supporting role in the film “Billy Budd.” Though it won him no awards, the “Superman” franchise was a defining mark in Stamp’s acting career. Years later, Stamp would play another Kryptonian on the show “Smallville.” He voiced the hero’s father, Jor-El, on the show, which chronicled the life of a young Clark Kent before he chose to don the crimson cape in Metropolis. He kicked off his acting career with an Academy Award nomination for his debut film “Billy Budd” (1962) before going on to receive the Golden Globe for new star of the year in 1963. Later, he went on to play a transgender woman in “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” (1994) and continued to take roles in a variety of genres including thrillers, comedy and fantasy-adventure. His final role was in the 2021 horror-thriller “Last Night in Soho.” Stamp published a series of memoirs from 1987 to 2017, including his 2011 “Rare Stamps,” which detailed the most pivotal moments of his life. He described the book on his website as a look into the “tent poles that enabled me to keep a roof over my head for 50 years while I encouraged the artist within to show its face.”

Article: Met urged to scrap Carnival facial recognition plan 38 minutes ago Share Save James W Kelly BBC News Share Save Getty Images The Met is one of two police forces in England and Wales to deploy LFR widely in recent years - this has now expanded Civil liberty and anti-racism groups have called on the Metropolitan Police to drop plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, 11 organisations described LFR as "a mass surveillance tool that treats all Carnival-goers as potential suspects and has no place at one of London's biggest cultural celebrations". The groups - which include Liberty, Big Brother Watch and the Runnymede Trust - highlighted an ongoing judicial review brought by Shaun Thompson, a black Londoner who says he was wrongly identified by the system and detained. "Notting Hill Carnival is an event that specifically celebrates the British African Caribbean community, yet the [Metropolitan Police] is choosing to use a technology with a well-documented history of inaccurate outcomes and racial bias." Getty Images The Met says it will deploy 7,000 officers a day to police Carnival The letter also raised concerns over a 2023 National Physical Laboratory study, which found the NeoFace system used by the Met was less accurate for women and people of colour depending on the algorithm that has been set. The study's authors found the system could show bias at lower thresholds, though at the higher settings the Met says it uses, performance was found to be equitable across ethnicity and gender. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward, who is leading this year's policing operation at the carnival, said LFR had led to more than 1,000 arrests since the start of 2024 and that independent testing showed the system was "accurate and balanced with regard to ethnicity and gender" at the thresholds used by the Met. Getty Images Notting Hill Carnival can attract up to two million over the weekend Notting Hill Carnival takes place next weekend and has previously attracted up to two million people. "It is right that we make the best use of available technology to support officers to do their job more effectively." Mr Ward said the LFR cameras will be used on the approach to and from Carnival and not within the event boundaries.

Article: A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and a former parliamentarian wanted by the city’s Chinese authorities have been granted asylum in Britain and Australia, more than four years after facing criminal charges over the 2019 antigovernment protests. Tony Chung, an activist who was imprisoned under Hong Kong’s sweeping national security law, and Ted Hui, a former lawmaker facing trial for his role in the mass demonstrations, both announced over the weekend that they have received asylum in Britain and Australia, respectively, where they now live. Hui, who fled Hong Kong in December 2020, is part of a group of overseas activists for whom police have offered rewards of up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($127,800). The outspoken pro-democracy lawmaker is known for disrupting a legislative session by throwing a rotten plant in the chamber to stop a debate on a bill seeking to make it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem. Advertisement “I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of Australia – both present and former – for recognising our need for asylum and granting us this protection,” Hui wrote. Immigrants can always return to their home towns to visit relatives at any time; Exiles have no home.” Chung, who fled to Britain, had advocated for Hong Kong’s independence and was sentenced to almost four years in prison for secession and money laundering in 2020. “Any country that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong’s legal systems and barbarically interferes in the affairs of Hong Kong,” the statement read.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police blasted crowds with water cannons and made dozens of arrests on Sunday as thousands of protesters demanding a deal to free hostages in Gaza aimed to shut down the country with a one-day strike that blocked roads and closed businesses. Groups representing families of hostages organized the demonstrations as frustration grows in Israel over plans for a new military offensive in some of Gaza’s most populated areas, which many fear could further endanger the remaining hostages. WATCH: Netanyahu lashes out at critics of plan to occupy Gaza City as condemnation mounts Protesters gathered at dozens of places including outside politicians’ homes, military headquarters and on major highways. “Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas’ position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday called the demonstrations “a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas’ hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.” The new offensive would require the call-up of thousands of reservists, another concern for many Israelis. Hamza Asfour said he was just north of the corridor awaiting a convoy when Israeli snipers fired, first to disperse the crowds, then from tanks hundreds of meters (yards) away. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the Israeli-backed and U.S.-supported distribution points that have become the main source of aid since they opened in May, said there was no gunfire “at or near” its sites, which are located in military-controlled areas. Israel’s air and ground war has displaced most of Gaza’s population and killed more than 61,900 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children. Fears of the coming military offensive It is not clear when Israel’s military will begin the new offensive in the crowded Gaza City, Muwasi and what Netanyahu has called the “central camps” of Gaza. The military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, this weekend noted plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones to southern Gaza “for their protection.” Designated “safe zones,” however, also have been bombed during the war. “There are no humanitarian zones at all,” said Raghda Abu Dhaher, who said she has been displaced 10 times during the war and now shelters in a school in western Gaza City. Airstrike on power plant in Yemen Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s capital Sunday, escalating strikes on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who since the war in Gaza began have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea. While some projectiles have breached its missile defenses — notably during its 12-day war with Iran in June — Israel has intercepted the vast majority of missiles launched from Yemen.

Instead, he is reportedly planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line – a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska. "And the people of these regions – particularly the miners – played a huge role in the strengthening of the Ukrainian identity." The region had also produced "famous politicians, poets and dissidents", he said. "And now refugees who will not be able to return home if it becomes Russian." At least 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the Donbas since Russian aggression began in 2014. "You ask about the surrender of the Donetsk region, well, I measure this war not in kilometres but in human lives," said Yevhen Tkachov, 56, an emergency rescue worker in the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk. "But if Zelensky were to concede this land it would be not only a breakdown of our constitution, it could have the hallmarks of treason." And yet, it is not clear in Ukraine by what mechanism such an agreement could even be reached. There is no legal procedure set up because, you know, the constitution writers didn't think about this." Things may become more clear after Zelensky speaks with Trump in Washington on Monday – the Ukrainian leader's first visit to the White House since a disastrous clash in the Oval Office in February.

Midfielder Eberechi Eze rifled home a 13th-minute free-kick, but the goal was subsequently ruled out by VAR because Palace captain Marc Guehi was less than one metre away from the hosts' defensive wall. Chelsea responded in the second half by bringing on two more new attacking signings - £29m winger Estevao Willian, who joined from Palmeiras, and £30m former Ipswich striker Liam Delap. They both missed big chances, as did fellow substitute Andrey Santos, as the Blues were held to a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge in a disappointing start to the new season.

Article: Trump is leaning on Zelenskyy to strike an agreement after he met Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin in Alaska and emerged more aligned with Moscow on seeking a peace deal instead of a ceasefire first. and Russian leaders have discussed proposals for Russia to relinquish tiny pockets of occupied Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv ceding a swathe of fortified land in the east and freezing the front lines elsewhere. Top Trump officials hinted the fate of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region - which incorporates Donetsk and Luhansk and which is already mostly under Russian control - was on the line, while some sort of defensive pact was also on the table. "We were able to win the following concession, that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection," Trump envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN on Sunday, suggesting this would be in lieu of Ukraine seeking NATO membership. He said it was "the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that." Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty enshrines the principle of collective defense, the notion that an attack on a single member is considered an attack on them all. Ukraine's borders were already meant to have been guaranteed when Ukraine surrendered a Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in 1994, and it proved to be little deterrent when Russia absorbed Crimea in 2014 and then launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a meeting of allies on Sunday to bolster Zelenskyy's hand, hoping in particular to lock down robust security guarantees for Ukraine that would include a U.S. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will also travel to Washington, as will Finland's President Alexander Stubb, whose access to Trump included rounds of golf in Florida earlier this year, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is an admirer of many of Trump's policies.

Article: In May, his daughter Alisa earned two associate degrees — in mathematics and general science — from Crafton Hills College, a public community college in Yucaipa, California, where she matriculated as an 8-year-old. She's set to start at the University of California, Riverside this fall, studying for a bachelor's degree in computer science so she can eventually work in the tech industry, she says. Rafael, 51, left his full-time career as a trial attorney in San Bernardino, California, when Alisa was just 1 year old so the single dad could prioritize and educating her. I'm pretty far down the list of important things." Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals When Rafael initially chose to leave his career, Alisa was already mastering her ABCs and counting into the hundreds, he says. "I always had confidence that I would find a way to make it, no matter what." Establishing a regular routine By age 2, Alisa could read on her own, says Rafael. He home-schooled her until she was 8 — when she completed the coursework required by California to earn her high school diploma — choosing from different curricula and online teaching guides based on her interests and skill level. As Alisa's home-school teacher, Rafael worked to establish a regular routine for her, he says — which experts generally endorse as a way to help kids feel more secure while learning and playing. Rafael's double role as dad and teacher helped keep Alisa focused, rather than "[goofing] around too much" — but he was also conscious of the need to avoid overworking her, he says. Alisa frequently rode her scooter to friends' homes in their neighborhood for after-school playdates, and on most Wednesdays, Rafael took her to Disneyland in nearby Anaheim to give her "a release valve" to look forward to each week, he says. She's looking forward to "meeting new people and making new friends" at UC Riverside, traveling around the world and eventually working in the tech industry, possibly running her own startup, she says. Since she's still just 11, Rafael intends to accompany her for most of those plans — chaperoning her travel, and if Alisa launches a startup, he'll likely be her co-founder, she says. She'll live at home and commute to UC Riverside, and Rafael will wait on campus during her classes, which means he's unlikely to return to a full-time day job anytime soon, he adds. "When people ask: 'Are you going back to work?' [I say], 'Yeah, I might slow down and relax and do something like a 9-to-5 again someday.' But, not now," says Rafael.

Article: Arsenal kept Manchester United’s expensively assembled forward line at bay and scored again from a set piece to win 1-0 at Old Trafford in the marquee match in the opening round of English football’s Premier League. Arsenal defender Riccardo Calafiori nodded in from close range in the 13th minute on Sunday after United back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayındır flapped at the ball from a corner whipped in by Declan Rice. The Spaniard was left to depend on his reliable defence and goalkeeper David Raya to secure a huge three points as the visitors never fully got going as an attacking force. United spent around 200 million pounds ($270m) on revamping their attack in the preseason, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha starting the match and Benjamin Sesko coming off the bench in the second half. Advertisement Arsenal had held interest in Sesko for well over a year before instead pursuing a move for Viktor Gyokeres as the solution to their need for a number nine. Hopefully, I play a lot but if not there is another teammate that can play.” Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes said that while his team played well, they need to be more clinical in front of goal.

A month after stunning Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, Chelsea toiled at Stamford Bridge after a short preseason because of the team’s exertions in the United States. Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest hit the ground running with a 3-1 win over Brentford, with striker Chris Wood – the team’s top scorer last season, with 20 goals – netting twice in the first half, on either side of a goal by Dan Ndoye on his debut. All matches on Sunday featured a period of silence before kickoff as a tribute to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, the brothers who were killed in a car crash in Spain last month.

Article: Terence Stamp, British actor who portrayed General Zod in early 'Superman' films, dies at 87 LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. Stamp's six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's "The Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." Stamp also was widely praised for his lead in director Steven Soderbergh's 1999 crime drama "The Limey." But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's "Superman" and its sequel "Superman II" two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker and charming - more human - element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since. That was perhaps most notable in the 1965 adaptation of John Fowles' creepy debut novel "The Collector," where he played the awkward and lonely Freddie Clegg, who kidnapped Samantha Eggar's Miranda Grey in a warped attempt to win her love. "And he said to me, 'You should always study your voice.'" Stamp then segued into a spot-on Olivier impersonation, continuing, "'Because, as you get older, your looks go, but your voice will become empowered.'" Born in London's East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton.

Article: Air Canada suspends restart plans after union defies return to work order toggle caption Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press/AP TORONTO — Air Canada said it suspended plans to restart operations on Sunday after the union representing 10,000 flight attendants said it will defy a return to work order. Air Canada said in a statement that the union "illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board." Sponsor Message "Our members are not going back to work," Canadian Union of Public Employees national president Mark Hancock said outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport. "Air Canada has really refused to bargain with us and they refused to bargain with us because they knew this government would come in on their white horse and try and save the day," he said. The country's largest airline had said early Sunday in a release that the first flights would resume later in the day but that it will take several days before its operations return to normal. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada's prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full "due to the summer travel peak." Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said "would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada." But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.

Steve Witkoff told CNN it was agreed at the Alaska summit that the US and Europe could "effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee", referring to Nato's principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Speaking ahead of his visit to Washington DC, Zelensky said any guarantee "must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe's participation". Meanwhile, following a meeting on Sunday of the "coalition of the willing" - a group of nations including the UK, France and Germany that have pledged to protect peace in Ukraine once it is achieved - a No10 spokesman said leaders had commended Trump's "commitment" to providing security guarantees. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte are set to join Zelensky in Washington on Monday. It comes after Putin reportedly presented Trump with a peace offer in Alaska on Friday that would require Ukraine withdrawing from the Donetsk region of the Donbas, in return for Russia freezing the front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. in under 2 minutes Monday's White House meeting will be Zelensky's first since an acrimonious public exchange in the Oval Office in February, when Trump told him to be more "thankful" for US support and accused him of "gambling with World War Three". Ukraine has also signed a minerals deal that gave the US a financial stake in the country, and Kyiv made it clear they were willing to pay for US arms. The Russian president, who is facing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, stepped off his jet and onto a red carpet to be warmly received by Trump, who later said they had a "fantastic relationship".

Arteta also said his side did not make enough of the chance to play the ball behind the United defence, something that would have shown Gyokeres' qualities, and they missed "seven or eight situations when the ball is completely open to play through" to attack the goal. Gyokeres failed to have a single shot in a league game for the first time since April 2023, when he played for Coventry City against Blackburn Rovers in the Championship, ending a 69-match run.

Aviv Atlas | Reuters Israeli police blasted crowds with water cannons and made dozens of arrests on Sunday as thousands of protesters demanding a deal to free hostages in Gaza aimed to shut down the country with a one-day strike that blocked roads and closed businesses. Groups representing families of hostages organized the demonstrations as frustration grows in Israel over plans for a new military offensive in some of Gaza's most populated areas, which many fear could further endanger the remaining hostages.

Article: LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — After a lackluster campaign overshadowed by a looming economic collapse, Bolivians voted on Sunday for a new president and parliament in elections that could see a right-wing government elected for the first time in over two decades. The vote, which could spell the end of the Andean nation’s long-dominant leftist party, is one of the most consequential for Bolivia in recent times — and one of the most unpredictable. WATCH: Bolivia’s economic turmoil fuels distrust in government and its claim of a failed coup “The economy is a disaster right now, so all I could bring myself to do was vote for change,” said Eileen Mirabal, a 30-year-old psychologist and Doria Medina supporter displaying her ink-stained thumb outside a polling station in the country’s capital of La Paz. Bolivia could follow rightward trend The election marks a watershed moment for the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, whose founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leftist leaders that swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. The outcome will determine whether Bolivia — a nation of 12 million people with the largest lithium reserves on Earth — follows a growing trend in Latin America, where right-wing leaders like Argentina’s libertarian Javier Milei, Ecuador’s strongman Daniel Noboa and El Salvador’s conservative populist Nayib Bukele have surged in popularity. Bolivians bitter as they vote for the ‘lesser evil’ Bolivians waiting to vote at polling stations across La Paz, the country’s capital, expressed confused, cynical and bitter emotions — fed by an annual inflation rate of more than 16%, a scarcity of fuel and absence of hope for swift improvement. “People were waiting for a new, popular candidate, and in this, the opposition failed us,” said Ronaldo Olorio, a 50-year-old farmer from the coca-growing Yungas region and former Morales supporter. But I have to vote for one of the two.” An election day ban on the use of all but authorized vehicles left the normally bustling streets of La Paz and neighboring El Alto deserted on Sunday, reflecting the somber mood. After storming to office in 2006, Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, nationalized the nation’s oil and gas industry, using the profits to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure and improve the lives of the rural poor. After three consecutive presidential terms, as well as a contentious bid for an unprecedented fourth in 2019 that set off popular unrest and led to his ouster, Morales has been barred from this race by Bolivia’s constitutional court. The president of Bolivia’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Oscar Hassenteufel, said Sunday was “proceeding peacefully with some isolated incidents that have not affected the vote.” In one of those incidents, a dynamite stick was tossed outside the polling station where Rodríguez planned to vote, said prosecutor Juan Carlos Campero. The young candidate emerged unscathed, leaving without a word as the crowd shouted, “Get out!” Nearby Morales slipped his null-and-void ballot into the box, surrounded by coca-growing union activists who formed a human chain to protect him from arrest. Conservative candidates say austerity needed Doria Medina and Quiroga have warned of the need for a painful fiscal adjustment, including the elimination of Bolivia’s food and fuel subsidies, to save the nation from insolvency. “Both candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.” If, as is widely expected, no presidential candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct.

Article: NEW YORK — A club shooting in the New York City borough of Brooklyn early Sunday left three people dead and nine others wounded in a year of record low gun violence in the city. At a news briefing, Tisch called the killings “a tragic, senseless act of violence.” The crime is the second mass shooting within weeks in New York City during a year that has otherwise seen declining gun violence. Mayor Eric Adams said both shootings reinforce “why we do this work of going after guns off our streets.” “This is the second within weeks, and we don't want this to turn into a normal course of doing business of violence in our city," he said. “If you were inside the club, if you heard individuals talking about this shooting, if you witnessed someone fleeing the location, every piece of information will allow us to put the puzzle together," Adams said.

Article: LOS ANGELES — “Weapons” scared its way to the top of the box office in its debut and managed to stay there during its second box office weekend, beating out “Freakier Friday” and newcomer “Nobody 2.” Zach Cregger's horror earned $25 million in 3,450 North American theaters, a 43% drop from its first weekend. “August came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,” Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like “Deadpool and Wolverine” and the horror sci-fi “Alien: Romulus” that premiered this time last year. Jim Orr, president of domestic distributions at Universal Pictures, said he hopes the movie's reaction scores — a 89% Audience score and B+ CinemaScore — point “to a long and successful run at the domestic box office.” Another sequel, “The Bad Guys 2,” took fifth place with $7.5 million during its third weekend in theaters.

The largest crowd was seen in Tel Aviv's "Hostages Square" on Sunday, with the organisers saying the government's plans to seize control of Gaza City risked the lives of around 20 hostages still being held by Hamas. Watch: Protesters block Israeli road demanding hostage deal and war end Far-right Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich also denounced the protests, describing them as a "harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas". Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan and a leading figure in the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, said the group demanded "a comprehensive and achievable agreement and an end to the war". The protests came a week after Israel's war cabinet voted to occupy Gaza City, the territory's largest city, and displace its population, in a move condemned by the UN Security Council. Reuters Protesters filled main roads on the way to Hostages Square in Tel Aviv At least 40 people were killed by Israeli attacks across the territory on Saturday, Gaza's civil defence agency said.

"Their presence is focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve," Clapper added. "The DC National Guard remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon." Sponsor Message Earlier this month, President Trump announced that the federal government was assuming control of the Metropolitan Police Department and would deploy hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members to the nation's capital. The Posse Comitatus Act prevents federal armed forces from taking part in civilian law enforcement operations, unless they are "expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress." But National Guard members deployed to U.S. because he said it had been "overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people." In fact, crime data shows that violent crime in the city has dropped 26% compared to last year. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Friday that the city's "limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now." Hundreds of demonstrators protested against the police surge in the city on Saturday. Bell, who was a pastor in Minnesota when unrest erupted following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, said he hoped Black leaders would help the community avoid confrontations with troops and federal agents. "I think we are well equipped to handle this moment." Rosa Brooks, a former Metropolitan Police Department reserve officer who now teaches at Georgetown Law School, voiced alarm at the presence of National Guard troops who are not trained in day-to-day law enforcement on the streets of the capital. "I think what we're seeing is the effort to habituate people to the idea that you're going to have armed federal personnel in your business, asking questions, stopping you, and that's just truly scary," Brooks said. The Republican governors of three states — West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio — said Saturday that they would send National Guard members to Washington to assist the federal forces already in the capital.

Article: Iraqi officials have begun the excavation of what is believed to be a mass grave left behind by ISIL (ISIS) during its years of carnage exacted upon the civilian population after it seized large swaths of the nation from 2014 onwards, until being vanquished three years later. Local authorities were working alongside the judiciary, forensic investigators, the Iraqi Martyrs Foundation and the directorate of mass graves to carry out the excavation in al-Khafsa, south of the northern city of Mosul, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported on Sunday. The site – a sinkhole about 150 metres (nearly 500 feet) deep and 110 metres (360 ft) wide – is believed to have been the grisly scene of some of the worst massacres committed by ISIL. Ahmad Qusay al-Asady, head of the Martyrs Foundation’s mass graves excavation department, told The Associated Press news agency that his team began work on August 9 at the request of the Nineveh province. At its peak, ISIL ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom, spanning across Iraq and Syria, with Raqqa in the latter being the capital of their self-declared “caliphate”. Rabah Nouri Attiyah, a lawyer who has worked on more than 70 cases of missing people in Nineveh, told the AP that information points to al-Khasfa being “the largest mass grave in modern Iraqi history”.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israeli protesters demanding a deal to free hostages in Gaza attempted to shut down the country Sunday in one of the largest and fiercest protests in 22 months of war. “We live between a terrorist organization that holds our children and a government that refuses to release them for political reasons,” said Yehuda Cohen, whose son Nimrod is held in Gaza. “Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas’ position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called Sunday's demonstrations “a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas’ hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.” The new offensive would require the call-up of thousands of reservists, another concern for many Israelis. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the Israeli-backed and U.S.-supported distribution points that have become the main source of aid since they opened in May, said there was no gunfire “at or near” its sites, which are located in military-controlled areas. Israel’s air and ground war has killed more than 61,900 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children. Fears of the coming military offensive It is not clear when Israel's military will begin the new offensive in crowded Gaza City, Muwasi and what Netanyahu has called the “central camps” of Gaza. The military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, this weekend noted plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones to southern Gaza “for their protection.” Designated “safe zones,” however, also have been bombed during the war. “There are no humanitarian zones at all,” said Raghda Abu Dhaher, who said she has been displaced 10 times during the war and now shelters in a school in western Gaza City. Airstrike on power plant in Yemen Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s capital Sunday, escalating strikes on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who since the war in Gaza began have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea.

Article: Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday told “Face the Nation” on CBS that the action came after ”outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it." Rubio said there were “just a small number” of the visas issued to children in need of medical aid but that they were accompanied by adults. As a result, he said, “we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the process of acquiring those visas.” Loomer on Friday posted videos on X of children from Gaza arriving earlier this month in San Francisco and Houston for medical treatment with the aid of an organization called HEAL Palestine. “Despite the US saying we are not accepting Palestinian ‘refugees’ into the United States under the Trump administration,” these people from Gaza were able to travel to the U.S., she said. The State Department on Sunday declined to comment on how many of the visas had been granted and whether the decision to halt visas to people from Gaza had anything to do with Loomer’s posts. The group said it is “an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine." A post on the organization’s Facebook page Thursday shows a photo of a boy from Gaza leaving Egypt and headed to St. The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where Israel's over 22-month war against Hamas has heavily destroyed or damaged much of the territory's health system. “More than 14,800 patients still need lifesaving medical care that is not available in Gaza,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday on social media, and called on more countries to offer support. It noted that before the war in Gaza began, 50 to 100 patients were leaving Gaza daily for medical treatment, and it called for a higher rate of approvals from Israeli authorities. and partners say medicines and even basic health care supplies are low in Gaza after Israel cut off all aid to the territory of over 2 million people for more than 10 weeks earlier this year.

Article: 7 minutes ago Share Save Helen Catt Political correspondent Share Save BBC Warning: This article contains strong language The video opens with some white cliffs and a politician standing on a beach. This isn't about shouting, it isn't about being louder, it's about being more effective." Tried and tested vs a radical approach The Greens had record success at the General Election last summer, going from one to four seats in Parliament and overturning large Labour and Conservative majorities. But his opponents, the current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, who are running on a joint-ticket, believe Polanski would explode a winning formula that has brought them their greatest ever electoral success. Their style is, mostly, less combative - they believe it's important that the Greens have broad appeal and that the party is seen to be at the heart of Westminster if it wants to bring about change. Ellie and Adrian 2025/PA Wire The current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns are running on a joint-ticket Chowns says many voters already have a "generalised warm feeling" towards the Greens, they just need convincing they're a credible option. "What they need to know is that if they put their vote in the Green box on the ballot paper that's got a really, really good chance of electing somebody." Time to capitalise on discontent? Plenty of analysts, and Green party members themselves, have questioned why the party hasn't already capitalised more on left-wing discontent with Labour, or why it hasn't pitched itself more effectively as an alternative to the traditional parties, in the way Reform UK has. Matt Zarb-Cousin, a former spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn who joined the Greens in 2022, is a founding member of Greens Organise, a group that wants the party to take a more socialist stance. Whose side are you on?" Ian Forsyth/Getty Images Ramsay and Chowns have secured endorsement from the former Green MP Caroline Lucas Former Green party councillor Rupert Read, who is an environmental philosopher and a co-director of the campaign group Climate Majority Project, says a lot of Green party policy is left-wing, but adds that this is often the result of "making green policies that work for ordinary people". Ramsay says that Polanski is "about appealing to a narrow base of activists," which he and Chowns argue isn't enough to win in the UK's first past the past electoral system. The Green Peer Baroness Bennett, who led the party between 2012 and 2016, said there had been "a level of excitement and interest around this leadership election more than I've ever seen before by a very large scale". (The cut-off date to join and be able to vote in the leadership contest was July 31.) Baroness Bennett also points to "organic growth in the grassroots" since the general election. The party has held 12 seats in council by-elections since 4 July 2024, and won another 14 - mostly at the expense of Labour, while losing four to the Conservatives. This all marks a significant change from the past - the so-called "Green Surge" in 2015, under Baroness Bennett's leadership, saw the party's membership and vote share grow but still only returned Caroline Lucas to Parliament. Jonathan Brady/PA Wire Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns with Sian Berry and current co-leader Carla Denyer (second left) Prof Neil Carter from the University of York, a long-time observer of environmental politics, says he can see an argument for following Polanski's strategy, as the Greens have traditionally had the greatest success with "metropolitan, liberal-minded, young, professionals". "The trouble is you can reach out to a sort of middle-class Tory rural voter to some extent, if you just talk Green, but as soon as you start to talk about all of those other issues that the Greens like to talk about, you're going to alienate those voters." But Chowns, who, like Ramsay, won a formerly Conservative seat, says that's not her experience. For that reason, Luke Tryl, who is UK director of the political research organisation More in Common, believes that Polanski's approach might be the Greens' quickest route to boosting its numbers. "If you are trying to get 10 to 15%, it's probably what gets you noticed." But he argues it would net the party far fewer seats than the 40 that Polanski believes he can win. Mark Kerrison via Getty Images Polanski calls his approach "eco-populism" and says it's about being "bolder" He says that the party is rarely brought up in the focus groups which he runs outside of Green areas and that a charismatic leader could help the party cut through. Mr Tryl, however, believes that while eco-populism could be a good way of getting known, the Greens would then need to "moderate" to become a "genuine mass movement party with potential for power". On getting into government, he says: "The Adrian and Ellie approach is right because you need to win over more of the North Herefordshires and Waveney Valleys (Chowns' and Ramsay's seats) and actually places like the Isle of Wight - but they are a long way from that". Where Corbyn's new party fits in There is another challenge facing all candidates: the new party that will soon be launched by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, a former Labour MP. Both Prof Carter and Mr Tryl warn that Polanski's strategy could be crowded out by this new party that has yet to be named but which, according to Corbyn, had 600,000 people sign up by early August. The strategy they propose sticking with is based on the one she used to get elected as the first ever Green MP in 2010, and focuses on intensive local campaigning.

Article: in under 2 minutes US President Donald Trump will host Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday for their first meeting since the pair's heated exchange in the White House earlier this year - but this time the Ukrainian president is bringing European allies. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are among leaders who will join Zelensky in Washington for talks on how to end the war with Russia. It follows Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska that resulted in the US president dropping a demand for a ceasefire and calling instead for a permanent peace deal. Also heading to Washington for Monday's meeting are French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. What handing Donbas to Putin would mean for Ukraine Washington talks could prove more vital than Trump-Putin summit In maps: War-ravaged Ukrainian territories For so many heads of state to travel with such little notice across the Atlantic to what is essentially a wartime crisis meeting appears without precedent in the modern era, underscoring the sky-high stakes. Diplomatic sources say European officials are concerned that Trump may try to press Zelensky to agree to terms, after the Ukrainian leader was excluded from the Trump-Putin meeting on US soil last Friday. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the BBC's US partner CBS that any suggestion Zelensky might be bullied by Trump into accepting a peace deal was a "stupid media narrative". February's row between Zelensky, Vance and Trump Nato leaders also appear eager to avoid a repeat of Zelensky's February trip to the Oval Office that ended abruptly after an argument with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. In April, Ukraine signed a minerals agreement that gave the US a financial stake in the country, and Trump and Zelensky spoke privately at the Vatican before Pope Francis's funeral.

Article: Washington talks could prove more vital for Ukraine's future than Trump-Putin summit 58 minutes ago Share Save Frank Gardner BBC Security Correspondent Share Save Getty Images It is quite possible that Monday's meeting in the White House could prove even more crucial to the future of Ukraine - and for all of Europe's security - than last Friday's US-Russia summit in Alaska. The presence of Sir Keir Starmer, President Macron, Chancellor Merz and other leaders alongside President Zelensky in Washington is about more than making sure he does not get ambushed in the Oval Office again, in the way he did on 28 February. They are determined to impress upon Donald Trump two things: firstly, that there can be no peace deal for Ukraine without Ukraine's direct involvement and secondly, that it must be backed by 'cast-iron' security guarantees. Above all, Europe's leaders want the US President to see that Ukraine and Europe present a united front and they are eager to ensure he is not being swayed by his obvious personal rapport with Vladimir Putin into giving in to the Russian leaders' demands. The US President appears to be less fond of President Macron and the White House was sharply critical recently of his intention to unconditionally recognise a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly. European leaders have said frequently that international borders cannot be changed by force and President Zelensky has said time and time again he will not give up land and besides, Ukraine's constitution forbids it. Yet as the former Estonian PM and now Europe's top diplomat Kaja Kallas once said to me: victory for Ukraine in this war does not have to be exclusively about reconquering occupied land. If Ukraine can obtain the sort of Article 5-type security guarantees now being talked about, sufficient to deter any future Russian aggression and thereby safeguard its independence as a free and sovereign state, then that would be a form of victory. It does now appear that what the US and Russia have been discussing is a proposal that broadly trades some Ukrainian land for security guarantees that it won't have to give up any more to Russia. If it is asked to give up the remaining 30 per cent of Donetsk Oblast that Russia has yet to occupy then does that leave the path westwards to Kyiv dangerously under-defended?

It shone a spotlight on wildly differing interpretations of both the country's struggle for independence in the 1990s, and the history of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War Two-era Nazi puppet state. Reuters Marko Perkovic, known as Thompson, led the crowd in a chant which many claim has roots in the Nazi-era Ustasha organisation This chant has outraged opposition parties and organisations working for human rights and ethnic and regional reconciliation. They point out that "Za dom, spremni" originated with the anti-Semitic, Nazi-allied Ustasha organization during World War Two – and that Croatia's Constitutional Court has ruled that the phrase "is an Ustasha salute of the Independent State of Croatia [which is] not in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia". "This has opened Pandora's box," says Tena Banjeglav of Documenta – Centre for Dealing with the Past, an organisation which focuses on reconciliation by taking a factual approach to both World War Two and the more recent war of independence. Tena Banjeglav says that Thompson's concert has opened a Pandora's box of nationalism Conservative commentator Matija Štahan believes that Thompson's time serving as a soldier during the war of independence gives him the right to use "Za dom, spremni" in his work. "Many journalists in the West say it's the Croatian version of 'Heil Hitler' – but it would be best to describe it as the Croatian version of [the Ukrainian national salute] 'Slava Ukraini'. Young people want to shout it as something that's subversive." This interpretation cuts no ice with the Youth Initiative for Human Rights (YIHR), a regional organisation which works for reconciliation among the younger generations in the Western Balkans. It identifies with the losing side in World War Two, doesn't recognise it waged an unjust war in Bosnia and refuses to acknowledge systematic crimes against Serbs."

Article: New wave of African pride rises in the Caribbean 30 minutes ago Share Save Wedaeli Chibelushi BBC News Gemma Handy BBC News in St John's Share Save EPA Trinidad and Tobago pays tribute to the nation's Afro-descendant community on Emancipation Day, which marks the ending of slavery throughout the British Empire Augustine Ogbo works as a doctor, treating patients in clinics across the striking Caribbean island of St Lucia. When he returns to his home in the coastal town of Rodney Bay, he clocks in for his second job - as the owner and solo chef of a Nigerian takeaway. So most of the time, they want to get in touch with that," Dr Ogbo explains, adding that interest in African culture has grown "tremendously" since he arrived almost a decade ago. People across the Caribbean have been expressing African pride through cultural means, such as food, clothing and travel, while governments and institutions from both sides of the Atlantic have been meeting to forge economic ties. A significant part of the islands' population descended from enslaved West and Central Africans, who were forcibly transported to the Caribbean by European merchants in the 17th and 18th Centuries. "It was particularly strong in the 1930s or so, and then again in the 1960s - we saw a major outpouring in sync with the [American] black power movement during that period," he says, talking to the BBC on the island of Antigua. Mr O'Marde believes the Caribbean is witnessing a renewed, more promising version of such "pan-Africanism" (a term used to describe the idea that people of African descent should be unified). "We are in a different phase now of pan-Africanism – one that's not going to wane like before." EPA/Shutterstock The cultural ties are strong but new trends on social media, as well as African musicians going global, have excited a new generation One thing that separates this wave of African pride from the ones that came before is social media. Dennis Howard, an entertainment and cultural enterprise lecturer at the University of the West Indies, says a "significant" amount of Jamaicans are connecting with Africa through platforms such as TikTok. the music is changing that." Asked about the view of some Jamaican commenters online - that islanders do not need to reclaim their African heritage as they have an equally valid, hard-won Jamaican heritage of their own - Mr Howard stresses that the two are not distinct. The tourism authority in Ghana - once a major departure point for enslaved Africans being shipped to the Caribbean - told the BBC there had been a "notable increase" in holidaymakers from the islands in recent years. Similarly, Werner Gruner, South Africa's consul to the Bahamas, says that over the past two or three years, his office has seen a rise in local people travelling to South Africa, Ghana and Kenya. "I see a lot of interest in safaris and I think people also start to realise that South Africa and other African countries are actually very well developed," Mr Gruner says. EPA Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar (second from the right) wore a Nigeria-inspired outfit when she met African dignitaries on Emancipation Day Even Burkina Faso, an economically struggling country under military rule that is not well known for tourism, is apparently on some people's buckets lists. Earlier this year, in a speech in which she referred to herself as a "daughter of Africa", Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley called for the construction of "air and sea bridges" between Africa and the Caribbean. Key institutions like the African Union, African Development Bank (AfDB) and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) have been working on the "trade" angle, hosting conferences and setting up memorandums of understanding with their Caribbean counterparts. But at the moment, Africa and the Caribbean have some of the lowest indicators in the world for transport infrastructure, logistics quality and customs efficiency, according to the World Bank. Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis told delegates at an Afreximbank meeting in Nigeria they should "seriously" consider a single digital currency, while Grenada's Dickon Mitchell said: "Such a move would symbolically and practically affirm our shared identity not just as trading partners, but as members of a truly global Africa". Getting more than 60 countries to coordinate and launch a standard system would be no easy feat, but Mitchell said this must be done if the regions are to "take control of [their] own future". Back in St Lucia, Dr Ogbo says his attempts to bring egusi, fufu and jollof to local people are a small but worthy contribution to the strengthening of relations between Africa and the Caribbean. The doctor and businessman is now trying to upgrade his food business to a full-fledged restaurant - and he hopes the "cultural exchange" between Africa and the Caribbean also goes from strength to strength.

Article: Gavin Newsom filed a request Sunday seeking records from the Trump administration to explain why a phalanx of Border Patrol agents showed up outside a news conference held by leading California Democrats last week. At the news conference, Newsom announced a campaign to seek voter approval to redraw California’s congressional maps to boost Democrats’ chances of retaking the House and stymieing Trump’s agenda in the 2026 midterm elections. “This is an attempt to advance a playbook from the despots he admires in Russia and North Korea.” Advertisement Newsom announced at the press event the “Election Rigging Response Act” — which would scrap independently drawn congressional maps in favor of those sketched by Democratic strategists in an attempt to counter moves by Republicans in Texas and other GOP-led states to gerrymander their own districts to favor Republicans in the 2026 midterms. In response to questions from The Times on Sunday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the agents were “focused on enforcing the law, not on [Newsom].” McLaughlin said two people were arrested during the Little Tokyo operation. One was a drug trafficker, according to McLaughlin, who said the other was a member of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that has been a focus of the Trump administration’s efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportation efforts. “Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.” Advertisement On Thursday, witnesses at the scene identified one of the men arrested as Angel, a delivery worker who was carrying strawberries when he was captured. “It’s pretty sad, because I’ve got to go to work tomorrow, and Angel isn’t going to be there.” In the FOIA request, Newsom’s legal affairs secretary, David Sapp, called the Border Patrol deployment an “attempt to intimidate the people of California from defending a fair electoral process.” In addition to documents related to the planning of the raid, the FOIA request also seeks “any records referencing Governor Newsom or the rally that was scheduled to occur” and communications between federal law enforcement officials and Fox News, which allowed the Trump-friendly media outlet to embed a reporter with Border Patrol that day. Just last week, Trump sent swarms of federal law enforcement officials to Washington, D.C., to combat what he sees as out-of-control crime, despite the fact that most crime statistics show violence in the nation’s capital is at a 30-year low. The new maps, drawn by Democratic strategists and lawmakers behind closed doors instead of the independent commission that voters previously chose, would concentrate Republican voters in a few deep-red pockets of the state and eliminate an Inland Empire district long held by the GOP. In total, Democrats would likely pick up five seats in California in the midterms under the redrawn maps, possibly countering or outpacing Republican efforts to tilt their map red in Texas. Other states have already begun to consider redrawing their maps along more partisan lines in response to growing anxieties over the fight to control the House of Representatives in 2026.

Article: James Bond 'has to be a guy', says Helen Mirren 2 hours ago Share Save Tabby Wilson BBC News Share Save Getty Images Dame Helen Mirren has said James Bond should be played by a man, even though she is "such a feminist". Amazon MGM Studios will produce the next iteration of the spy franchise, with Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight set to write what will become the 26th film in the series. The 80-year-old is currently starring opposite former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan in the much anticipated film adaption of The Thursday Murder Club, in which she plays a retired spy. Brosnan, 72, also told the magazine that he believed a male actor should continue to play Bond and he was excited to "see a whole new exuberance and life for this character." He starred in four Bond films during his tenure as 007, starting with GoldenEye in 1995 and finishing with Die Another Day, which was released in 2002. Mirren has previously been quoted saying that the concept of James Bond was "born out of profound sexism", and that women have always been an "incredibly important part" of the Secret Service. Mirren and Brosnan are not the first to push back on the idea of Bond being played by a woman, with the sentiment echoed by Brosnan's Die Another Day costar, Halle Berry. "In 2025, it's nice to say, 'Oh, she should be a woman.' But, I don't really know if I think that's the right thing to do," she said, speaking at Cannes Film Festival in May.

Article: Terence Stamp, '60s British film legend and star of 'Superman,' dies at 87 toggle caption Sonia Recchia/Getty Images Terence Stamp, the British heartthrob whose performance as the arch-villain in early Superman films and as the title role in Billy Budd won critical praise, died on Sunday. Often associated with the Swinging '60s, Stamp became a sought-after actor for both his distinctive good looks and the versatility of his performances, portraying everything from a humble sailor to shadow-haunted super-villains. Writing in 1994, when the film was released, critic Roger Ebert said : "At the beginning of the film we're distracted by the unexpected sight of Terence Stamp in drag, but Stamp is able to bring a convincing humanity to the character." Stamp once said about playing the drag queen: "I was incredibly frightened about it — it's not anything I have ever done, but I happened to be having an afternoon tea with a fellow actress who was a very wise woman and she was flicking through my script and told me to do it." It grossed $16 million in the Australian box office, notched the Oscar for best costume design and became one of the generation's most iconic Australian films. Born in East London, the son of a tugboat worker and a homemaker, Stamp has said his working-class background set him apart from other actors, who at the time mostly came from more affluent upbringings. He dabbled in other fields, including advertising, and a stint working in a hospital, before he began doing theater in England — against the advice of his father and counselors at schools. Sponsor Message Stamp has said after his father came back from World War II, he was a "very emotionally closed down guy," but credits his mother with supporting his drive to become an actor, noting in his memoir that she was an "inveterate moviegoer." toggle caption Roger Jackson/Getty Images/Hulton Archive At 24, Stamp landed his breakout role with Billy Budd, adapted from a Herman Melville novel, where critics noted that his "sinewy, boyish frame and the face of a Botticelli angel" made him the perfect lead-role sailor. That all changed, he later wrote in his memoir, when he received a telegram to a hotel in India that asked him to return to London to be in the Superman movies.

The country's state of Johor — with a population of about 4 million people — has attracted billions' worth of projects for such data centers in recent years , including from many of the world's largest technology firms, such as Google , Microsoft and China's ByteDance . Energy needs and hurdles While Johor currently has about 580 megawatts (MW) of data center capacity, its total planned capacity — including early-stage projects — is nearly 10 times that amount, according to figures provided by data center market intelligence firm DC Byte. Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, a Malaysian independent investment bank, has projected that the electricity use of the country's data centers will equate to 20% of its total energy-generating capacity by 2035. In the face of those growing demands, a Malaysian industry official told reporters in June that the country expects to add 6 to 8 gigawatts of gas-fired power, with total power consumption on track to increase 30% by 2030. Though the natural gas used in these power stations burns cleaner than coal — which accounted for more than 43% of Malaysia's electricity in 2023 — reliance on it for future data center expansion could clash with the country's plan to achieve net-zero emissions as early as 2050. It's therefore no surprise that Johor, which has experienced several supply disruptions and already relies on neighboring Singapore for a sizeable amount of its treated water, is reportedly in the process of building three new reservoirs and water treatment plants. Global picture Data centers are the backbone of the digital world, hosting the information and computing resources that power everything from e-commerce to social media to digital banking, and increasingly, generative AI models. Demand and investor appetite for such centers have never been higher, given the massive computing power needs of AI , with Johor serving as just one example of the industry's growth and the energy and water challenges that come with it. According to a May report by the International Monetary Fund, electricity used by the world's data centers had already reached the levels of Germany and France in 2023, soon after the launch of OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT AI model. President Donald Trump recently launched " America's AI Action Plan ," calling for streamlined permitting and the removal of environmental regulations to speed up the development of AI infrastructure and the energy needed to power it. A June analysis from Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University projected that by 2030, Americans' electricity bills are on track to rise 8% and greenhouse gas emissions from power generation 30% as a result of growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining. "There are no unavoidable AI uses, and whether we move towards net-zero emissions is a choice," Jonathan Koomey , a leading independent researcher on the energy and environmental effects of information technology, told CNBC in an email.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has increased pressure on Ukraine to accept an agreement to end Russia’s war, claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could choose to end the conflict “almost immediately”. Addressing Zelenskyy a day before his high-stakes visit to the White House on Monday, Trump warned that the return of Russian-occupied Crimea and Ukrainian membership of NATO would be off the table in any negotiated settlement. “President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday. Some things never change!!!” Trump’s comments came as European leaders were set to accompany Zelenskyy on his visit to Washington, DC, on Monday amid concerns in Brussels and Kyiv that the US president could sign off on a deal that is overly favourable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East – part of Donbas – and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack. Or when Ukraine was given so called ‘security guarantees’ in 1994, but they didn’t work.” Advertisement Zelenskyy added that Crimea “should not have been given up then, just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022”. While Trump has indicated that a deal with Moscow would involve “some swapping, changes in land” between Russia and Ukraine, Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to “the occupier”. In a bid to press Trump to maintain support for Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni are attending Monday’s talks at the White House. Despite Trump dismissing the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said earlier on Sunday that Putin had agreed to support a US-backed security guarantee resembling the 32-member transatlantic alliance’s collective defence mandate during last week’s meeting with the US president in Alaska. “We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,” Witkoff told CNN’s State of the Union.

Article: Bolivia is heading to a presidential run-off between a centrist and right-wing candidate, confirming the end of two decades of government by the Movement for Socialism (MAS), according to the South American country’s electoral council. With more than 91 percent of the ballots counted on Sunday night, preliminary results showed centrist Rodrigo Paz of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) in the lead, with 32.8 percent of the vote. Conservative former interim President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, of the Alianza Libre coalition, was in second place, with 26.4 percent of the vote, meaning he will face Paz, the son of former left-leaning President Jaime Paz, in a run-off election on October 19. Al Jazeera’s Latin America editor Lucia Newman, reporting from Bolivia’s Santa Cruz de la Sierra, said the early results confirmed that MAS, which has governed the country since 2005, is “out of the picture”. Pre-election polls had shown Samuel Doria Medina, a wealthy businessman and former planning minister, as one of two frontrunners alongside Quiroga, who served as interim president and vice president under former military leader President Hugo Banzer. Spiralling inflation The Andean country has been struggling through its worst economic crisis in a generation, marked by annual inflation of almost 25 percent and critical shortages of US dollars and fuel. Bolivia enjoyed more than a decade of strong growth and Indigenous upliftment under Morales, who nationalised the gas sector and ploughed the proceeds into social programmes that halved extreme poverty during his stint in power between 2006 and 2019. But a lack of new gas projects under Morales, who was outspoken on environmental issues and climate change, has seen gas revenues plummet from a peak of $6.1bn in 2013 to $1.6bn last year.

Article: Judge to weigh detainees' legal rights at 'Alligator Alcatraz' in Florida Everglades MIAMI -- A federal judge will hear arguments Monday over whether detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades have been denied their legal rights. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don't have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. "The situation at 'Alligator Alcatraz' is so anomalous from what is typically granted at other immigration facilities," Eunice Cho, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said Thursday during a virtual meeting to prepare for Monday's hearing in Miami. But before delving into the core issues of the detainees' rights, Ruiz has said he wants to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district. "I think we should all be prepared that, before we get into any real argument about preliminary injunctive relief, that we at least spend some time working through the venue issues," Ruiz said Thursday. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: First group Gaza children to be brought to UK 'in coming weeks' More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the start of the war, according to the UN charity Unicef It comes after some MPs wrote a letter to the government urging them to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK "without delay". They would be the first children brought to the UK for treatment as part of a government operation being coordinated by the Foreign Office, Home Office and Department of Health. A group of between 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children will be evacuated from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment in the coming weeks, the BBC understands. In a letter last week, a cross-party group of 96 MPs warned that children were at risk of imminent death due to the "decimation" of the healthcare system in Gaza and any barriers to evacuation should be immediately lifted. Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by the organisation Project Pure Hope (PPH), but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict. Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory. The UN has warned of widespread malnutrition in Gaza, with experts backed by the organisation warning in a report last month that the "worst-case scenario" of famine is playing out in Gaza. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: I saw a kaleidoscopic light before going blind, says survivor of Laos methanol poisoning 27 minutes ago Share Save Oli Constable, Katie Roberts and George Sandeman BBC News Share Save When Calum Macdonald arrived at the Vietnamese border, he couldn't read the administrative forms in front of him. Free shots and beer buckets in party town at centre of methanol deaths 'Don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning' "[We agreed] it was strange but we thought it was food poisoning and the light I was seeing was some kind of sensitivity," he tells BBC Breakfast. Calum was travelling in South East Asia before suffering methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng, Laos Calum is now working with the families of three other British people who died following methanol poisoning in South East Asia. Sue booked a flight immediately but, before she could take off, she received another call in the middle of the night from a doctor in Laos who was treating Simone. "[He said] you need to give permission for urgent brain surgery or she's not going to survive… "I flew out the next day knowing she was going through surgery and I expected the worst, to be honest." The 28-year-old died in hospital from methanol poisoning. "Nothing is going to bring Simone back." Simone messaged her mother before she died saying this was the best holiday she'd ever been on Methanol is a type of alcohol commonly found in cleaning products, fuel and antifreeze. Kirsty, who had lived in Bali for eight years, also fell victim to methanol poisoning Kirsty McKie, 38, died in 2022 but it was not the result of accepting free shots. She had been enjoying drinks at home with a friend ahead of a night out in Bali - the Indonesian island where she had been living and working for eight years. "That's probably been the hardest part for me, not knowing why you live and somebody else dies… It doesn't seem to have any rhyme or reason as to why." On Sumatra, another Indonesian island, Cheznye Emmons died after drinking gin that was later found to contain 66,000 times the legal limit for methanol in drinks. Cheznye died after drinking gin that contained 66,000 times the legal limit for methanol in a drink Cheznye's mother Pamela tells the BBC: "I think the worst part about that… [was] just before she started having a fit, when she first arrived at the hospital, she said to her boyfriend: 'I'm really, really scared.' "And that was basically the last time [she spoke]." Calum's advice to tourists is to avoid free drinks and spirits in general. "There are lots of lovely beers in south-east Asia, which I'm sure people would really enjoy." He says learning of the deaths of the two Danish girls he met in Vang Vieng changed his perspective about his blindness.

Article: Pakistan defends flood response after over 270 people killed in northwestern district toggle caption Muhammad Sajjad/AP BUNER, Pakistan — Rescuers recovered dozens more bodies from the rubble of collapsed homes in a northwestern district of Pakistan, bringing the death toll to at least 274, as authorities defended their response to the flooding and said they did not need any foreign help at this point. Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for Pakistan's emergency service, said 54 bodies were found in Buner, a mountainous area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where torrential rains and cloudbursts triggered massive flooding on Friday. Warnings of more intense rain to come Residents in Buner have accused officials of failing to warn them to evacuate after torrential rain and cloudbursts triggered deadly flooding and landslides. Asfandyar Khan Khattak, director-general of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said there was "no forecasting system anywhere in the world" that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst, a sudden and intense downpour. "If people had been informed earlier, lives could have been saved and residents could have moved to safer places." toggle caption Muhammad Sajjad/AP People still missing Idrees Mahsud, a disaster management official, said Pakistan's early warning system used satellite imagery and meteorological data to send alerts to local authorities. An emergency services spokesman in Buner, Mohammad Sohail, said more than half the damaged roads in the district had reopened by Sunday, allowing vehicles and heavy machinery to reach cut-off villages. In one of the deadliest incidents, 24 people from one family died in the village of Qadar Nagar when floodwaters swept through their home on the eve of a wedding. The country also suffers regular flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September, particularly in the rugged northwest, where villages are often perched on steep slopes and riverbanks. Khalid Khan, a weather expert, said Pakistan produces less than 1% of planet-warming emissions but faces heatwaves, heavy rains, glacial outburst floods and now cloudbursts, underscoring how climate change is devastating communities within hours.

Article: Bolivia's presidential vote goes to runoff between centrist and right-wing candidates toggle caption Freddy Barragan, Arnulfo Franco/AP LA PAZ, Bolivia — Bolivia's presidential vote headed to an unprecedented runoff after a vote Sunday that ended more than two decades of left-wing dominance in the Andean nation but signaled voters' trepidation about a major lurch to the right. Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition's push for tough austerity to rescue Bolivia from economic collapse, will face off against right-wing former President Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga, who finished second. "It's a historic night." A leftist establishment confronts its demise The results delivered a major blow to Bolivia's hegemonic Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed Bolivia almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the "pink tide" of leftist leaders that swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country's Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs and infrastructure. A centrist takes a surprise lead The win for Paz came as a shock to a nation that had been conditioned by weeks of opinion polls to expect that the leading right-wing contenders, Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina, would capture the top two spots. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia's abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. Bolivians associate them both with the U.S.-backed neoliberal administrations that Morales repudiated when he stormed to office in 2006, famously declaring an end to Bolivia's 20-year experiment with free-market capitalism.

Article: France's TotalEnergies said it expects LNG volumes managed by the company to grow by 50% between 2023 and 2030, while BP , which recently doubled down on fossil fuels as part of a green strategy U-turn , has significant LNG investments. Stateside, Exxon Mobil is seeking to double its LNG portfolio by 2030, Chevron has been expanding existing LNG projects and developing new facilities, while Baker Hughes recently said it would buy Chart Industries for $13.6 billion as part of a move to increase its LNG exposure. Electricity and data analyst at Ember Euan Graham LNG is derived from natural gas, a fossil fuel, although it is often presented as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels, like coal and oil. Speaking to CNBC during earnings season, Shell CEO Wael Sawan said the company will need to keep an open mind through the energy transition, noting that this shift "will not be linear." Sawan singled out LNG as one "much sought-after energy form" that will play an integral role in the firm's long-term strategy, alongside plans to build out some of its low carbon projects. "But to the heart of your question, where can Shell predominantly play, I'd say first and foremost it's in LNG," Sawan told CNBC's " Squawk Box Europe " on July 31. "Here is a versatile fuel that is able today to respond to droughts a few years ago in Brazil, respond to the needs of Europe after the Russia invasion of Ukraine, respond to the needs of Asia when you have a hot summer or a very cold winter — and one that is going to grow by 60% between now and 2040." Shell's bullish LNG outlook largely stems from projected economic growth in Asia, which represents the biggest market for LNG, emissions reductions in heavy industry and transport and the impact of an artificial intelligence boom . 'Something has to give' The world's leading global energy watchdog said recently that global demand is expected to pick up next year, following a slowdown in 2025, as more supply comes to market. The IEA has upwardly revised its forecast for LNG, saying that it expects demand to grow at 2.5% per year through to 2035 under a scenario of announced energy and climate policies. "The bottom line is it is a very risky bet — and a bet against the energy transition," Euan Graham, electricity and data analyst at energy think tank Ember, told CNBC by telephone. The rapid rise of solar power , in particular, appears to be undercutting global LNG demand, Graham said, noting that the scale of renewables growth has "completely changed the game." "Geopolitical tensions have also laid bare the risks of relying on fossil fuels, with some countries in Asia uniquely exposed," Graham said. For Shell, Carulli said the focus on LNG represents a "natural continuation" of a business it effectively created from scratch several decades ago, thus providing the London-listed firm with a "competitive advantage" over its industry peers.

Article: A court ordered Australia's largest airline, Qantas Airways , on Monday to pay a record fine of A$90 million ($58.64 million) for illegally sacking 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and criticized it for a lack of contrition. In imposing the penalty, the largest ordered by a court on a company in the history of Australia's labor laws, Federal Court Judge Michael Lee also inveighed against the airline's litigation strategy. While Qantas made changes to its board and management team, Lee said subsequent expressions of regret seemed more aligned with "the damage" the case had done to the company than remorse for the harm caused to workers. Lee said the size of the penalty, about 75% of the maximum he could have set, was important to ensure it "could not be perceived as anything like the cost of doing business". that had shown itself to be ruthless, and we won." Monday's decision follows a December agreement on a compensation fund of A$120 million struck by the airline and the sacked workers. Qantas said it was a commercial decision, but the Federal Court in 2021 held the move to be "adverse action", preventing staff from exercising their workplace rights and unionising, in breach of Australia's Fair Work Act. "It is one thing for the 'Qantas News Room' to issue press releases by a CEO saying sorry; it is quite another for written assertions of contrition, recognition of wrong and cultural change to be tested in a courtroom," Lee said. "It signals a message to employers that if they break the law, then trade unions may receive those penalties in order to assist them in enforcing the act." Qantas said it would pay the fine as ordered.

Article: WASHINGTON — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon at the White House, just days after Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin left an Alaska summit without a ceasefire deal. At the same time, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' “Meet the Press” that a ceasefire was “not off the table,” though Russia has not agreed to stop fighting. In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump appeared to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, while emphasizing that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and its hopes of joining NATO — a key demand from Putin. A day earlier, Trump indicated in a post on Saturday that if talks with Zelenskyy are successful on Monday, he will facilitate further discussions with Putin in hopes of reaching a permanent end to the war. Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. Trump has floated land “swapping,” but the official said that their belief was that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls. He emphasized that "Russia must end this war, which it itself started." The Ukrainian president’s visit will be his first to the White House since a February meeting devolved into a stunning confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. The moment, which played out live on television, shocked Ukrainian allies and marked a sharp shift in the United States’ years-long support for an ally embroiled in a bloody war that began with Russia’s invasion. Trump announced his meeting with Zelenskyy in the early hours of Saturday morning, adding in a post to Truth Social that “if all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin.” The future of major sticking points in discussions to end the war — the status of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and security guarantees to prevent a future Russian invasion — remained murky over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that there “have to be some security guarantees for Ukraine,” noting that the issue would be discussed “over the next few days.” Witkoff said Sunday that security guarantees could resemble NATO’s Article 5, which triggers a response by the entire coalition if one member is attacked. In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Witkoff said that “the United States is potentially prepared to be able to give Article 5 security guarantees, but not from NATO, directly from the United States and other European countries.” The Ukrainian president celebrated what he called “a historic decision” for the U.S. to participate in security guarantees, saying in a post to X on Sunday that they “must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation.” Zelenskyy will also have the opportunity during Monday’s meeting to address Trump’s comments on the future of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia. In the days ahead of the Alaska summit, Trump said that an end to the war would include “some swapping of territories.” Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Rubio said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that “no one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,” referring to land occupied by Russia. But later that morning, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio’s remarks when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, “Ukraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!” Trump left his meeting with Putin without announcing any ceasefire or peace agreements. However, Rubio said Sunday on "Meet the Press" that he did not believe “new sanctions on Russia are going to force him to accept the ceasefire.” Witkoff defended the president after he failed to secure a ceasefire, saying on “Fox News Sunday” that a ceasefire often precedes a peace deal, and “the president has always talked about a ceasefire until he made a lot of different wins in this meeting and began to realize that we could be talking about a peace deal.” “The ultimate deal here is a peace deal,” Witkoff added. Trump’s Friday meeting with Putin was a stark contrast from Zelenskyy’s February trip to the White House, when Trump and Vance publicly berated Zelenskyy, arguing he was not grateful enough for U.S.

Article: Broccoli harvest hit by heatwave and lack of water 7 hours ago Share Save Malcolm Prior and Jenny Kumah BBC News rural affairs team Share Save BBC/Malcolm Prior Some farmers in the driest parts of the UK are finding their broccoli yields are down more than half Farmers in the driest parts of the UK are facing some of their worst ever harvests as the heatwave continues to hit crop and vegetable yields. Broccoli growers are particularly struggling with a lack of water and bone-dry soils, with yields cut by more than 50%, quality affected and shoppers warned to expect smaller vegetables on the shelves. The British Growers Association said supplies of brassicas – including broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage - were "tight" but better harvests in wetter parts of the UK should ensure vegetables still make it to the supermarkets. Getty Images Broccoli farmers in the cooler, wetter parts of the UK are seeing better harvests The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), an independent think tank, is now warning that the UK is on course to see its sixth or seventh worst harvest since records began 40 years ago. Ben Andrews, who has a mixed organic farm growing broccoli near Leominster, Herefordshire, told the BBC that shoppers will have to "shift their expectations" about the size and shape of the vegetables in supermarkets. BBC/Malcolm Prior Martin Williams says he is now reconsidering what he grows thanks to a "devastatingly dry" season The British Growers Association (BGA) said this summer was "proving to be yet another climatic challenge for growers", but shortfalls from some suppliers were being mitigated by producers growing more crops in areas that have seen lower temperatures and higher rainfall. "At this stage, we are confident that the crops will be there, but the weather events of the last three months highlight the increasing uncertainty around our food supplies." Meanwhile, arable farmer Martin Williams, who is also the chairman of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) Herefordshire branch, said he had seen a 50% drop in his cereal yield, a third of the normal potato crop was likely, and there had been a 70% drop in the grass grown for feed.

Article: President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday called on India to stop buying Russian crude oil, accusing the Asian giant of undermining international efforts to isolate Vladimir Putin's war economy. Writing in in the Financial Times, Navarro described India's dependence on Russian oil as "opportunistic," adding that if India "wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the US, it needs to start acting like one." "In effect, India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs," Navarro said in the op-ed. Earlier this month, the Trump administration said it planned to impose an additional 25% tariff on India over Russian oil purchases, bringing the total levies against the country to 50%. India described the move as "extremely unfortunate" at the time, saying the tariffs were "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable." The White House has since warned that secondary levies on India could increase further, depending on the outcome of Trump's peace talks with Putin.

Article: While that might sound like a pretty straightforward situation by “AITA?” Reddit post standards, the escalating standoff between Air Canada and flight attendants striking over their compensation involves knotty issues in business, government, and society. Within 12 hours, Labor Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the strikers to resume work by invoking Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code: That controversial law says the government can end a strike to “maintain or secure industrial peace.” Hajdu said in a statement, “In a year in which Canadian families and businesses have already experienced too much disruption and uncertainty, this is not the time to add additional challenges and disruptions to their lives and our economy.” In response, Air Canada said it was ordered to resume flights at 2pm ET on Sunday. CUPE claimed “a staggering conflict of interest” in the decision: The chair of the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which formally ordered the Air Canada flight attendants back to work, is Maryse Tremblay, Air Canada’s general counsel from 1998 to 2004. CUPE said in a statement that it believed Air Canada walked away from negotiations because it “anticipated government intervention” and “opted to suspend meaningful discussions, contrary to its legal obligation to bargain in good faith.” Now what?

Article: White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says India’s purchases of Russian crude oil are funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine and have to stop, as Washington ramps up pressure on New Delhi to cut off its energy imports from Russia. “India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,” Navarro wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times on Monday. In a speech on the occasion of India’s Independence Day on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi struck a defiant note, pledging to protect his country’s farmers in the face of high tariffs slapped by the Trump administration. Advertisement The US also saw India as a bulwark against rising China, but the recent actions by the Trump administration seem to have pushed India to mend ties with its rival, China. Indian Prime Minister Modi is set to travel to China at the end of the month, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is arriving in India on Monday on a two-day trip, for talks on the disputed border between the two countries. ‘Unfairly singled out’ India’s Foreign Ministry has said the country is being ‘unfairly’ singled out for buying Russian oil while the US and European Union continue to buy goods from Russia. The EU and US trade much more with Russia than India does – New Delhi’s contention for being singled out – although this trade has dipped significantly since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The bloc also continues to buy Russian gas – $105.6bn for gas imports since the war began – an amount equivalent to 75 percent of Russia’s 2024 military budget, according to the Finnish think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. India and the US have also been haggling for months to agree on a free trade agreement, with Trump accusing New Delhi of denying access to US goods by imposing high tariffs. Meanwhile, a planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25 to 29 has been called off, a source told the Reuters news agency, delaying talks on a proposed trade agreement meant to be a relief from additional US tariffs on Indian goods.

Article: Officially known as the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, the conference is not home to formal interest rate policy decisions, but it can be a place where the Fed's leader hints that changes could be coming soon. "The time has come for policy to adjust," Powell said, and a few weeks later, the Fed issued the first of three rate cuts that brought its benchmark lending rate down by one percentage point by year-end. Instead, some experts, including economists at Wells Fargo, expect it to be primarily about providing an update on the Fed's broader monetary policy framework review — a process undertaken every five years. When it was completed in 2020, the Fed announced a new approach to ensuring price stability that would allow for inflation to run moderately above its 2% target if the preceding years saw inflation undershooting its goal. And while inflation has come down from the four-decade highs seen in 2022, it's still running well above 2%, and the Fed is worried that tariffs could add to the inflationary pressures. Accordingly, Wells Fargo expects that Powell will declare that the Fed's policymaking arm is "moving to a framework that will hold up more robustly to varied macroeconomic environments," eschewing the flexible average targeting in favor of "something similar to the previous model of a simple 2% inflation target." Wells Fargo said Powell may also provide updates on the Fed's approach to achieving maximum employment, the other side of its dual mandate. As for the actual results, Wells Fargo expects Palo Alto to report a solid quarter but expressed some concern about what management's fiscal 2026 guidance — specifically for the key metrics of remaining performance obligation (RPO) and annual recurring revenue (ARR) — could have in store.

Article: Joining him will be several key European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron and the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, in what is being seen as a united front to prevent Trump from pressuring Zelenskyy into an unfair agreement to end the war with Russia. Sponsor Message There are big issues that Europe wants to ensure they have a voice on — especially after Zelenskyy was not invited to last week's summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up," Trump wrote on his social media website, Truth Social. They're coming here tomorrow because we've been working with the Europeans." He emphasized that the Europeans were invited because enough progress has been made to justify moving to the next phase of discussions. "Enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this." Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on CNN's State of the Union, that the U.S. is working on concessions from Russia that — in his words — would be "game changing." "We were able to win the following concession that the United States could offer Article 5 like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," Witkoff said, referring to NATO's collective defense clause.

Article: capital braces for a second week with soldiers and masked federal agents conducting "roving patrols" on the city streets, President Trump says he knows some Americans fear he's crossed a dangerous line. So instead of saying 'He's a dictator,' they should say, 'We're going to join him and make Washington safe.'" It's impossible to untangle the impulses that led Trump to abruptly militarize law enforcement in D.C., putting hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents on the streets, while attempting a chaotic takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department. Sponsor Message But Trump has long made crime, especially when committed by young Black men, a central part of his populist message, dating back to his time as a high-profile real estate developer in New York City. During his first inaugural presidential address in 2016, Trump spoke of "mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities" while promising to end what he called "American carnage." But critics say a deeply troubling aspect of Trump's unfolding crackdown in D.C. Administration officials portrayed the crackdown very differently, as a sign of "bold leadership." toggle caption Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Is there an end game to Trump's military surge in Washington? "In less than ten days, over 300 dangerous criminals have already been arrested and taken off the streets of Washington, D.C.," said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers in a statement to NPR. "President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital." But federal officials haven't offered any plan for how this surge of troops and federal agents will end. "We're simply moving the problem around, we're not really providing a solution to folks' homelessness," said Dana White, who works with a social service program in Washington called Miriam's Kitchen. Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled there won't be a quick resolution to the crisis when she attempted to install Terry Cole, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the "emergency police chief" with daily command and control of the Metropolitan Police. At times, Trump has seemed to relish the idea of a violent confrontation between law enforcement and those he views as criminals, saying last Monday that police should be allowed to do "whatever the hell they want" and arguing that tough tactics are needed to restore order. residents, meanwhile, Mayor Muriel Bowser called the first week of Trump's emergency a "crisis" and acknowledged people are feeling "waves of anxiety." Bowser noted the city's public school year begins in just over a week and said families are struggling to maintain a sense of normalcy.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: He invested $400,000 in two real estate projects: A luxury apartment building in downtown Nashville overseen by former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann's family office, and a three-building renovation in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York. I just worry that it's going to keep happening to others." Distributed risk Yieldstreet, founded in 2015, is one of the best-known examples of American startups with the stated mission of democratizing access to assets such as real estate, litigation proceeds and private credit. But Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they've learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration. The company said in a statement that its real estate equity offerings from 2021 and 2022 were "significantly impacted" by rising interest rates and market conditions that pressured valuations industrywide. CNBC's analysis covers a wide swath of deals that the company offered between 2021 and 2024, but doesn't include every project, of which there were at least 55, according to Yieldstreet. They include apartment complexes in boomtowns such as Atlanta, Dallas and Nashville, Tennessee; developments in coastal cities including New York, Boston and Portland, Oregon; apartment buildings in the Midwest and single-family rental homes across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Additionally, Yieldstreet shut down a real estate investment trust made up of six of the above projects last year as its value plunged by nearly half, locking up customer money for at least two years. Yieldstreet's overall returns in real estate have plunged in the past two years; the category went from a 9.4% annual return rate in 2023 to a 2% return rate in the company's most recent update on its website. But only customers participating in a specific fund get information about its performance, and Yieldstreet labels its investor updates "confidential," warning customers that the information in them can't be shared without consent from the startup. Frustrated by those delays and what he described as a lack of candor from Yieldstreet about his sinking investments, Klish turned to forums on Facebook and Reddit for a sense of the bigger picture. Missing ships, busted tie-up Yieldstreet calls itself the leading platform offering access to the private markets, a category that has boomed over the past decade as professional investors seek sources of yield beyond stocks and bonds. "You do that by helping people generate consistent, passive income." Weisz, who became CEO of Yieldstreet in 2023, brought experience in litigation finance, where hedge funds lend money to plaintiffs for a slice of the payout if the lawsuit wins. It was becoming clear that customers in another one of its product lines — loans backed by commercial ships that are torn apart for scrap metal — would suffer losses, the firm told them in March, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Yieldstreet lost track of 13 ships in international waters that backed $89 million in member loans, according to an April 2020 lawsuit filed by the startup against the borrower in that project, which it accused of fraud. A Yieldstreet spokeswoman at the time told The Wall Street Journal that the BlackRock launch was initially successful but the fund "was then faced with the market environment caused by Covid-19." Yieldstreet co-founders Milind Mehere, at left, and Michael Weisz Source: Yieldstreet Three years later, the SEC fined Yieldstreet $1.9 million for selling a $14.5 million marine loan to investors even when it had reason to believe the borrower had stolen proceeds from related deals. "YieldStreet aims to unlock the complex alternative investments market for retail investors but failed to disclose glaring red flags it had about the security of the collateral backing this offering," an SEC official said in a 2023 release accompanying the settlement, for which the company neither denied nor admitted to the agency's findings. By 2023, real estate funds made up 26% of all investments on the platform, the largest asset category and well ahead of runners-up such as private credit, Yieldstreet said at the time. Projects that Yieldstreet put its customers into struggled to hit revenue targets amid price competition or had problems filling vacancies or raising rents, and thus began to fall behind on loan payments, according to investor letters. Source: Google Earth Combined with the use of leverage, or borrowing money that amplifies both risks and returns, Yieldstreet investors suffered complete losses on projects in Nashville, Atlanta and New York's Upper West Side neighborhood, the letters show. "After exhausting all options to preserve value, YieldStreet determined there was no reasonable path to recovery," the firm told customers who invested $15 million in the Upper West Side deal. "We sold our position for $1." It's unclear if Yieldstreet, which makes money by charging annual management fees of around 2% on invested funds, itself suffered financial losses on the defaults. In at least a half dozen cases, Yieldstreet went to its user base again in 2023 and 2024 to raise rescue funds for troubled deals, telling members that the loans combined the protections of debt with the upside of equity. resulting in a complete loss of capital for investors." In a statement provided in response to CNBC's reporting for this article, Yieldstreet said it has offered 149 real estate deals since inception and has delivered positive returns on 94% of matured investments in the category. That 94% figure likely doesn't include the distressed projects that CNBC has identified, since those funds aren't yet classified as matured while Yieldstreet seeks to salvage projects on its watchlist. "Of the nearly $5 billion invested across the platform, a set of real estate equity offerings originated during 2021–2022 were significantly impacted by rising interest rates and broader market conditions that pressured multifamily valuations across the industry," Yieldstreet said through a spokeswoman. But several professional investors pointed to the possibility that, instead of securing only top-quality deals in real estate, Yieldstreet may be getting ones that are picked over by more established players. "There's no question you've seen deals that institutions have passed on that went to the platforms because retail investors might have less discipline than the institutional ones," said Greg Friedman, CEO of Peachtree Group, an Atlanta-based commercial real estate investment firm. In the post, Yieldstreet gave the example of the Alterra Apartments, a multifamily project in Tucson, Arizona, where it said rent increases and a contractual cap on interest rates protected it from the Fed hikes. Mark Underhill, a 57-year-old software engineer, said he invested $600,000 across 22 Yieldstreet funds and faces $200,000 in losses on projects that are on watchlist and have never made payouts. They talked about how their deals were backed by collateral, and they gave you all these reasons that make you feel there's something left if the deal goes south." Underhill, who was treated with chemotherapy for multiple myeloma last year and travels the American West in a camper van, said his losses are forcing him to work beyond his expected retirement date. Courtesy: Mark Underhill The offering sheet for the Upper West Side project said sales prices would have to plunge 35% for Yieldstreet members to see any losses, a worse hit than what New York experienced during the 2008 recession, Klish wrote in his July complaint to the SEC. In another example, while participants in the Nashville deals got letters showing a complete loss, or a -100% return, Yieldstreet's public-facing website listed a 0% internal rate of return, or IRR, giving the false impression that investors got all their capital back.

Article: The announcement comes after Myanmar’s military administration, led by Min Aung Hlaing, last month declared the end of a state of emergency for parts of the country in preparation for elections in December and January. Opposition groups, including Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, have pledged to boycott the elections, viewing them as a sham aimed at buttressing Min Aung Hlaing’s hold on power. Myanmar has been racked by civil war since the coup, with large swaths of the country controlled by various rebel groups, including the People’s Defence Force, the Arakan Army, and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. After the National League for Democracy swept the poll in a landslide, the military claimed the vote was tainted by widespread fraud before arresting Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other democratically elected leaders. Advertisement Independent election monitoring groups, including the Asian Network for Free Elections and the Carter Center, have dismissed claims of widespread fraud and said the outcome was broadly in line with the wishes of the public.

Bondi also instructed an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia’s actions during the 2016 election. Dominic Gwinn / AFP via Getty Images file Bondi’s order came weeks after National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard accused Obama and his aides of a “treasonous conspiracy” and said she had sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Democrats say new probes are an effort to distract attention from allegations that Trump has abused his power in his second term and from his failure to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. “And I want him to put criminals in prison for a very long time.” Road map for a Florida federal investigation Davis called for Quiñones to convene a special federal grand jury in Port St. Viewing the Mar-a-Lago search as part of a decadelong anti-Trump conspiracy serves a legal purpose: It could allow prosecutors to treat alleged acts from 2016 and 2017 as part of a single conspiracy and bypass a five-year statute of limitations on denial of rights charges. Three former FBI and Justice Department officials with direct knowledge of the Mar-a-Lago search told NBC News that it was conducted properly and approved by a federal judge and that it was the result of Trump’s own actions. Multiple investigations of Democratic rivals underway Three people familiar with the matter confirmed to NBC News this month that the Justice Department has opened a federal criminal investigation of lawsuits James’ office filed against Trump. The James probe is examining whether the state attorney general’s office committed “conspiracy against rights” and violated Trump’s civil rights when it brought a lawsuit that claimed Trump grossly inflated the values of his assets for personal profit. Separately, the Bondi Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation in Virginia into possible mortgage fraud by James and another into Schiff in connection with an allegation of potential mortgage fraud in Maryland. Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor whom Republicans have accused of conspiring with former FBI Director James Comey, said filing criminal charges based on debunked claims is possible. “If you’re willing to ignore the facts,” Richman said, “you can come up with criminal charges.” But Richman cautioned that securing a federal indictment, trial and conviction — even in areas where the majority of voters voted for Trump — would be difficult given the many actors and elements involved. “I’m not ready to say the people in these jurisdictions are totally in the tank for this administration.” A former senior national security official who spoke anonymously, citing the Trump administration’s public attacks on former officials, suggested two potential scenarios: “Either Bondi and Gabbard know that there is indeed no evidence of any criminal activity, in which case it’s completely corrupt and a political stunt,” the former official said, “or, more darkly, they actually believe this stuff and are acting out of authoritarian instinct and this is something out of Orwell.”

Article: But it's mostly up to the states to draw the specific districts within state boundaries as long as the districts have roughly the same number of people (about 700,000 now). Critics noted that one district was shaped like a salamander, so they combined the two words into "Gerry-mander." The Brennan Center for Justice, an organization that seeks to end gerrymandering, states on its website: "Gerrymandering, the practice of drawing districts to favor one political party or racial group, skews election results, makes races less competitive, hurts communities of color, and thwarts the will of the voters." Often, the party in control has gerrymandered by "packing" voters of the opposing party into a limited number of districts, containing their voting power to certain areas. Sponsor Message Lawmakers have also "cracked" voters of the opposing party or Black voters into different districts to dilute their votes so that they have little say over who wins a race in any one district. Democrats, who are in the minority in the Texas House, left the state, meaning not enough members were present — a quorum — to hold the vote and approve the maps. Sponsor Message That's racial "cracking" and is illegal, as is racial "packing." That's when voters of color are lumped into one district to remove them from several other districts, in order to create or maintain white majorities in those districts.

Article: The human rights group Amnesty International has accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza as the United Nations and aid groups warn of famine in the Palestinian enclave. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” The group accused Israel of “systematically destroying the health, wellbeing and social fabric of Palestinian life”. “It is the intended outcome of plans and policies that Israel has designed and implemented, over the past 22 months, to deliberately inflict on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction – which is part and parcel of Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,” Amnesty said. The report is based on interviews conducted in recent weeks with 19 displaced Palestinians in Gaza sheltering in three makeshift camps as well as two medical staff members in two hospitals in Gaza City. I panic just thinking about the potential impact of my own hunger on the baby’s health, its weight, whether it will have [birth defects] and, even if the baby is born healthy, what life awaits it, amid displacement, bombs, tents,” Hadeel, 28, a mother of two who is four months pregnant, was quoted as saying in the report. Erika Guevara Rosas, senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns at Amnesty International, said in a statement: “As Israeli authorities threaten to launch a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza City, the testimonies we have collected are far more than accounts of suffering, they are a searing indictment of an international system that has granted Israel a license to torment Palestinians with near-total impunity for decades.” Nearly one million Palestinians in Gaza City, many of whom have been displaced multiple times in the past two years, face forced displacement as Israel has intensified its attacks on the enclave’s main urban centre. Call for truce Rosas called for “an immediate, unconditional lifting of the blockade and a sustained ceasefire” for reversing “the devastating consequences of Israel’s inhumane policies and actions” in Gaza. Rosas concluded: “The impact of Israel’s blockade and its ongoing genocide on civilians, particularly on children, people with disabilities, those with chronic illnesses, older people and pregnant and breastfeeding women is catastrophic and cannot be undone by simply increasing the number of aid trucks or restoring performative, ineffective and dangerous airdrops of aid.” The Israeli military and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not make statements about Amnesty’s findings at the time of publication. The enclave – home to 2.1 million people – had already been under an Israeli land, air and sea blockade since 2007, but since the war began, Israel has tightened it, at times stopping all aid from entering and now allows only a trickle of supplies into the Strip. In a report issued last week, the Israeli military body overseeing civil affairs in Palestinian territory rejected claims of widespread malnutrition in Gaza despite widespread condemnation from the UN and the international community in general. ‘Famine unfolding before our eyes’ Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan and several of their European allies have called on Israel to allow unrestricted aid into Gaza, stressing that the humanitarian crisis has reached “unimaginable levels”. Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation,” the foreign ministers of about two dozen countries and the European Union’s top diplomat said in a joint statement last week. In April, Amnesty accused Israel of committing a “livestreamed genocide” against Palestinians by forcibly displacing Palestinians in Gaza and creating a humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged territory, claims that Israel dismissed at the time as “blatant lies”.

Article: As of August 17, the known number of people who have starved to death in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry there, reached at least 258 people, including 110 children. On August 14, more than 100 aid organisations, including prominent groups such as Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Amnesty International, and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), condemned Israel’s weaponisation of aid, saying it was obstructing life-saving assistance from entering Gaza. On Monday, rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza and of “systematically destroying the health, wellbeing and social fabric of Palestinian life”. “It is the intended outcome of plans and policies that Israel has designed and implemented, over the past 22 months, to deliberately inflict on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction – which is part and parcel of Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,” Amnesty said. In Gaza, where food shortages have been severe for months, more and more images are emerging of children in the “red” zone on MUAC tapes, which measure the circumference of the upper arm to assess malnutrition.

" Listen on BBC Sounds: George and Annetta came to the UK as part of the Windrush generation Ms Stanley's father George came to the UK in the early 1960s as part of the Windrush generation that relocated to fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild Britain's economy. Monthly payments of about £500 went to his widow for 19 years but, after Aon took over as administrators of the scheme in 2024, the money stopped, said Ms Stanley, from Herefordshire. It's appalling that we've been treated this way." Annetta Stanley Mervis and George married in Jamaica before moving to the UK Ms Stanley, who has power of attorney for her mother and deals with all her financial affairs, said she had contacted Aon dozens of times by phone, email and letter since February, to establish why her mum's pension was stopped.

The company added that payments could be paused if items of post were returned unopened and that this was usual practice amongst UK pension schemes, designed to protect members and make sure that the correct people received benefits. I've worked in finance for 40 years, so I knew what to do, but it's been a difficult fight." A spokesperson for Aon said, after the BBC contacted them about Mrs Stanley's case, that, after receiving some more information, they have reinstated her pension and the company had arranged for her to be paid the money she was owed.

Article: toggle caption @DHSgov and @WhiteHouse via X/Screenshot by NPR Last month, the White House X account posted an illustration of President Trump looking determined, framed by eagles, fireworks, the American flag and a cloud of cash. The White House's X account, as well as that of the Department of Homeland Security, have for months been posting a steady stream of content celebrating the administration, especially its aggressive immigration crackdown, often framed as ironic comedy. One from February includes footage of immigrants boarding planes with handcuffs and chains rattling, captioned "ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight," referring to a genre of videos featuring sounds meant to evoke a calming and pleasant experience. The posts are deeply polarizing: popular among a swath of Trump fans who share them and comment favorably, while generating outcry from critics who object to their tone and content. This approach "speaks to the people who enjoy the irreverence, who enjoy the cruelty, who enjoy the 'owning the libs,'" said Ryan Milner, a professor of communication at the College of Charleston who studies Internet culture. Sponsor Message In response to NPR's questions about the agency's social media posts, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin called the inquiry "deranged and delusional." She continued: "If the media needs a history lesson on the brave men and women who blazed the trails, forded the rivers, and forged this Republic from the sweat of their brow, we are happy to send them a history textbook." She added, "This administration is unapologetically proud of American history and American heritage. Deport.' As DHS steps up its campaign to hire some 10,000 new ICE agents, fueled by a budget influx from Trump's tax cut and spending bill, the agency's social media accounts have been flush with recruitment imagery. The images conjure a narrative that "we had a wonderful white civilization and culture that has been decimated by these people who don't belong here, who just happen to not be white people for the most part," Beirich said. She added that with posts like these, DHS is "just saying the quiet part out loud, and it's the sort of baldness of doing it that's amazing to me." toggle caption @DHSgov via X/Screenshot by NPR After DHS posted John Gast's 1872 painting "American Progress" in late July with the caption "A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending," the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, where the original painting is displayed, was flooded with inquiries. The painting has become known as a depiction of the 19th-century concept of "manifest destiny," the belief that white settlers were destined by God to expand across the North American continent. Sponsor Message In Aron's description, the painting shows Native Americans and bison "peacefully mak[ing] way" as a "parade of white pioneer types move across the continent." They are led by a large, floating blonde female figure in a white gown, with a school book in one hand and telegraph wire in the other, as "a symbol of civilizing progress." "This is a whitening vision of the West," Aron said. At the Autry Museum, pieces by Native American artists are displayed facing the Gast painting and others like it, serving, in Aron's words, as "a reminder of who was here first — whose heritage, whose homeland." Beirich said it is disturbing that DHS is celebrating a racist depiction of western expansion. "The fact that they're using that as a way to inspire people to sign on to become ICE agents is very troubling, because the whole thing is framed as 'white people need to reclaim their territory,'" Beirich said. A recent image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads is captioned "Which way, American man?" The phrase is similar to a meme sometimes used by right-wing accounts that borrows the title of the 1978 book "Which Way Western Man?" by white nationalist William Gayley Simpson. Uncle Sam, who represents America, is at a crossroads, pondering which way America should go." McLaughlin did not respond to NPR's additional question about how DHS intends the white-centric imagery it posts to be interpreted. One video posted in late July shows helmeted and heavily armed border agents dressed in military fatigues overlaid with sound from the opening monologue of the 2022 film The Batman. A Bible verse appears on the screen: "'THE WICKED FLEE WHEN NO MAN PURSUETH; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION.' —PROVERBS 28:1." The post's caption is addressed "TO EVERY CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN IN AMERICA" and reads: "Darkness is no longer your ally. You represent an existential threat to the citizens of the United States, and US Border Patrol's Special Operations Group will stop at nothing to hunt you down." Such videos tie into Christian nationalist ideas and have "a very Crusades feeling," Beirich said. And I'm assuming that's what they're trying to get at." 'oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHiS?' The DHS posts are just the latest phase of the Trump administration's embrace of inflammatory content and viral memes. toggle caption @WhiteHouse via X/Screenshot by NPR In late March, the White House posted an AI-generated depiction of a Dominican woman crying during her arrest by immigration officers, rendered in the playful animation style of Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, the makers of "Spirited Away" and "My Neighbor Totoro." After online backlash about the post, White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr wrote on X that Americans should be upset by the woman's previous conviction for trafficking fentanyl, not the anime-style post. "This trolling is an active strategy," said Roland Meyer, a professor of digital cultures and arts at the University of Zurich and Zurich University of the Arts in Switzerland who has been analyzing the images shared by Trump administration accounts. He described the posts as a demonstration of state power that serve to normalize the administration's aggressive approach towards immigrants, as well as "making fun [of] and trolling those who oppose it." Sponsor Message "They have the power to define who is visible, who is not, what is acceptable and what is not," Meyer said. "They also kind of control the discourse, and also anticipate the reaction to their postings." The inflammatory tone and style of the posts derives from internet humor that was developed in the 2000s and 2010s on places like Reddit and 4chan, Meyer and Milner said. White House staffer Dorr's own profile on X includes a banner that reads, "oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHiS?" in the mixed case font used online to signify mockery. If you have comments, if you have shares, if you have likes, if you have coverage from NPR, that's all good." By posting images like the Ghiblified arrest, the administration's accounts are participating in a trend of making and sharing AI-generated images that blend pop culture with real-world news events. Since January, the White House X account, as well as Trump's Truth Social feed, has continued the habit, sharing apparently AI-generated renderings of the president in a crown on the cover of Time Magazine, in papal robes, striding through the Colosseum and as Superman. Milner said the administration's use of art and images reminds him of "agitprop" — a portmanteau for agitation and propaganda that was a hallmark of the Soviet Union's communication strategy. Sponsor Message "The goal is to create a sense of culture, to create a sense of ideology and affiliation to that ideology with the art and culture that you're putting out," Milner said. toggle caption @WhiteHouse via X/Screenshot by NPR The British pop artist Jess Glynne, whose song is featured in a viral TikTok trend that pairs audio from a British airline ad promoting a "Jet2 holiday" with video of vacation mishaps, took to Instagram to denounce a White House video that used the audio. The White House's version, posted to X and Instagram, overlaid the soundtrack from the travel ad on footage of immigrants boarding a deportation flight, with the caption "When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation." "This post honestly makes me sick," Glynne wrote. The band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club took action after its rendition of the song "God's Gonna Cut You Down" was featured in one of DHS's religion-themed recruitment videos last month without the band's permission. "It's obvious that you don't respect Copyright Law and Artist Rights any more than you respect Habeas Corpus and Due Process rights, not to mention the separation of Church and State per the US Constitution," the post read. toggle caption Screenshot by NPR On X, the post now says the video "has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner." The video still appears on Instagram but without any audio. After the DHS account posted a painting of a white couple in a covered wagon cradling an infant with the caption, "Remember your Homeland's Heritage," the artist, Morgan Weistling, posted a statement that temporarily appeared on his website noting that the agency had used his painting without his permission. After a Washington Post article referred to DHS posting an "explicitly racist painting" in reference to "American Progress," McLaughlin wrote on X, "Uh oh— The @washingtonpost must have fallen asleep during their Art History course!" and added, "It is one of the most historically significant paintings of its era." White House officials have also taken to pointing out publicly available political donations to Democrats made by sources quoted in news coverage in an apparent effort to discredit them as partisan. "The 'expert' they cite throughout the story is a major Democrat donor and longtime sufferer of Trump Derangement Syndrome," Cheung wrote on X, posting a screenshot of Federal Election Commission records of the individual's political contributions. After learning that Milner, the College of Charleston professor, would be quoted, Jackson pointed out that public records show that seven years ago he made two donations totaling $30 to ActBlue, which fundraises for Democrats. "In addition to noting that this so-called expert is a Dem donor, here is a statement from me," Jackson wrote in her email sharing the White House's comment for this story. Sponsor Message Milner told NPR the White House's comment about him made him "chuckle a little bit" given the small amount he gave several years ago in support of a Democratic congressional candidate. "I've never been to a fundraising gala or bought a plate anywhere or done much except for ignore a lot of text messages from people asking for more small donations," Milner said. Milner sees the Trump administration's interactions with news media as "steeped in what we used to call 'lulz' — this kind of trollish online antagonism, this gleeful laughter at somebody else's expense." To Milner, the gravest potential consequences of the administration's tactic of highlighting past donations of people who speak to journalists is that it chills dissent. "Whether it's an explicit goal or not, there is a potential to silence people, to make people think twice before they speak up with critiques of the administration because they're going to be named and shamed," Milner said.

Demonstrations called for Sunday had been billed as a day of Israeli solidarity with the families of the hostages held in Gaza and a call to stop the war and bring the captives home. The Israeli public is particularly divided over the stated goals in Gaza of the Israeli government: eliminating Hamas as a military and ruling force and releasing the remaining 50 hostages, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.

Article: Hurricane threatens US East Coast with life-threatening waves Dangerous surf and rip tides have been forecast for the US East Coast Erin, the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, "explosively deepened and intensified" on Saturday into a Category 5 storm, before briefly losing force and now regaining strength. While Erin is not expected to make landfall on the islands, it is expected to bring rainfall of up to six inches (15.2cm) to the Turks and Caicos and the eastern Bahamas. The NHC forecast is for the core of Erin to pass to the east of the south-eastern Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the eastern coast of the US by the middle of the week.

Article: The percentage of dogs across California that tested positive for exposure to the bacterium that causes anaplasmosis skyrocketed in the last five years, nearly tripling between 2021 and 2024, according to data from the nonprofit Companion Animal Parasite Council. “When the prevalence starts to go up in the animal population, we know that the public health risk has, by default, also gone up.” Anaplasmosis and Lyme disease are spread by western blacklegged ticks. ‘It’s very much here’ Climate change is among a cocktail of factors fueling an increase in tick-borne illnesses across the country, as warming temperatures allow parasites to march into new areas and lengthen their season. “Unfortunately, the doctors don’t always recognize that, so it’s really hard sometimes for people to get the right care.” In context Relative to other parts of the country, the prevalence of anaplasmosis among dogs in Southern California remains low, with the parasite council forecastin g roughly 1% to 2% this year. “I always joke, unless your vet clinic is set up right in the middle of Death Valley National Park, where you hardly get any rain at all throughout the year, there’s nothing that’s going to stop the establishment of these western blacklegged ticks, or deer ticks, across Southern California,” Ryan said. “So we’re going to see more cases here, in dogs and people, because there’s going to be more travel-imported anaplasma.” Advertisement Local factors may also be linked to the trend. In the human realm, Schweig described a huge fight over appropriate testing and treatment, “like a religious battle,” between groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Infectious Diseases Society of America “versus people like me” and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation, where he serves as a scientific advisory board member. “Unfortunately, when you go to the human doctor they do not ever routinely offer these tests, unless you, like, pull this tick off of you and you have a fever.” Advertisement Staying safe Ticks are active throughout the year in California, but risk typically peaks in the spring when the biting arthropods are born, and in fall, after the first rains.

If a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in a popular neighborhood can make around $10,000 per month as a short-term rental, it could still bring in $8,000 per month as a mid-term rental, Vasquez said. Last year, Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky identified mid-term stays as a “huge growth opportunity” for the company, and said such bookings make up 18% of the company’s business compared with 13% to 14% before the pandemic. Mark Lawson used to rent out his San Fernando Valley home on VRBO for weekend stays, but last year he set the parameters to only accept bookings of 30 days or more. While advocates say sites such as Airbnb and VRBO offer income for homeowners and options for tourists, critics claim home-sharing removes long-term rentals from a market in the midst of a housing crisis. Advertisement To prevent L.A.’s housing stock from being converted into short-term rentals, Los Angeles in 2018 passed the Home-Sharing Ordinance , which regulates short-term rentals by restricting hosts to renting out only their primary residences and requiring them to get a license. The plan calls for 18 staffers to monitor violations and increased fines based on the square footage of the rental: $1,000 for rentals less than 500 square feet, up to $16,000 for homes greater than 25,000 square feet. “L.A.’s ordinance combines all the strict rules from other markets around the country.” Jones said the potential for $1,000 fines — now able to be doled out without a warning beforehand — are causing some hosts to remove listings from the market out of fear, since the fines far exceed the nightly revenue brought in by the average listing. Her space was larger than 500 square feet, so under the new rules, it could be subject to a $2,000 fine for the first violation, $4,000 for the second, and $8,000 for the third.

Article: BBC witnesses Israeli settlers' attack on Palestinian farm in West Bank 50 minutes ago Share Save Lucy Williamson BBC News, Turmus Aya, in the occupied West Bank Share Save The BBC's Lucy Williamson witnessed an attack by masked settlers From among the broken remains of Brahim Hamaiel's olive trees, in the occupied West Bank, we saw the masked men approach. Fred Scott, BBC Masked settlers ran into the Palestinian farmland His family have farmed olives here on land near Turmus Aya, for generations, making it a target for extremist settlers who think killing Palestinian trees and livestock will also kill the idea of a Palestinian State, by forcing residents like Brahim off their land. "But there's something stronger than fear that drives me to stay here – the scent of my ancestors and an attachment dating back hundreds of years – even if I pay the price with my blood." As the masked men run towards us, we pull back to the road and drive a safe distance away. Fred Scott, BBC Brahim Hamaiel stands next to the broken remains of his olive trees Vegetation by the side of the road is set on fire, its smoke signalling the site of the confrontation, as settlers on a quad bike chase away a volunteer emergency crew trying to reach a farmhouse in the middle of the field. Palestinians living in these villages south of Nablus say there are attacks and confrontations on their lands every week, and that settlers are using these kinds of tactics to take over the land, field by field. Fred Scott, BBC Israeli settlers set fire to vehicles and homes Rifa told us her husband was trapped in their farmhouse near Brahim's olive farm, and surrounded by settlers, but that the army wouldn't let her pass. They have weapons, we have nothing." We later learned that settlers had torched part of their property, and that Rifa's husband had been left with cuts to his face and leg, after being hit with rocks. The Israeli organisation Peace Now, which monitors the spread of settlements in the West Bank, says the number of outposts – and settler aggression – has multiplied since the Hamas attacks on Israel in October 2023, and the Gaza War that followed. Last week, Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, announced the creation of thousands of new housing units in a large West Bank settlement bloc further south, saying it would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state". Between 5-11 August, the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs documented at least 27 settler attacks against Palestinians that resulted in casualties, property damage or both, across two dozen different communities. Brahim told us he had filed two separate complaints about the attacks on his land, but few Palestinians here have much faith in Israeli justice or security forces, saying repeatedly that they protect only the settlers. But they [the army] stop us and stand in our way." Fred Scott, BBC Mother of 18-year-old Hamdan Abu-Elaya cries at his funeral, after he was shot and killed by Israel troops

Article: Although he kept his expectations low and described the high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a way to determine whether Moscow was committed to participating in a serious peace process to end the war in Ukraine, it was clear from the get-go that Trump wanted to leave the meeting with some kind of ceasefire in hand. Trump not only failed to get the immediate, unconditional ceasefire he was pining for, but he also got bludgeoned by foreign policy commentators who faulted him for gifting Putin international legitimacy for nothing in return. Trump sounded downright solemn during his 12-minute “press conference” with Putin, admitting straight away that while unidentified progress was made, there wasn’t enough common ground to hash out even a rough, preliminary outline of a deal. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” It doesn’t take a genius in international affairs to understand that “the most significant” item he was referring to was the one issue that prompted him to organize a summit with Putin in the first place: the war in Ukraine. Trump may have an inherently oversized opinion of his capacity to will peace deals into existence, but on Ukraine at least, he’s not the most important person in the story. That honor goes to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, two men who not only have a visceral hatred toward each other but more importantly a set of goals that are as close to irreconcilable as you can get. Trump believed he could use his hours with Putin as an opportunity, if not to move Putin closer to middle ground, then at least to begin a high-level diplomatic process that would get Putin into the same room with the Ukrainian leader. Despite the hyperventilation surrounding the Alaska meeting, Trump wasn’t wrong to extend an invitation to Putin to determine whether a path forward existed; this isn’t the first time a U.S. Rather, the problem is that Putin remains committed to fighting, still believes he can achieve more by continuing the war than he can through negotiations and has prioritized success in Ukraine over everything else — including an improvement in U.S.-Russia relations. Unfortunately for everybody who wants the war to end in a diplomatic settlement, Putin doesn’t have much of an incentive to sign up to anything when the battlefield has shifted in Moscow’s favor. One can’t say the same about the Ukrainian army, whose manpower issues are getting more serious as the war persists and whose population is increasingly supportive of a deal that ends the war over slugging it out until victory. The Ukrainians may not want to cede a chunk of their country to the Russians, but neither do they want to continue a war that is exhausting the country economically, socially and demographically. Look no further than Friday, when Putin reportedly told Trump that he would sign up to a ceasefire and freeze the current battle lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson if Ukrainian forces withdrew from the entire Donbas region, 30% of which the Ukrainian army still controls. Zelenskyy and a group of European leaders will meet with Trump at the White House on Monday for a full debriefing of what Trump and Putin talked about in Alaska, and it’s likely the Trump administration will try to entice both sides of the conflict to participate in a bilateral summit to keep the process moving. The second option would be to double down on the Biden administration’s own policy, which consisted of sanctions on the Russian economy and providing ending supplies of military equipment to the Ukrainian army with the presumption that Putin would, over time, sue for peace on Kyiv’s terms. A third option, and the least painless one for the United States, would be to hand over the Ukraine file completely to the Europeans, who have a greater stake in the endgame than Washington does. European governments are already stepping up in a big way for Ukraine, both in terms of the financial assistance they are providing to Kyiv as well as military aid they are willing to give.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: Who: Real Madrid vs Osasuna What: Spanish La Liga Where: Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid, Spain When: Tuesday 9pm (19:00 GMT) How to follow: We’ll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 6pm (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream of the match. The 36-time Spanish domestic champions approach the new season with several new signings and fresh hope under recently appointed coach Xabi Alonso and are looking to turn the page on a disappointing end to the Carlo Ancelotti era with “ambitious” football. But as Alonso saw firsthand in his Real managerial debut at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States this summer – Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Madrid 4-0 in the semifinal – there is plenty of work to do if the megaclub wants to reclaim its La Liga title from Barcelona in the new season. Alonso’s Vinicius-Mbappe challenge Alonso, who wants to implement some version of the 3-4-2-1 formation that won him the Bundesliga title with Bayer Leverkusen in 2023, faces a huge challenge to unlock the chemistry between his two superstar forwards: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior. Both Mbappe, who scored 44 goals in his debut season at Real, and Vinicius, whose scoring output dipped substantially after the Frenchman’s arrival, are being told they must contribute more off the ball this season and set a better example for the team, according to reporting by the Marca newspaper. If the two players again fail to consistently connect up front in the 2025-2026 season, the constant rumour mill of a Vinicius exit from the club will begin churning once more. The teams played out a controversial 1-1 draw on February 19 when 10-man Real squandered a chance to cement their lead on top of the La Liga ladder after Jude Bellingham was sent off in the 39th minute for what appeared to be an argument with the match referee. Los Blancos’ hope is for Turkish playmaker Arda Guler, who is entering his second season with the club, to be able to thrive there and become a player who can control the tempo of a game. Towering centre back Dean Huijsen joins the club from Bournemouth after signing a 50 million pounds ($67m) deal on May 17 and is also expected to line up in the starting XI. “Following tests conducted on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, the player has been diagnosed with a sprain to his right ankle,” the 15-time European champions wrote on their website. Possible lineups: Real Madrid possible starting XI: Courtois (GK); Alexander-Arnold, Huijsen, Militao; Carreras, Guler, Tchouameni, Ceballos; Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr; Mbappe Osasuna possible starting XI: Herrera (GK); Arnaiz, Boyomo, Catena, Cruz; Torro, Garcia; Oroz, Munoz, Gomez; Budimir Head-to-head: In their last five matches against Osasuna, Real Madrid have won four and drawn once: Osasuna 1, Real Madrid 1 – February 16, La Liga Real Madrid 4, Osasuna 0 – November 10, La Liga Osasuna 2, Real Madrid 4 – March 17, 2024, La Liga Real Madrid 4, Osasuna 0 – October 8, 2023, La Liga Real Madrid 2, Osasuna 1 – May 7, 2023, Copa del Rey final

He's written two books called "Restart Roadmap Rewire and Reset Your Career" and "Talk Money to Me: The 8 Essential Financial Questions to Discuss with Your Partner." Tartick said that he's been watching this season of "Bachelor in Paradise," and he has some advice for whoever wins the show's $500,000 prize.

When it comes to whether or not he'd do reality television again, possibly being the next "Bachelor," he didn't rule it out. "I always say like, you never say never, but I will say since like I don't know what was it, like the last two years there have been five different shows that have approached me to go on and my desire to go back on reality tv is quite low right now, so never say never, but I'd prefer if I was going to go back in for it to be a competition like show but you never know," Tartick said.

Article: President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Alaska meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, U.S., August 15,2025. Friday's Alaska summit raised concerns in Europe that Trump might have softened his stance toward potential sanctions on Russia, and is now pushing for a permanent peace deal in Ukraine instead of an initial ceasefire — an approach more aligned with Moscow's position. EU officials still recall Zelenskyy's incendiary appearance in the Oval office in February, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized the Ukrainian leader in front of TV cameras for not being thankful enough for U.S. "The idea is to make sure [Trump] has the same objectives as Europe." The same diplomat outlined: "Our main objectives are: security guarantees, stop the killing and go for a trilateral meeting."

Article: RUN YTD mountain RUN YTD chart As a catalyst, Dendrinos pointed to guidance issued Friday from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits under President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline. "We believe the guidance provides longer term demand visibility and largely removes the uncertainty under Trump's EO calling for stricter Treasury guidance on enforcement of 'commence construction' rules." Furthermore, the expiration of the federal homeowner rooftop solar tax credit in December of this year could drive demand to the third-party ownership market, where a solar company owns and maintains a solar system versus the homeowner, Dendrinos said. "We believe this presents RUN with an opportunity to take share and selectively onboard additional dealers and hire others as non-TPO installers look to restructure and partner with a TPO provider." The analyst added that Sunrun's value proposition lies in its cash generation stemming from opportunities such as higher solar adoption, cost reductions in customer acquisition and higher utility power pricing.

Article: Zelenskyy brings Europe's top leaders with him to meet Trump on ending Russia's war Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings with him an extraordinary cadre of European leaders to show U.S. The European political heavy-hitters were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they are looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. By arriving as a group, they hope to avoid any debacles like Zelenskyy's February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. The meeting also is a test of America's relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump's tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. Monday's showing is a sign both of the progress and the possible distress coming out of the Alaska meeting as many of Europe's leaders are descending on Washington with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine's interests, a rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!" Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, "We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably." He went on to say that "peace must be lasting," not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and "Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack." The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. and European countries Ukraine will be able to force Russia to "true peace." European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in America's capital are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The president also bemoaned media coverage of his summit with Putin, saying on Truth Social: "I had a great meeting in Alaska." Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that "the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." 'A very big move' European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. "How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners who are coming in from overseas," Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press." Rubio said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that such a commitment "would be a very big move" by Trump. Ahead of Monday's meeting, France's Macron stressed the importance of building up Ukraine's military and the need to show Putin that Europe interprets his moves as a threat to other nations. "If we are weak with Russia today, we'll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and - make no mistake - they can impact us, too," Macron said. Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched a total of four Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 140 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight, of which 88 drones were intercepted or jammed.

Article: Trump and his Republican allies wielded the sharp increase in violent crime in urban areas during the pandemic as a campaign cudgel, winning control of the House in the 2022 midterms. Trump expanded his winning coalition two years later, in part with promises to prevent the rest of America from becoming like the cities he called “unlivable, unsanitary nightmares,” deriding the data that showed improvement across the country. While his tactics in Washington, D.C., are extraordinary, the effort is an actualization of one of his most tried-and-true political arguments: Democrats — often Black Democrats — have let lawlessness run rampant in the cities and states they were elected to run.

Article: Martin Barraud | OJO Images | Getty Images The so-called "great resignation" has become the "great stay." But experts say workers aren't just staying — they're "job hugging." Job hugging is the act of holding onto a job "for dear life," consultants at Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm, wrote this week. "There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low," said Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. "There's just not a lot of movement at all." 'Uncertainty in the world' The rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs has lingered near lows unseen since around 2016, outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic. "There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.

Article: And the system has been rigged for as long as I remember, but it’s clearly gotten worse.” In a video accompanying his campaign launch, Brown lays out three principles important to him: “standing up for workers, treating everyone with dignity and respect, working as hard as possible.” “I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,” Brown says in the video. “That’s why I’m running for Senate.” Brown, 72, lost his race for a fourth term last year to Republican Bernie Moreno by about 3.5 percentage points as President Donald Trump carried Ohio by 11 points. Word of his decision to run for Senate — and not for governor, as many Ohio Democrats had been hoping — trickled out last week, reported first by Cleveland.com and confirmed by NBC News. “I really, legitimately, don’t know.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had aggressively lobbied Brown to choose a Senate bid over a run for governor and traveled twice to Ohio to persuade him to take on Husted. The move, which placed Brown and Schultz closer to their grandchildren and to Schultz’s teaching job at Denison University, nonetheless fueled chatter that he was leaning more toward a run for governor. I could have gone either way in that case, but I just think I can have more impact in the Senate.” Brown singled out Husted’s vote for the Trump-backed “big, beautiful bill,” a megabill that has come under fire for its cuts to Medicaid and other federal safety net programs. “By any measure, this is the worst vote he’s cast in the Senate, but it’s a continuum of his running for special interests his whole career.” Husted, 57, like Brown, has spent much of his adult life in public office.

Article: Air Canada suspends restart plans after flight attendants union defies return to work order Air Canada suspended plans to restart operations after the union representing 10,000 flight attendants said it will defy a return to work order. Air Canada said in a statement that the union "illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board." "Our members are not going back to work," Canadian Union of Public Employees national president Mark Hancock said outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job,)Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada's prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full "due to the summer travel peak." Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said "would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada." But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.

Many see pullbacks this month as healthy and strategic cooldowns rather than reactions to crisis, thanks largely to support from crypto ETFs as well as companies focused on aggressively accumulating bitcoin and ether.

Article: Three Republican-led states to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital. Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention. The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. National Guard members are coming from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio The Republican governors of the three states said they were sending hundreds of troops at the request of the Trump administration. Patrick Morrisey said he directed 300 to 400 Guard troops to head to Washington, adding that the state "is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital." South Carolina Gov. Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police from the Guard to "carry out presence patrols and serve as added security" and that they were expected to arrive in the coming days. Protest pushes back on federal crackdown in Washington A protest against Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, "No fascist takeover of D.C.," and some in the crowd held signs saying, "No military occupation." Morgan Taylor, one of the protest organizers, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump's actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda. "I can't believe that this is happening in this country at this time." Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreaching and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. "Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities," Finnigan said. Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was "very uncomfortable and worried" for the safety or her students given the "unmarked officers of all types" now roaming Washington and detaining people. Dickstein said she turned out to the protest with friends and relatives to "prevent a continuous domino effect going forward with other cities." Surge of federal law enforcement in Washington draws mixed reactions Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an "emergency police commissioner" after the district's top lawyer sued. In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the "city government's failure to maintain public order." He said that impeded the "federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence." In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that "our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now." She added that if Washington residents stick together, "we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy - even when we don't have full access to it."

Article: What each side wants from Ukraine talks at White House 28 minutes ago Share Save Laura Gozzi and Tom Geoghegan BBC News Share Save AFP via Getty Images It promises to be a day unlike any other at the White House later, when world leaders make a rare collective visit for crunch talks on Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the EU and Nato have dashed across the Atlantic to have their say on how the three-year-old war with Russia should end and on what terms. Since meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Trump appears to have ditched his criticism of Moscow and the threat of sanctions, and decided to pile the pressure on Zelensky instead. Follow live updates Whirlwind day of talks could reshape Ukraine's future In a late Sunday night social post, he warned the Ukrainian president he must forgo hopes of Nato membership and will have to concede Crimea, which Putin illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine - refuse concessions on territory Zelensky finds himself in the unenviable position of having to stand his ground in the face of an increasingly impatient Donald Trump, who appears to have been swayed by Putin and who has already accused Zelensky of standing in the way of peace. This will be extraordinarily difficult for the Ukrainian president to give in to as it would entail retreating from Donetsk and Luhansk, regions which thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have fought and died to protect since 2022. The vagueness of US statements on the matter is alarming to Europeans who feel protection from potential future attacks by Russia will have to come from a credible American commitment. Last week, a virtual US-EU meeting ahead of the Alaska summit seemed to have the effect of hardening Trump's criticism of Russia; now that he is appearing to be teetering on Moscow's side again, European leaders will try to impress on him that their concerns about the continent's long-term security have not changed.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: As the world focuses on Monday’s meeting at the White House with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other European leaders, Wall Street is turning its attention to Jackson Hole, Wyo., where central bank officials are headed this week and where Jay Powell of the Fed is expected to speak. Investors will try to read between the lines of whatever he says, with September’s rates meeting potentially being his last major decision before President Trump names Powell’s successor, effectively creating a shadow Fed chair. We’re also focused on the news that the World Economic Forum exonerated Klaus Schwab, the group’s founder, after a yearslong drip of anonymous accusations that he and his wife had misused the organization’s resources. Schwab stepped down as a result of the accusations, yet the board said that an investigation found “there is no evidence of material wrongdoing.” Larry Fink of BlackRock and the Swiss philanthropist André Hoffmann will become interim co-chairs of the organization.

Article: US special envoy Tom Barrack has asked Israel to withdraw from the Lebanese territory after Beirut approved a plan to disarm the Hezbollah group by the end of the year, in exchange for an end to Israeli military attacks on its territory. The US-backed plan sets out a four-phase roadmap for the Hezbollah group to hand in their arsenal as Israel’s military halts ground, air and sea operations and withdraws troops from Lebanon’s south. Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan on August 7 despite Hezbollah’s outright refusal to disarm, raising fears that Israel could intensify attacks on Lebanon, even while it carries out near-daily violations of the November truce it signed with Hezbollah to end its war. Barrack described the cabinet’s decision as a “Lebanese decision that requires Israel’s cooperation” and said the US was “in the process of now discussing with Israel what their position is” but provided no further details. ‘An economic proposal’ The US envoy also said Washington would seek an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in the country, after months of shuttle diplomacy between the US and Lebanon. I believe we will witness progress in several areas in the coming weeks.” “This is the first visit of the American envoy to Lebanon after the Lebanese cabinet mandated the Lebanese army to assess how to disarm Hezbollah,” said Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Beirut. “However, there are a lot of concerns with respect to how this process is going to happen, given the fact that Hezbollah refused.” On Friday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem raised the spectre of civil war, warning there would be “no life” in Lebanon should the state attempt to confront or eliminate the group. Under phase one of the US-backed plan, the Lebanese government is to issue a decision committing to Hezbollah’s full disarmament by the end of the year – which it now has – and Israel will cease military operations in Lebanese territory. In phase three, which should happen within 90 days of that, Israel is to withdraw from the last two of the five disputed border positions, and money would be secured for Lebanon’s reconstruction. Advertisement Just on Monday, Israeli attacks blew up a house in the town of Meiss el-Jabal, a sound bomb went off in the border town of Dahra, and drones could be overheard in the towns of Wadi Zefta, al-Numairiyeh and Wadi Kafra, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.

Article: After a summit in Alaska on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Trump suggested on Sunday that a peace agreement could come quickly if Zelenskyy cedes eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region to Russia. Zelenskyy will be joined in Washington, DC, by several European leaders who will be there to support Ukraine’s position and push for its direct involvement in any peace deal and for that deal to be backed by US security guarantees. In addition to Trump, confirmed participants at Monday’s meeting are: Finnish President Alexander Stubb French President Emmanuel Macron German Chancellor Friedrich Merz Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte What are they going to discuss? On Sunday, special Trump envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Putin had agreed for the US and Europe to provide future security protections to Ukraine, similar to NATO’s Article 5 self-defence pact. Von der Leyen welcomed the proposal of NATO-style security guarantees from the US, noting that the “coalition of the willing, including the European Union, is ready to do its share”. On the matter of ceding Ukrainian land to Russia, Zelenskyy appeared to push back against the idea in a post on X in which he described Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and subsequent invasion of eastern Ukraine as a cautionary tale. Zelenskyy wrote that today’s situation is “not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East – part of Donbas – and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Brussels has fretted about Ukraine giving up land and its repercussions for Europe – namely about the potential for Russia to try to expand its borders beyond Ukraine. Since meeting Putin in Alaska, Trump has increased pressure on Ukraine to accept an agreement to end Russia’s war, claiming that Zelenskyy could choose to end the conflict “almost immediately”. Trump’s remarks may spark alarm among European diplomats eager to avoid a repeat of Zelenskyy’s public humiliation during his last visit to the White House in February when Trump and US Vice President JD Vance accused him of ingratitude and disrespect. As mentioned, the Alaska summit ended with no peace deal, and no arrangements were made for follow-up, working-level meetings, which would have been expected if any agreements had been reached in principle. According to sources close to the matter who spoke to the Reuters news agency, Russia has suggested giving up small pockets of Ukrainian land in return for Ukraine giving it stretches of land in its east.

Article: Volodymyr Zelenskyy will bring heavyweight reinforcements to the White House on Monday — a troop of European leaders likely hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office showdown at a moment of even greater stakes for his country and the continent. Trump accused a waspish Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War 3,” and of disrespecting the White House as the cameras rolled, before cutting the meeting short and telling the Ukrainian leader to come back “when he is ready for peace.” Zelenskyy was in Brussels over the weekend before arriving in Washington as European leaders scrambled to respond to Trump's changing stance. Simon Wohlfahrt / AFP via Getty Images He returns Monday flanked by leaders from Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Finland, plus the heads of the European Union and NATO — a show of solidarity and an effort to ensure Europe has a real voice in peace talks after being excluded from Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska. "It’s a demonstration of European unity and support to Ukraine precisely to avoid what happened in February repeating itself," Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group, told NBC News. He added that the European side would be "eager to prevent Zelenskyy being bullied into making concessions,” after Trump fueled new alarm among Ukraine's allies by appearing to lean toward the Kremlin’s view of things following his talks with Putin. Trump put the onus on Zelenskyy, saying he could “end the war almost immediately, if he wants to,” and that there was “no going into Nato by Ukraine” and “no getting back” the Crimean Peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images This public pressure has fueled fears that he could turn up the heat on Zelenskyy to agree to territorial concessions in exchange for a peace deal. Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals told NBC News. Rahman said the nature of the security guarantees was "absolutely key to prevent Russian aggression in the future," saying the Europeans would travel to Washington hoping to "pin down the detail of what U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s future security will be." Citing a deadly strikes in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, Zelenskyy said Monday that Russia was continuing its attacks on his country even as talks were ongoing in order “to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts.” And in Kyiv, many feel that conceding territory as part of the broader peace deal Trump is now pursuing wouldn’t end the war at all — it would only embolden Moscow to push further. "It is precisely this so-called long-term peace of Putin’s that would allow him to continue waging war," said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a lawmaker for Ukrainian opposition party "European Solidarity." "The quickest step is to establish a ceasefire first, and only then begin negotiations." Europe’s leaders appear to share that instinct. “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday.

Article: In a post on Truth Social Friday morning, the president claimed that the people protesting his decision to leverage hundreds of National Guards members to combat a seemingly unfounded rise in crime were actually paid Democratic agents. Indeed, a couple of months ago, amid protests in the Los Angeles area, Trump railed against “paid insurrectionists,” “professional agitators” and “paid troublemakers” As regular readers might recall, it’s been one of his go-to claims for a long while. Trump assured the public once more that these Americans deserved to be ignored — because, he assumed, they were “paid protesters.” The following year, Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination inspired another round of progressive activism. The protesters, Trump insisted, were “paid professionals.” Earlier this year, as congressional Republicans faced public backlashes at local events, the president assured the public: “Paid ‘troublemakers’ are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Russia’s Vladimir Putin has embraced the same tactic. Let’s instead consider the unavoidable bottom line: For Trump and too many in his party, Americans who disagree with them are effectively an impossibility that can only be explained through corrupt schemes and illicit payments. It’s hardly a stretch to draw a straight line from “paid protesters” rhetoric to election denialism: Americans who side with Trump and Republicans are real, while Americans who disagree must necessarily be seen as inauthentic. Whether the president is prepared to accept this or not, the fact remains that Americans who take to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with him, as happened again over the weekend, don’t need to be compensated: Their outrage is sincere.

But during the past few months of transition planning, NBCUniversal leaders decided MSNBC should take on a new name "to accelerate the distinction between the MSNBC and NBC News organizations," Lazarus wrote in the memo Monday. "This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation." While MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage, such as covering politics, CNBC's news organization is already separate enough from NBC News that executives decided it didn't need a name change, according to people familiar with the matter. MSNBC will soon kick off a national marketing campaign to accompany the launch of the new name, "unlike anything we have done in recent memory," Kutler noted in her memo Monday.

President Trump earlier this month delivered an ultimatum to pharma firms as part of his ongoing campaign to stamp out what he deems as unfair pricing practices in the U.S. list price of its popular treatment from a range of £92 (about $124.57) to £122 a month, depending on the dose size, to between £133 and £330 — a 170% price jump. Several European pharma firms have spoken out in support of the White House's pricing demands, with AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot saying last month that Trump was "right" to push for price equalization. Stanford University's Patel noted that firms like Eli Lilly may also be willing to accede to Trump's pricing demands as they seek coverage for their weight loss drugs under forthcoming changes to the U.S. Novo Nordisk 's Chief Financial Officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said earlier this month that Trump's drug pricing demands had "resonated" with the company and that it was already lowering the price of its Wegovy and Ozempic treatments stateside. markets, there's rather limited history in terms of raising prices … I believe it will be challenging to significantly raise prices outside the U.S.," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." Industry bodies, meanwhile, have warned of the damaging impact sudden prices hikes could have on patient care if implemented to meet Trump's Sept. "Short notice changes to pricing for medicines such as this also have a serious effect on access to an important public health service and pharmacy business themselves," Henry Gregg, chief executive of the U.K.'s National Pharmacy Association, said in a statement.

Article: Median pay among FTSE 100 chief executive officers was £4.58 million ($6.2 million) in the year to March 31, the High Pay Centre found — up from £4.29 million in the 2023-2024 financial year and the highest figure since companies have been required to disclose a single figure for CEO pay, in 2013. That gap is even higher in the U.S., where the bosses of the biggest listed companies made around 290 times that of the average worker in 2023, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute. The High Pay Centre said a total of nine female CEOs served for the entire financial year across the index, with median pay of £3.27 million, below the £4.64 million for companies run for the full year by a man. The U.K.'s highest-paid female executive is widely understood to be Denise Coates, head of online gambling firm Bet365 Group, whose salary totaled £94.66 million last year, according to company accounts. Since 2019, London-listed companies with over 250 employees have had to disclose the ratio between the pay of their CEO and their average worker and make disclosures to justify the salaries of top bosses.

Article: Google has agreed to pay 55 million Australian dollars ($ 35.8m) in fines after the country’s consumer watchdog found it harmed competition by paying the country’s two largest telecommunications companies to pre-install its search application on Android phones, excluding rival search engines. The fine extends a bumpy period for the Alphabet-owned internet giant in Australia, where last week a court mostly ruled against it in a lawsuit brought by Fortnite maker Epic Games, accusing Google and Apple of preventing rival application stores in their operating systems. On anti-competitive tie-ups with Australian telcos, the country’s consumer watchdog on Monday said Google struck deals with Telstra and Optus, under which the tech giant shared with them advertising revenue generated from Google Search on Android devices between late 2019 and early 2021. Google admitted the arrangement had a substantial effect on competition from rival search engines, and has stopped signing similar deals while also agreeing to the fine, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) added. “Today’s outcome … created the potential for millions of Australians to have greater search choice in the future, and for competing search providers to gain meaningful exposure to Australian consumers,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. “We are committed to providing Android device makers more flexibility to pre-load browsers and search apps, while preserving the offerings and features that help them innovate, compete with Apple, and keep costs low,” the spokesperson added.

Article: Though a deal was signed giving the United States access to some of Ukraine’s critical minerals, large disagreements between these parties and Russia continue to stymie the wider peace talks. In the middle, President Donald Trump has often been accused of siding with the latter, suggesting that Russia should keep Crimea as part of a deal he once said would take 24 hours to knock together but has in reality proved far harder. “But it’s not just that somebody was baptized there, or that it was the origin of Russian spirituality,” said Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at London’s Chatham House think tank. “Crimea is a military asset for Russia.” Indeed, Putin himself has described the peninsula as Russia’s “unsinkable aircraft carrier” — turning this erstwhile tourist haven into a garrison of fighter jets and missiles with which to attack Ukraine. It also allowed him to harbor his formidable Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city, and less than 200 miles from both Romania and Turkey, two key NATO members and allies of Washington in the region.

Article: To the extent that Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin was about ending the war in Ukraine, the talks in Alaska were a fiasco for the United States: The Russian leader flew home after scoring a series of easy victories, leading to “pronounced gloating” in Moscow in the wake of Trump’s failure. But it’d be an overstatement to suggest that the American president walked away completely empty-handed: Trump didn’t end the fighting, but he picked up some praise from Putin about the Republican’s own domestic political fights. In his post-summit interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, for example, the Republican declared, “Vladimir said just a little while ago, he said, ‘I’ve never seen anybody do so much so fast.’ He said, ‘Your country is like hot as a pistol.’ And a year ago, he thought it was dead.” Trump similarly cited Putin when attacking mail-in voting — because if there’s one person an American leader should turn to as an authoritative voice on election administration, it’s an unelected foreign dictator. NBC News reported: Putin thanked Trump for the bilateral meeting this afternoon, and said that Trump was correct in saying that his war with Ukraine would not have begun had he been president in 2022 when the war got underway. The Russian leader specifically said, in reference to one of his American counterpart’s claims, “I can confirm it.” Trump, naturally, added soon after that this made him “very happy.” While that reaction is hardly surprising, it’s worth appreciating just how little sense the exchange made. But that was less of a boast than he probably realized: John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, was among many observers who noted that Putin was unlikely to launch a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country during Trump’s tenure because at that point, he already had a White House giving Moscow everything it wanted — and there was no reason to upset that balance with an unnecessary war. But complicating matters further, at the heart of the claim is a dubious assumption: Trump would have the world believe that Putin was so impressed with the awesomeness of Trump’s awesomeness that he wouldn’t have dared to do anything provocative with President Goliath in the White House. Indeed, in Alaska, Trump vouched for Putin’s interest in “peace,” which was soon followed by Russia launching a new round of ballistic missiles and attack drones against Ukraine, killing at least seven people in Kharkiv.

Greece’s conservative government last month suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week. It also marked a further hardening of Greece’s stance towards refugees and migrants under Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s government, which has built a fence at its northern land borders and boosted sea patrols since it came to power in 2019.

Article: WASHINGTON — Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. And the peace must be lasting." European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in Washington are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that “the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." 'A very big move' European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched a total of four Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 140 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight, of which 88 drones were intercepted or jammed.

Article: And it's not medical toggle caption Svetlana Repnitskaya/Getty Images/Moment RF To save the lives of infants and small children living in low- and middle-income countries, there are a handful of tried and tested tools, like anti-malarial drugs, bed nets and vaccines. Infants born to people who received $1,000, no-strings-attached, were nearly half as likely to die as infants born to people who got no cash, according to a report published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Sponsor Message "This paper is really well done, and the result itself is pretty stunning," says Heath Henderson , an economist at Drake University who wasn't involved in the study. "Infant and child mortality in rural Kenya is an order of magnitude higher than it is in the U.S.," says Edward Miguel , an economist at the University of California Berkeley and study co-author. Statistically speaking, that means we need a really large sample size to have precise and reliable estimates of the effect of cash on child mortality." Sponsor Message $1,000 to 10,000 families In 2014, the nonprofit GiveDirectly began a massive experiment. "When I worked in rural parts of Uganda, one of the things that was really clear for pregnant women was they did not attend antenatal care, because it's so difficult to get to a health care facility," says Miriam Laker-Oketta , GiveDirectly's senior research adviser. "You're making the decision between, should I go for antenatal care and have my family sleep hungry, or should I stay home and hope that my baby is fine because I'm not feeling sick and we can have a meal that day," she says, since often women would have to forgo work for a day to go to the doctor. "Those are some of the decisions people have to make." Sponsor Message Extra cash seems to make those decisions easier, as long as health care facilities weren't too far away. "We've given people the means to access the care that they need and not to make some of these really difficult choices between getting care and feeding a family." The extra cash also helped put more food on the table. Women who got cash while pregnant also worked about half as much — roughly 21 fewer hours per week — in their first trimester and the months after delivery than women who didn't get cash. "She's also available after the baby is born to take the child to any early health visits." A 'very important' data point Altogether, the results impressed Aaron Richterman , a physician who studies poverty reduction at the University of Pennsylvania and wasn't involved in the study. Sponsor Message Just how big a difference cash could make may depend, in part, on how readily people in other locations can use the extra money to get health care. "I think this paper underscores the point that it's really adequate access to health care that's making all the difference," said Henderson, the Drake economist and author of the book Poor Relief : Why Giving People Money Is Not The Answer To Global Poverty. "It just so happens that in this particular place, people needed cash to access health care." That's likely the case in many places across sub-Saharan Africa after years of investment in bolstering health care systems, says Laker-Oketta, but not all.

Article: As the next quarterly earnings release approaches, many of the points we made then remain true now, so I encourage a review of that prior article, but because we provided a trade example then, it makes sense to review: how it performed some trade maintenance "best practices" what to do now If you do not review the prior article, this was the trade structure we laid out three months ago: Buy 1 Sept 19 110 call ($5.73 premium) Sell 1 June 27 115 call ($1.51 premium) Sell 1 June 27 84 put ($1.49 premium) That entire structure required an outlay of ~$2.73 in premium. One notices that the calendar spread, which was long the Sep 110 calls and short a nearer-dated June 27 expiration strangle, saw its value increase within the first couple of weeks. Consider that the most a trader could expect to make over the 16 days remaining in the short strangle was just 47 cents, or less than half of 1% of the stock price. As it happens, the strangle did indeed expire worthless, and the only remaining component of the trade, the long September calls are still worth more than the initial structure cost making the trade profitable even if one did nothing. However, one would have done far better by actively managing the trade by rolling the short options, to a longer-dated 16 delta (sometimes abbreviated 16^) strangle such as the July 25 expiration 90/115. That trade had roughly 45 days to expiration and would have collected about $2.43, net of the 47 cents one would have to pay to cover the prior short strangle that would have brought in $1.98 in additional premium. Within the next 18 days, the new short July 25 90/115 strangle would be worth only 46 cents, also having decayed by more than 80% of the value when the trade was initiated, at which point a trader could have rolled the short strangle yet again. The chart below illustrates the difference in the P & L of buying the spread with a "set and forget," versus managing the trade by rolling the short strangles once they have lost more than 80% of their value. In this example, I simply suggest that if you sell a 16 delta (16^) strangle, you roll it once it has decayed by 80%, identifying a new short option of ~16^ with 6-7 weeks until expiration to replace it. 26 weekly 90 puts at $1.38 If the short strangle loses 80% or more of its value, roll the options out to expirations of six weeks or so, selecting strikes of 16-20^. For me, the rule of thumb is 12% annualized, or 1% a month or more, particularly if the underlying stock is highly volatile, is in a volatile industry, or has a lot of debt.

Article: Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani has held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to discuss a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as Israel intensifies its offensive to seize Gaza City. “El-Sisi and the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar stressed the importance of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza,” according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency on Monday. The two leaders “affirmed their rejection of the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of Palestinians”, as Israel plans to seize Gaza City and force Palestinians from the enclave’s main urban centre. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been mediating between Israel and Hamas since the beginning of the war in Gaza that has killed 62,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Efforts by mediators have so far failed to secure a lasting ceasefire in the ongoing war, which over more than 22 months has created a dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said that Qatar’s prime minister was visiting “to consolidate our existing common efforts in order to apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible”. Alluding to the dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip, where United Nations agencies and aid groups have warned of a humanitarian crisis, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching an agreement. ‘Genocides don’t end through negotiated solutions’ Commenting on the Qatari prime minister’s trip to Egypt, Abdullah Al-Arian, an associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar, said it was important to remember that similar negotiations have occurred before, but it is “a lack of Israeli political will” that has ultimately stalled them. Israel “has continued to pursue this genocide and taking it to new, horrific, unprecedented levels”, he told Al Jazeera, adding that there has been a lack of international pressure to secure a ceasefire agreement. “Historically, genocides don’t end through negotiated solutions … They end usually because the party that committed the genocide is forced to end it, usually through external pressure, external intervention of some kind, and that has not happened yet,” the academic stressed. On Monday, human rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza as the UN and aid groups continued to warn of famine in the Palestinian enclave. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” The UN and the international community have been slamming Israel for blocking necessary aid from entering the war-torn enclave.

Article: At the main station in the stronghold city of Kramatorsk, sisters Valentina and Nadia, both in their 70s, wait for a train to escape Russian troops approaching their home in a surrounding area. For more than a decade, the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine — of which Kramatorsk is one of the largest cities still holding out — has been the focal point of intense battles and diplomatic disputes. Pierre Crom / Getty Images For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots. For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force. After Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations. Russia’s conditions to end the war include Ukraine ceding the territories Putin claims — roughly 20% of the country — and agreeing to permanent neutrality, including a ban on joining NATO. While Ukraine is deeply fatigued by the war, about 75% of Ukrainians also object to formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

The 14,154 complaints is the highest number for four years, with many about alleged bullying, abusive behaviour and misogyny - particularly in relation to a divide between some of the girls in the ITV villa. "We also took into account that the format of this reality show is well-established, and viewers would expect to see highs and lows as relationships and friendships are tested." The total number of complaints is higher than the 3,500 in 2024, and is the highest for a summer series since 2021, when 36,000 complaints were submitted. Other issues to attract complaints this year included Dejon Noel-Williams' behaviour towards Megan Moore, while some viewers accused producers of manipulating islanders' emotions and using biased editing, including allegations of racism in the portrayal of Shakira. In response, ITV said: "We would take any suggestion that any editorial decisions are made based on race very seriously indeed and would refute this in the strongest possible terms." Some viewers complained about a decision to bring back Megan Forte Clarke after she was dumped from the villa.

Article: Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall toggle caption Stacey Holman/PBS The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has helped make PBS a home for independent documentaries for more than 50 years. The government's decision to rescind CPB's entire $1.1 billion budget in July, subsequently causing it to announce its closure, led last week to PBS's announcement that it would be reducing its budget by 21%. This on top of sweeping grant cancellations earlier this year at both the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts, which both served as important sources of federal funding for documentarians. Won't stop," said filmmaker Carol Bash, whose 2015 documentary about jazz musician Mary Lou Williams, Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band, was made with public media support. " We're going to continue to find ways to think outside the box to get our films out there to audiences." Sponsor Message Bash said her community is now trying to figure out how to make up for the funding shortfall. (Popular creators can earn revenue through such mechanisms as YouTube's Partner Program and brand deals.) Streaming platform Tubi does occasionally produce or co-produce documentaries, such as When Black Women Go Missing, a 2024 co-production with Vice about the disproportionately high number of Black, female missing persons. "For many documentarians, if you say, 'Are you looking to recoup your investment, or do you want your story to be seen by as many people as possible?' The answer is always both. But ultimately they'll lean toward, 'We just want our content to be seen.'" Sponsor Message The challenges of the open marketplace Indie documentary insiders said it's tough for most indie films to gain visibility in the profit-driven streaming marketplace because they aren't necessarily made for mass audiences. Lozano expects roughly 10 films to lose out on funding this year — a big cut from the up to 40 feature and short documentaries the group typically supports annually. It's an equity issue as much as an artistic one." But for people like Mike Gonzalez, who've fought for decades to stop the flow of federal dollars into public media, there's no reason why these films should get special treatment in the form of federal dollars. A senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, Gonzalez told NPR that PBS — and NPR — needed to be defunded at the federal level owing to "the very biased programming" — a claim both networks' leaders reject. "I don't want to suppress views that are opposite to my own in the least," Gonzalez said, adding that it's simply a matter of independent documentaries vying for eyeballs just like everything else in the content universe. "Maybe this is the opportunity to create a much larger fund specifically for Black stories that is not hampered by the whims of the political movement at the time," said Leslie Fields-Cruz, the executive director of Black Public Media. " IDA is trying to pursue more strategic litigation to see how we can get the support to challenge some of the actions that have been taken at the federal level," said Dominic Willsdon, the IDA's executive director. Sponsor Message " Removing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting out of the media landscape means the world becomes much more impoverished, and the stories that get told will be much more anodyne," said Robb Moss, a documentary filmmaker and professor in Harvard University's department of art, film and visual studies.

Article: But according to Frédérique Carrier, head of investment strategy for RBC Wealth Management in the British Isles and Asia, one pocket of the European market remains overlooked by international investors. "Most of our wealth clients who enquire about Europe have France and Germany in mind, and perhaps Italy and Spain, but few think of the Nordics where macroeconomic trends are encouraging," she said. Pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Zealand Pharma have each shed around 48% so far this year, amid threats from Trump to slap tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical goods. "Denmark is widely seen as a resilient economy, thanks to its low level of indebtedness at the national level (debt to GDP a mere 28% while it enjoys a fiscal surplus of close to 4% of GDP), even as its pharmaceutical sector — which has largely driven growth in the past — is currently in the cross hairs of President Trump's new tariffs strategy," she said in an email. She noted that equity investors looking to allocate to European stocks should take "a highly selective approach to investment." "Our focus would be on high quality companies with a strong business model, a broad international revenue base and robust cash flow generation, an area where the Nordics are particularly well represented," she said. "Such quality does not necessarily come cheap and investors might want to wait for an opportunistic price correction before building positions." 'Unmatched advantage' The Nordic region is rich with opportunities in emerging industries, according to Tor Langøy, founder of London-based investment advisory BD Globe Capital Partners and Viking Digital Campus, a hydro-powered digital corporate campus on Norway's west coast. Brookfield Asset Management, which manages assets worth more than $1 trillion, announced in June it would allocate up to 95 billion Swedish krona ($10 billion) to support the development of AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced at the end of July that it would spearhead a multibillion-dollar data center project in Norway that would deliver 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units by the end of 2026. "[It boasts the] lowest electricity costs in Europe, powered by 100% renewable hydropower, accelerated grid connection timelines, enabling faster go-to-market, [and] supportive, pro–data center government policies that welcome strategic infrastructure investment." He argued that Norway will "continue to lead" thanks to its energy security, connectivity resilience and geopolitical stability. "As the world leader in mobile network technology, Ericsson is well positioned to capitalize on its strong market positions and find new growth avenues over time," AB Investor's President and CEO Christian Cederholm, said in the firm's second-quarter earnings report. "While we operate in an unpredictable world, I remain confident in Investor's and our companies' ability to generate attractive long-term total returns." Cederholm later told CNBC that there were also opportunities in the Nordic region's private markets. "So we're not bargain hunters, we're in this for the long term … on the positive side, I would say that between our focus markets, which are the Nordics and North America, there are a really good investment opportunities." — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

Article: The brigades were called in by Ayad Kadhim Ali after he was dismissed as the head of the ministry’s office in Baghdad’s Karkh district, according to Mehmet Alaca, an expert on Iraq’s Shia militias. Proponents of the bill argue it would incentivise the PMF to act within the confines of the law, but detractors fear it would give legal cover to militias, which are already too strong. The group received Iranian support to become a major powerbroker in Iraq and later intervened in Syria’s civil war to support then-President Bashar al-Assad as he tried to crush a popular rebellion. Advertisement Kataib Imam Ali is another, albeit smaller, group in the PMF that reportedly received training from the Lebanese group Hezbollah in Iran and also dispatched fighters to Syria during the height of its war. Like Kataib Imam Ali, most PMF factions were formed after Iraqi Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani issued a fatwa in 2014, urging all able-bodied men to join the state to defend Iraq from ISIL (ISIS). But the law lacks clarity around command and control and budgetary oversight, and it has failed to prevent some groups from taking unilateral action to attack United States assets and soldiers stationed in the country. While the figure is small relative to the $21.1bn allocated to Iraq’s Ministry of Defence that same year, it is a sizeable amount that the state allocated to a body that it did not even have an accurate membership list for. Over the past 10 years, PMF factions have created political wings, run in parliamentary elections and gained access to lucrative state money after securing important administrative positions in key ministries. In 2021, PMF groups linked to Iran launched a drone at the home of then-Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, reportedly an attempt to upend the government after losing many parliamentary seats and thus access to state money in the recent elections, said Alaca, the expert on Iraqi Shia militias. It would give all PMF factions official, stable employment and bring them under the control of Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani as commander-in-chief Proponents of the draft law mainly include a bloc of five Shia parties known as the Coordination Framework. “The argument pushed by those advocating for the law is that by offering an institutional safe haven for armed factions under a reformed PMF, it would incentivise those to comply with the national chain of command – thereby diminishing their appetite to take action outside the state,” explained Inna Rudolf, an expert on the PMF and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Statecraft & National Security at King’s College London. During the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, PMF groups did not attack US assets or personnel, likely out of fear of giving Israel a pretext to attack their command structure and resources as Israel did against Hezbollah, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute. “I would say that the stronger and more embedded PMF groups are the ones who have been practising restraint and telling the smaller [pro-Iran] factions not to get involved in the regional conflict [between Iran and Israel],” Mansour said. The follow-up on the Ministry of Agriculture incident will test the willingness of PMF commanders to cooperate with the state to hold their own members accountable, as well as the state’s seriousness in holding PMF members accountable, according to Rudolf. “Sudani’s administration wants to demonstrate power over the PMF and [to prove] that everyone affiliated with it not only has the same privileges as members of the security forces but has to abide by the same code of conduct,” Rudolf told Al Jazeera. As a result, civil society is wary of seeing all PMF factions given the same privileges as Iraq’s army and police and would prefer the government absorb only those that do not have close ties with Iran, al-Kinani said. Advertisement US officials are also pressuring Iraq not to pass the law with Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly telling al-Sudani the law would “institutionalise Iranian influence and armed terrorist groups undermining Iraq’s sovereignty”.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers said they had returned to the state Monday after a two-week absence that temporarily blocked Republican leaders from enacting a plan aimed at padding their party's majority in the U.S. The legislators decided to end their standoff after they prevented Texas Republicans from passing a redrawn congressional map during a first special legislative session and after California Democrats countered with their own redistricting proposal. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu said in a statement. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying Republicans pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday. The issue became a national rallying cry for Democrats, amid their argument that President Donald Trump and national Republicans were pursuing a power grab to insulate themselves from potential political peril in next year's midterm elections. But Democrats have been fiercely critical of those accusations, arguing the Legislature could have dispatched with bipartisan flood relief first, and only waited to hold the issue as hostage to compel Democrats to return. During Friday morning's final meeting of the first special House session, the House had 95 of the 100 members necessary to move forward, meaning that it would take the return of a only few Democrats to allow the House to go back into session.

Article: President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss how to end Russia’s three-year war in Ukraine. After that summit, Trump abandoned the requirement of reaching a ceasefire in order to hold further talks and aligned with Putin’s position that negotiations should focus on a long-term settlement instead. WATCH: Trump meets Putin in Alaska with future of Ukraine war hanging in balance The presence of several European leaders at the talks in Washington shows how central the conflict — and any settlement — is to wider security questions on the continent. They are looking to safeguard Ukraine and Europe more broadly from any further aggression from Moscow — but also are providing a show of support for Zelenskyy after his last visit to the White House led to an angry confrontation. On “Trump’s ultimate policy towards the Russia-Ukraine war hangs not just the future of Ukraine security, but Europe’s as well,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A lot of issues need to be resolved, however, and the two sides have previously established red lines that are incompatible, including questions of whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine’s army and whether the country will have any guarantee against further Russian aggression. Putin wants the Donbas As a condition for peace, the Russian leader wants Kyiv to give up the Donbas, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the most intense fighting but that Russian forces have failed to capture completely. As part of a deal, Putin has said the United States and its European allies can provide Ukraine with a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense pledge, according to a senior U.S. READ MORE: Putin agreed to let U.S., Europe offer Ukraine NATO-like security protections, Trump envoy says Trump envoy Steve Witkoff called that a “game-changing” step though he offered few details on how it would work. Ukraine won’t surrender land to Russia Zelenskyy has rejected Putin’s demand that Ukraine surrender the Donbas region, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, since the Ukrainian Constitution forbids giving up territory or trading land. Europe’s security is also at stake in the talks European leaders see Ukraine’s fight as a bulwark against any Kremlin ambitions to threaten other countries in eastern Europe and beyond. French President Emmanuel Macron described Ukraine as an “outpost of our collective defense if Russia wanted to advance again.” “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” Macron said Sunday. The European political heavyweights expected in Washington are Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Civilians are killed as the fighting continues Ukraine has in recent months been losing more territory against Russia’s bigger army, and Moscow’s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of minor infiltrations in the Donetsk region ahead of the Alaska summit.

Article: A surviving roommate who encountered the masked intruder who slaughtered four University of Idaho students in an off-campus home in 2022 initially told investigators she heard an unknown male voice refer to a victim by her name. Amid the rampage, roommate Dylan Mortensen said she had opened her door and "heard a male say, 'It's OK Kaylee, I'm here for you,' and crying," according to a newly unsealed document written by Idaho State Police trooper Jeffory Talbot, based on a briefing received from a police sergeant in Moscow, Idaho. Investigators used DNA found on the button of a knife sheath left behind the room where Goncalves and Mogen were killed to help tie the attack to Bryan Kohberger, then a criminology Ph.D. Mortensen later adjusted what she told police after gathering "additional information," and said she believed it was Kernodle who had been crying in a bathroom, according to the documents, adding, "She advised she knows the male's voice was not Ethan's voice."

One professor warned colleagues that Kohberger "is smart enough that in four years, we will have to give him a Ph.D." "Mark my word, I work with predators, if we give him a Ph.D., that's the guy that in many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing" students, the professor said. A fellow student who spoke with police said she had a conversation with Kohberger after the murders and he told her that "whoever committed the homicides must have been pretty good." And, according to the student, Kohberger said the timing of the killings just before the start of winter break "made it a good choice." Kohberger declined to speak at his sentencing.

Article: WASHINGTON — Russia's illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 was quick and bloodless, and it sent Moscow's relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War. Putin has called the peninsula “a sacred place” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine — particularly the Crimean Tatars, who strongly opposed the annexation. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court’s finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it. A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin called its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin’s prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022, in July 2023 and in June 2025. Those also include Ukraine ceding the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022, dropping its bid to join NATO, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population.

Article: Soho House bought for £2bn as Ashton Kutcher joins board Just now Share Save Karen Hoggan Business Reporter Share Save Getty Images Ashton Kutcher will join the Soho House board Private members' club chain Soho House has been snapped up for $2.7bn (£2bn) by a consortium involving Hollywood actor turned investor Ashton Kutcher. The group opened its first club in London in 1995, and now has 46 Soho Houses in Europe, North America and Asia, as well a string of other up-market hospitality businesses. It is widely regarded as being a popular haunt of A-list celebrities, and one of its London venues was reportedly where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had their first date. But since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 the value of its shares has dropped sharply, as it struggled to make a profit amid a sense that it had lost the exclusivity it once had. The consortium is led by MCR Hotels, the third-biggest US hotel group, whose high profile properties include the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport in New York and the BT Tower in London. "We have long admired Soho House for bringing together cultures from around the world into a global network of 46 houses, and we look forward to the continued growth of that fabric, starting with four new houses opening soon." Reuters The first Soho House, opened by Mr Jones, was in London's Greek Street above his restaurant, Cafe Boheme. However, this expansion had resulted in accusations that Soho House was no longer as exclusive as members would expect given its membership fee, which can run into several thousand pounds. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while Soho House "can now boast a Hollywood star as a director", the chain would need "a bit more than celebrity stardust to cement its long-term future". "MCR Hotels, Ashton Kutcher and the other investors will have their work cut out to put Soho House back onto a more stable footing given concerns about the viability of its business model," she said. "Its rapid expansion in recent years has sparked concerns that its 'exclusive' label was wearing thin." She said it was a "challenging time" for the restaurant business, with "aspirational shoppers tightening their stylish belts".

Article: AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats say they are ending a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts to satisfy President Donald Trump’s demands for a greater GOP advantage. WATCH: ‘Stop the insanity’: Texas Democrat urges GOP to end redistricting battle The nation’s two most populous states have been at the forefront of a national fight to reshape the congressional landscape ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Trump has sought to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny the GOP majority the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Washington. California Democrats, who hold supermajorities in both chambers — enough to act without any Republican votes — on Friday unveiled a proposal that could give Democrats there an additional five U.S.

Article: fired all of the members of an influential vaccine panel earlier this summer, he said the committee was “plagued with persistent conflicts of interest.” But new research, published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, finds that the two major vaccine advisory committees have had record-low conflicts of interest for nearly the past decade. Kennedy has long held that members of the vaccine advisory panels to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration maintain close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. “When he started citing these big statistics like 97%, I thought, ‘Wow, that’s really big,’” said lead study author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy. “When I started looking at the vaccine data, I wasn’t really seeing those kinds of numbers.” The study looked at how common conflicts of interest were over the last two decades for members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Kanter said that in the early 2000s, conflicts of interest on the committees were much higher — peaking at 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007. But starting around 2007 and 2012, members of the FDA’s VRBPAC started to undergo a more stringent vetting process, including requirements to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist, Kanter said. “You do want people who have done the clinical research on safety and efficacy.” She added that her previous research has shown that people who have financial ties to the competitor of any given product being discussed often don’t vote any differently than people who have no financial ties. In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “Secretary Kennedy is committed to eliminating both real and perceived conflicts to strengthen confidence in public health decisions.” ​​Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said it’s important for advisory panels to maintain low conflicts of interest because it helps prevent “skewed decision-making.” After Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP, he replaced them with eight new appointees, including several well-known vaccine critics. “They believe in a grand conspiracy where pharma controls the media and government, so for them, for example, an NIH grant would be a conflict of interest, or working in a health care organization.” Several of Kennedy’s new appointees, however, have ties to anti-vaccine groups or have served as expert witnesses in vaccine-related lawsuits, testifying on behalf of the plaintiffs suing vaccine makers. Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, said he wasn’t surprised by the new study's findings, noting that it’s common practice for committee members to recuse themselves from voting if a conflict arises.

Article: European leaders rush to US to help Ukraine avoid 'capitulation' 7 minutes ago Share Save James Landale • @BBCJLandale Diplomatic correspondent Share Save Reuters Starmer and Macron - pictured with Zelensky in May - are among the European leaders travelling to Washington on Monday European leaders may have rushed to Washington ostensibly to throw a protective arm around President Zelensky and head off any repeat of February's Oval Office bust-up. But their real aim is to stop US President Donald Trump threatening long-term European security after his abrupt change of course over how best to end the war in Ukraine. Not only did Trump drop calls for a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks about long-term peace, he also - diplomats say - made clear he had no intention of imposing further economic sanctions on Russia. President Macron of France was the latest to use the C word, saying on Sunday: "There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia." Follow live updates on this story It takes a great deal for heads of government to upend their schedules at short notice – especially in August – when some are on holiday. But such was the scale of President Trump's change of strategy after meeting President Putin – and the consequent potential threat to Europe – that the European leaders changed their plans fast. Our question is what are we trying to achieve here?" They added: "The European position has long been that Putin needs to show a genuine desire to get around a table and stop the war, and that would involve a ceasefire. That means convincing Trump of two things: one, that questions about territory and security guarantees cannot be separated, and two, that security guarantees must be about more than verbal or textual promises. That's not good enough for Ukraine or us." Reuters Trump dropped calls for a ceasefire as a condition for talks about long-term peace after meeting Putin in Alaska last week

Article: Starmer offers support and pragmatism ahead of Ukraine meeting 3 hours ago Share Save Joe Pike Political correspondent Share Save PA Media President Zelensky visited Downing Street last week, just as President Trump was preparing to meet Russia's President Putin In all of Sir Keir Starmer's interventions on a possible Ukrainian peace process, there seems to be a significant gap between his careful public pronouncements and more pragmatic private views. Sir Keir has not said it explicitly but I am told the UK government privately accepts the premise of "land for peace" - Ukraine ceding territory as part of a peace deal with Russia. Secondly, Keir Starmer and his European colleagues want to flesh out details of what they hope will be "ironclad" security guarantees - measures to protect and defend Ukraine in the event a peace deal is struck. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff's recent endorsement of these proposed security guarantees as "game changing" is seen in No 10 as proof that months of work on Starmer and Macron's 'coalition of the willing' is finally paying off. We've got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just." But what exactly will Donald Trump contribute? Keir Starmer's calculation seem to be that for now he should be supportive and pragmatic, even if his hostility and scepticism towards Vladimir Putin does not seem to be shared by the US president.

Article: 21 minutes ago Share Save Tom Edgington and Nick Eardley BBC Verify correspondent Share Save Getty Images As Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at the White House for talks aimed at ending the war, the scale of United States (US) support is once again under the spotlight. BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution. The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, according to the Kiel Institute, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine. Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed: "We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference" Getty Images BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and concluded Trump's numbers did not add up as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn. Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations. This prompted Macron - who was sat next the US president in the Oval Office at the time - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans. How much has the UK given to Ukraine The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

Article: Soho House is going private in a $2.7 billion deal led by New York-based MCR Hotels, capping a turbulent market run and financial struggles that erased nearly half of the high-end members club operator's value since its 2021 debut. Actor and tech investor Ashton Kutcher will also be joining Soho's board following the deal, and the company named hospitality veteran Neil Thomson as chief financial officer to succeed Thomas Allen effective immediately. Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, whose firm Third Point invested in Soho House, and who has been pushing for a "fair" sales process, on Monday told Reuters he is pleased with the planned move and supports the deal.

With Powell's speech on Friday morning, Director of Portfolio Analysis Jeff Marks noted that the big debate is whether Powell will tee up a September interest rate cut or focus instead on providing a longer-term monetary policy framework. In particular, we're looking for confirmation that Palo Alto's blockbuster CyberArk acquisition was not executed because its core business is slowing down — that's been a key prong of the bear case against the deal.

Article: Russian attacks on major Ukrainian cities have killed at least 12 people as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, DC, supported by European leaders, for high-stakes peace talks with United States President Donald Trump that could determine Ukraine’s future and its fate in the war, now in its fourth year. An entire family, including a toddler and a 16-year-old, were among seven people killed in an overnight drone strike on a residential neighbourhood in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, authorities said on Monday. Russian forces killed five people and injured four in attacks in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, where some of the fiercest fighting on the ground rages on and where Russian President Vladimir Putin, feeling Moscow has the upper hand, seeks Ukraine’s withdrawal from the third of the region Kyiv still controls. According to the United Nations monitoring mission on Ukraine, about 2,600 drone attacks were recorded in the past month, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, and more than 300 civilians were killed. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said on Monday that its drones had struck an oil-pumping station in the Tambov region, a strike 1,923km (1,195 miles) from Ukraine, leading to the suspension of supplies via the Druzhba pipeline. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said Zelenskyy saw the killing of civilians as a strategy aimed at giving Trump more bargaining chips with which to pressure Ukraine into accepting an unfavourable peace deal. It is also forbidden under the Ukrainian Constitution, The meeting comes on the heels of a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that ended with no clear breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Bell said a “catalyst” was needed to bring the war to a close, the most effective of which he believed to be Trump’s stiff tariffs on buyers of Russian oil and gas, like India. Advertisement Strength and safety in numbers appear to be factors in the group visit by European leaders with memories still fresh about the hostile reception Zelenskyy received in February from Trump and US Vice President JD Vance in a public White House dressing-down.

Article: CLEVELAND — Isaiah Bond, a rookie wide receiver who went undrafted after being arrested for sexual assault, has signed a contract with the Cleveland Browns just days after a grand jury in Texas declined to file charges. “We’ve spent much of the last calendar year getting to know Isaiah as a player and professional and much of the last four months gaining a full understanding of his legal situation," said Browns GM Andrew Berry in a statement released by the team. After his release, Bond said on social media that the accusation against him was "patently false." He later filed a federal lawsuit against the woman who made the accusation, which included a defamation claim. Last week, Collin County (Texas) District Attorney Greg Willis announced that the sexual assault case against Bond was no-billed by a grand jury, and he faces no further criminal charges. The full statement, which was posted to X, can be viewed below: In his statement, Bond addressed recent allegations, saying he has "refuted these allegations and maintained [his] innocence" and thanked the legal system for deciding not to pursue charges. "On the legal side, we have done extensive research that includes but is not limited to hearing from both sides of the case and receiving the results of an independently administered polygraph test," Berry added.

Article: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is visiting Armenia for talks on a planned corridor linking Azerbaijan near the border with his country, days after Iran said it would block the project included in a United States-brokered peace accord that puts a potential Washington presence on Iran’s doorstep. The land corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (TRIPP), is part of a deal signed earlier this month in Washington between former foes Armenia and Azerbaijan. Before departing for the Armenian capital Yerevan on Monday, Pezeshkian described the possible presence of American companies in the region as “worrying.” “We will discuss it [with Armenian officials] and express our concerns,” he told state television. Tehran has long opposed the planned transit route, also known as the Zangezur corridor, fearing it would cut the country off from Armenia and the rest of the Caucasus while bringing potentially hostile foreign forces close to its borders. Since the deal was signed on August 8, Iranian officials have stepped up warnings to Armenia, saying the project could be part of a US ploy “to pursue hegemonic goals in the Caucasus region”. “They [Armenian officials] have assured us that no American forces … or American security companies will be present in Armenia under the pretext of this route,” he told the official IRNA news agency. Trump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News soon after the deal was signed, adding that the area would become “a graveyard for Trump’s mercenaries”. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.

Article: The government of the United Kingdom has warned Irish novelist Sally Rooney against funding Palestine Action after she pledged support to the campaign group banned by the Labour-led government as a “terrorist” group last month. “There is a difference between showing support for a proscribed organisation, which is an offence under the Terrorism Act, and legitimate protest in support of a cause,” a spokesperson was quoted by PA Media. In an opinion piece in the Irish Times on Saturday, Rooney, the author of best-selling novels such as Normal People and Conversations with Friends, criticised the government’s move to ban the pro-Palestinian group. Palestine Action was banned after its activists broke into a military base in central England in June and sprayed red paint on two planes in protest against the UK’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Rooney said she chose the Dublin-based newspaper to publicise her intention rather than a UK one as doing so “would now be illegal” in Britain after the government banned Palestine Action. I want to be clear that I intend to use these proceeds of my work, as well as my public platform generally, to go on supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can,” she wrote. The spokesperson from the prime minister’s office said Palestine Action was proscribed “based on security advice following serious attacks the group has committed, following an assessment made by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre”. The government ban on Palestine Action came into force on July 5, days after it took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.3m) of damage to two aircraft. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the proscription of the group, stating: “UK national security and public safety must always be our top priority.” Advertisement “The assessments are very clear – this is not a nonviolent organisation,” she said. In her article, Rooney accused the UK government of “willingly stripping its own citizens of basic rights and freedoms, including the right to express and read dissenting opinions, in order to protect its relationship with Israel”.

Article: How you're using AI at work right now YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP via Getty Images On The Indicator's recent Jobs Friday episode, we told a few stories of how you all are using AI on the job. A high school teacher creates custom lessons, like an AI-generated pop song about monopolies and a Keynesian chatbot; A wedding photographer makes unwanted tables and exit signs disappear from her client's photos, but has to keep an eye out for creepy mistakes; A software engineer told us how AI is both boosting his productivity and triggering anxiety. We couldn't fit all the insightful, surprising, useful and unsettling ways you are using AI at work into one episode of The Indicator, so we've collected a few more use cases for you here. Overall, a portrait emerges: While many of you say AI is a time-saver, sometimes freeing you up for more face-to-face work, it also makes mistakes that beg for careful (and time-consuming) oversight. (Some of you even used AI to email us — check out listener Paul Elder's conversation with Gemini about emailing us, which he gave us permission to share here.) "Make this sound better" is Nick Messina's go-to prompt whenever he writes a proposal as a civil engineer in Portland, Maine. "I have to dial it back to make it sound more like the words of an engineer rather than a marketing influencer." He also uses AI to summarize reports, but has run into some trouble with that use. Freeing up time for human work The budget at the public library in Norwood, Colorado — population 526 — where Erin Dann works is "razor thin." So, the 46-year-old, who is tasked with designing programs for all ages, has outsourced some of that work to AI. "I usually heavily edit whatever AI spits out," Erin wrote, "but even just having an outline to work from is very helpful." Role play Jeffrey Anvari-Clark, a 47-year-old listener in Grand Forks, North Dakota, has been using AI to get more done as an assistant professor of social work. German is not Genevieve's native language, so AI helps her write letters of congratulations to people who have accomplished certain items from a list of dozens of possibilities in the language. She's trained the LLM she works with to accept a 'yes-or-no' checklist of accomplishments, then rephrase everything with a 'flowery congratulations.' Genevieve has to look over the letters before she sends them, though — occasionally, it adds a sentence referring to a previous candidate. Paul runs every AI-generated script through a different AI for "independent review." Once, an AI returned him a script with a "severe error that could have caused a system-wide meltdown." The near-catastrophe reinforced an important lesson for Paul: AI is not a replacement for human expertise. "I must understand my job, the systems, and the potential risks." Not everyone finds it time saving to have AI help, including Lynn Pepin, a 29 year-old software engineer in Connecticut. "Even when these tools do things right (and they increasingly do!), I spend more mental energy going over the generated code with a fine-tuned comb than I would writing it myself." And more … Thanks to everyone who wrote to us about how you use AI at work.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: Putin’s revised ask — the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, often referred to as the Donbas — has been interpreted by Washington as a concession, even though the original proposal had been laughable to U.S. Witkoff said Russia previously demanded the entirety of all five regions in Ukraine that the Kremlin had declared annexed, including Crimea, up to the administrative borders, but “the Russians made some concessions at the table.” Mr. Putin agreed that the United States and its Western allies could provide security guarantees to Ukraine, along the lines of NATO’s Article 5, so long as Ukraine wasn’t admitted to the alliance. But at the time, Moscow also tried to insert a clause that would have given the Kremlin veto power over an international response in the event of a new invasion, a deal breaker for Ukraine. But critics quickly seized on the Kremlin’s history of disregarding Russia’s own laws, including a Constitution that, among other things, guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of the press, both of which Mr.

Article: The major averages finished last week on a high note , after the latest inflation data suggested higher pricing pressures in some parts of the economy that nevertheless wasn't so severe as to take a September rate cut off the table. On Friday, Fabio Bassi, head of cross-asset strategy at JP Morgan, told investors to brace themselves for incoming volatility, especially if macroeconomic data continues to come in weaker than expected. Investors are questioning the catalysts for a correction in risk assets, when the Fed is 'coming to the rescue' and the outlook in 2026 looks rosier," Bassi wrote in a note titled "Estote Parati: Calm Markets Can Precede Volatility." "Estote Parati" is a Latin phrase that translates to "Be Prepared." "However, investors should not be complacent," he continued. "Bad macro news so far has been perceived as good news for risk assets given shallow and temporary weakness cushioned by the 'Fed put'; however, bad news could turn truly detrimental if macro weakness appears large or persistent." Bassi said he does not hold a recession in his base case, but he nevertheless worries that downside risk has grown especially after the market's major runup this year. Many market observers point out that the S & P 500, which is currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is priced for perfection and could be due for a pullback. Bassi expects a 5% to 10% pullback is in the cards, which would knock the S & P 500 back down to about 5,800 or 6,000, from around 6,450 where it was last. "In the short term, we expect growth risks to come to the forefront for investors, as the impact of tariffs gets reflected in prices and consumer spending, amid a retracement for the large frontloading of the first half of the year," Bassi wrote.

Article: Darryl George's case against Barbers Hill ISD dismissed and sex discrimination claim proceeds A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed claims of racial discrimination while allowing claims of sex discrimination to proceed in a federal civil rights lawsuit regarding a Texas student who has faced suspensions and disciplinary actions over the length of his locs hairstyle. District Court Judge Jeffrey Vincent Brown said in his decision that the claims of racial discrimination in the lawsuit brought by Darryl George, a student at Barbers Hill High School, and his family "have not shown a persistent, widespread practice of disparate, race-based enforcement" of the hair policy. "At most, the plaintiffs allege only two instances: the allegations underlying George's case and those underlying the Arnold case also pending in this court," Brown said, referencing another case of a Black teen who was suspended over his hair. "But these two instances alone are insufficient to establish a pattern of conduct going on 'for so long or so frequently' that it evinces a 'persistent, widespread practice.'" Regarding the claims of sex discrimination, Brown said while the school district gives reasons that show why they have a dress code, "they provide no support for the narrower question that forms the basis of this claim: what is the rationale for the dress code's distinction between male and female students?" RELATED: Judge sides with Barbers Hill ISD in hair discrimination trial involving high school student "Because the district does not provide any reason for the sex-based distinctions in its dress code, the claim survives this initial stage," Brown said. The judge dismissed all of the family's other claims, including infringement of George's First Amendment free expression rights and request for "compensatory damages and injunctive and declaratory relief" for claims of "mental anguish." CNN has reached out to George's attorneys for comment. Barbers Hill Independent School District Superintendent Greg Poole said in a statement Wednesday that the decision to dismiss the racial claims "validates what our district has maintained throughout this ordeal ... high expectations for all students in all things are not racist." "Our policies and our procedures for 95 years have been established by our community via a locally elected board of trustees. Having high expectations for all students in all things is why we are one of the highest achieving districts in the state, and it is why parents of all ethnicities continue to move to our district in record numbers," Poole wrote. "Our district will not succumb to a cancerous cancel culture that seeks to intimidate, falsely accuse, and use race in a disingenuous way to serve a political end." RELATED: A Black student punished for his hairstyle wants to return to the Texas school he left The ruling comes months after a separate federal judge ruled the state's CROWN Act - a law that prohibits discrimination against hair texture and protective hairstyles like locs and braids that are "commonly or historically associated with race" - does not make it unlawful for school dress codes to limit a student's hair length, meaning it did not violate state law for the district to continue punishing George for the length of his locs hairstyle. George and his family were seeking an injunction against Abbott and Paxton to compel them to stop the school district from "exposing BHISD and Texas students to disciplinary punishment and disciplinary measures due to locs, braids, twists, and other protective styles that are alleged to be or that are longer than the District or schools' length requirement." Brown, in his decision, also dismissed the claims against Abbott and Paxton. Attorneys for Abbott and Paxton had argued for dismissal, citing claims of immunity from lawsuits and saying they do not have "enforcement authority under the CROWN Act, nor do they have a general duty to intervene when a public school district is merely accused of violating a student's constitutional rights or rights provided under a provision of State law." CNN has reached out to attorneys for Abbott and Paxton for comment.

Article: Two months into his second term as president, Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order intended to overhaul dramatically how elections are administered in the United States, taking aim at everything from voter registration requirements to election equipment to mail-in ballot deadlines. Election experts said that Trump was claiming power he does not have and that lawsuits over the measure were all but guaranteed.” Predictably, the executive order faced immediate legal challenges, and a federal judges blocked the Republican’s outlandish power grab from going forward. NBC News reported: Trump said in a post to Truth Social that he would sign an executive order to try to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines, a move that would almost certainly face immediate challenges in court. The 288-word online tantrum — complete with six exclamation points, a robust number of sentences written with the caps lock on and the word “woke” — was remarkable in its inanity. But the Republican, who’s become increasingly unsubtle about his authoritarian ambitions, also made clear that he’s eyeing yet another power grab, claiming an administrative authority over elections that the Constitution explicitly gives to states. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.” As part of the same tirade, the president added, “WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT ...

Article: Around this time five years ago, Belarus’ Aleksandr Lukashenko named himself the winner of a rigged presidential election, extending a tenure that began in 1994, and held a secret inauguration ceremony. The path forward should be a national dialogue leading to the Belarusian people enjoying their right to choose their leaders in a free and fair election under independent observation.” A lot can happen in five years, however. While the Trump’s team in his first term made a rather obvious diplomatic call by rejecting an illegitimate election in a country led one of Vladmir Putin’s regional puppets, things are far different in the American president’s second term. Bloomberg reported: US President Donald Trump spoke with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, a Kremlin ally under a range of international sanctions, in a rare direct call ahead of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. We discussed many topics, including President Putin’s visit to Alaska.’ The Republican added, in reference to the Belarusian leader his administration refused to acknowledge as legitimate five years earlier, “I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future.” I won’t pretend to know whether Trump intended for this online missive to be significant, but it raised a few eyebrows for a few reasons. Aliyev, who’s been repeatedly accused by international observers of being a dictator, replied, “It’s been 22 years.” The American president, clearly impressed, said, “Twenty-two years, that’s pretty good.” At that point, Trump turned to attendees and added, “That means he’s tough and smart.” It was a timely reminder: The Republican doesn’t admire dictators despite their despotism, he admires them because of their despotism. The American has also celebrated North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as an “absolute leader” and praised China’s Xi Jinping as a “brilliant man” who controls 1.4 billion people with an “iron fist.” As Election Day 2024 approached, Trump told voters, “It’s nice to have a strongman running the country,” adding, “Sometimes you need a strongman.” With this in mind, his praise for Lukashenko was ridiculous — but hardly out of character.

Article: Rodrigo Paz, and a right-wing former president, Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, will face off in October after a first round of voting knocked out candidates allied with the nation’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party. Paz, a former mayor, campaigned with the slogan “Capitalism for all” — rejecting the statist policies of MAS while pitching a more inclusive approach to rescuing Bolivia from its worst economic crisis in four decades. “The vast majority of people have expressed that desire for renewal — merchants, the self-employed, transport workers, the great majority of this country.” Paz had been trailing in opinion polls for weeks. But he gained unexpected traction as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing who was fired for denouncing corruption in the security services. “We did not invest millions, we invested in the people’s trust,” Lara told local media on Monday, seeking to portray his ticket as a humble alternative to that of the wealthy right-wingers who poured exorbitant sums into campaigning. “While others spent fortunes on posters and TV spots, we trusted in the strength of the citizens and a message of unity.” Paz secured a lead over Quiroga with over 32% of the votes cast. “Now, the ball is in the hands of the Bolivian people,” said leftist President Luis Arce, who will leave office following plummeting approval ratings reflecting popular frustration with his government’s mismanagement of the economy. “Democracy has triumphed!” A shift away from decades of leftist party rule The results delivered a blow to Bolivia’s hegemonic MAS party, which has governed almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leaders who swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country’s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs. READ MORE: Bolivia’s economic turmoil fuels distrust in government and its claim of a failed coup Annual inflation rate has soared from 2% less than two years ago to 25% as of last month. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades, even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite. Followers of Morales heed calls to vote null Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president. Whisked away by guards, Rodríguez later called it a “difficult moment.” A centrist draws leftists wary of a right-wing lurch Paz’s victory came as a shock, as opinion polls had long suggested that Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina would be the top two contenders. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. “People wanted something new, and, after not finding that in a radical on the right or someone who fully represented socialism, they have obviously opted for Paz,” said Álvaro Chipana, who was strolling Monday in the affluent southern part of Bolivia’s capital of La Paz. a former president Paz’s supporters have described the former mayor Bolivia’s southern town of Tarija as a fresh face with new ideas, in contrast to Doria Medina and Quiroga, who served in the U.S.-backed neoliberal administrations that Morales repudiated when he stormed to office in 2006, declaring an end to Bolivia’s 20-year experiment with free-market capitalism.

Article: Texas House Democrats confirmed on Monday morning that they are returning to Austin after a two-week standoff with Republicans over proposed congressional maps, potentially clearing the way for Republicans to approve changes that could net Republicans as many as five new House seats next year. The Democrats did not confirm any specific action they plan to take on or off the House floor, but they say that they are going to build a "legal case against the discriminatory map". "We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation -- reshaping the entire 2026 landscape," Democratic Caucus chair state Rep. "We're returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans' plans than when we left." After the Texas state legislature began a second special legislative session on Friday and failed still to meet quorum, Republican legislators are expected to try for a quorum Monday and then to work to advance proposed new congressional maps, which will have to once again pass through the House's redistricting committee and procedural votes. Gavin Newsom formally announced plans to get new congressional maps to go before voters in November in a counter to Texas, the state legislature will convene on Monday from recess and is set to rapidly work on passing legislation to get the maps on the ballot.

The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah’s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides. Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst and founder of the Israeli think tank Alma Research and Education Center, said UNIFIL has played a “damaging role with regard to the mission of disarming Hezbollah in south Lebanon.” She pointed to the discovery of Hezbollah tunnels and weapons caches close to UNIFIL facilities during and after last year’s Israel-Hezbollah war, when much of the militant group’s senior leadership was killed and much of its arsenal destroyed. Khalil Helou said that if UNIFIL’s mandate were to abruptly end, soldiers would need to be pulled away from the porous border with Syria, where smuggling is rife, or from other areas inside of Lebanon — “and this could have consequences for the stability” of the country.

Article: President Donald Trump walked into a summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin pressing for a ceasefire deal and threatening “severe consequences” and tough new sanctions if the Kremlin leader failed to agree to halt the fighting in Ukraine U.S. ((Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump walked into a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin pressing for a ceasefire deal and threatening “severe consequences” and tough new sanctions if the Kremlin leader failed to agree to halt the fighting in Ukraine. After calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote as he flew home from Friday's meeting in Alaska that it had been “determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” It was a dramatic reversal that laid bare the challenges of dealing with Putin, a cunning adversary, as well as the complexities of a conflict that Trump had repeatedly boasted during his campaign that he could solve within 24 hours. While European leaders were relieved that Trump did not agree to a deal that ceded territory or otherwise favored Moscow, the summit allowed Putin to reclaim his place on the world stage and may have bought Russia more time to push forward with its offensive in Ukraine. “We’re back to where we were before without him having gone to Alaska,” said Fiona Hill, who served as Trump’s senior adviser on Russia at the National Security Council during his first term, including when he last met Putin in Helsinki in 2018. president and think he’s “not the big guy that he thinks he is and certainly not the dealmaking genius.” “All the way along, Trump was convinced he has incredible forces of persuasion,” she said, but he came out of the meeting without a ceasefire — the “one thing” he had been pushing for, even after he gave the Russian leader the “red carpet treatment." Trump has “run up against a rock in the form of Putin, who doesn’t want anything from him apart from Ukraine," she said. At home, Democrats expressed alarm at what at times seemed like a day of deference, with Trump clapping for Putin as he walked down a red carpet during an elaborate ceremony welcoming him to U.S. Trump seemed to revel in particular in Putin echoing his oft-repeated assertion that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been in office instead of Democrat Joe Biden at the time. Before news cameras, Trump did not use the opportunity to castigate Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II or human rights abuses he's been accused of committing. “The President rolled out a red carpet and warmly greeted a murderous dictator on American soil and reports indicate he got nothing concrete in return.” “Enough is enough," she went on. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he supports diplomacy but “peacemaking must be done responsibly.” “Instead of caving to Putin, the U.S. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, wrote on social media after the summit that “while the press conference offered few details about their meeting" she was "cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made." Murkowski said it “was also encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings" but that Ukraine “must be part of any negotiated settlement and must freely agree to its terms.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, offered that he was “very proud” of Trump for having had the face-to-face meeting and was “cautiously optimistic” that the war might end “well before Christmas” if a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin transpires. For some Trump allies, the very act of him meeting with Putin was success enough: conservative activist and podcaster Charlie Kirk called it “a great thing.” But in Europe, the summit was seen as a major diplomatic coup for Putin, who has been eager to emerge from geopolitical isolation. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, praised the summit as a breakthrough in restoring high-level dialogue between Moscow and Washington, describing the talks as “calm, without ultimatums and threats.” Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said the summit was “a distinct win for Putin.

Article: It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans This image provided by EcoFlight shows an aerial view of a road winding through the pine-covered Black Hills on Tuesday, May 23, 2023. Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region. “These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,” said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. “Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.” The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks. One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That’s why gold as an asset in investment.” President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews. Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. “So we’re a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.” To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. “There’s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,” said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. It’s the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.” Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold’s mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Coeur’s environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was "thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.” The company is always improving its processes, she added.

Article: President Donald Trump a united front against Russia WASHINGTON -- Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings with him an extraordinary cadre of European leaders to show U.S. The European political heavy-hitters were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they are looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. By arriving as a group, they hope to avoid any debacles like Zelenskyy’s February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. The meeting also is a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. Monday’s showing is a sign both of the progress and the possible distress coming out of the Alaska meeting as many of Europe’s leaders are descending on Washington with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine’s interests, a rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He went on to say that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. and European countries Ukraine will be able to force Russia to “true peace.” Planning to join Zelenskyy in America's capital are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The president also bemoaned media coverage of his summit with Putin and said on Truth Social: "I had a great meeting in Alaska." Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that “the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. "How that’s constructed, what we call it, how it’s built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that’s what we’ll be talking about over the next few days with our partners who are coming in from overseas,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Rubio said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that such a commitment “would be a very big move" by Trump. Ahead of Monday's meeting, France's Macron stressed the importance of building up Ukraine's military and the need to show Putin that Europe interprets his moves as a threat to other nations. “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too,” Macron said.

Article: Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues. “What are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?” the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily. The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road’s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and “vote with their feet,” as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it. “People speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.” The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as “City Limits,” which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions. The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that “these historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.” Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes. Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Under its “20 is Plenty” campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets. When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network. “There’s still a very heavy mindset that automobiles are the primary method of travel and they should be given priority and reverence.” But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.” Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — a research arm funded by auto insurers — illustrates the risks. “Maybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. “States have very slowly started to move away from the 85th percentile as being kind of the gold standard for decision-making,” said Michelle May, who manages Ohio's highway safety program. “People are traveling and living differently than they did 40 years ago, and we want to put safety more at the focus.” It's unclear whether any of these changes will ultimately impact the posted speed on Mitchaw Road.

Takeaways from the Trump-Putin meeting: No agreement, no questions but lots of pomp President Donald Trump, right, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin depart at the conclusion of a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference — but they took no questions. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin. Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II. Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine — or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one. Trump said he and Putin had made some significant progress toward the goal of ending the conflict but gave no details on what that entailed and had to acknowledge that they had been unable to bridge substantial gaps. Putin praised Trump for the “friendly” tone of the talks — Trump said nothing publicly about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Moscow's attacks — and for “understanding that Russia has its own national interests.” Putin said Moscow and Washington should “turn the page,” with relations having sunk to the lowest point since the Cold War. In a social media post, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told followers that the Western press would be on the verge of “losing their minds.” “For three years, they talked about Russia’s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet being rolled out to greet the Russian president in the United States,” she said. The news conference ended up being less than 15 minutes of rather standard diplomatic comments — and gave no indication that any concrete results were achieved — and offered little departure from their previous comments on the war in Ukraine. Trump had gone into the summit saying here was a 25% chance that the summit would fail and that it was meant to be a “feel-out meeting,” but he had also floated the idea of bringing Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting if things went well.

Article: we’re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.” The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service. Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded — 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 — although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it’s too hot “takes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.” Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. “Depending on their situation,” Wines said, that's “probably too late.” Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). “That's why people disregard it.” Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people’s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said. “Whatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we’re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,” Marlon said.

The Department of Corrections' critical incident review of Grant Hardin's May 25 escape from the Calico Rock prison provides the most detailed description so far of his planning and the issues that allowed him to walk out of the facility. Hardin, who worked in the prison's kitchen, said he spent six months planning his escape and used black Sharpie markers and laundry he found lying around the kitchen to create the fake uniform, according to the report. They include a kitchen employee who allowed Hardin on a back dock unsupervised and a tower guard who unlocked the back gate that Hardin walked through without confirming his identity. He was the subject of the TV documentary “Devil in the Ozarks.” The report is one of two reviews into Hardin's escape, which is also being investigated by the Arkansas State Police. The Department of Corrections' review says officials had taken several steps since Hardin's escape, including removing the electric locks from the gates to prevent someone from walking out without an officer present. The report also calls for additional cameras after finding a blind spot on the dock Hardin used, and for any “shakedown” searches for contraband to include mechanical rooms and side rooms.

Article: district judge has denied a request by a Native American tribe and environmentalists to stop the federal government from transferring land in Arizona for a massive copper mining project A U.S. district judge on Friday denied the latest request by a Native American tribe, environmentalists and other plaintiffs to stop the federal government from transferring land in Arizona for a massive copper mining project. “Here, Congress chose to pursue the land exchange despite the existence of many significant trade-offs and the president chose to ratify Congress’s choice by signing the law into effect,” he wrote. "As a result, the Court must accept that this choice advances the public interest and operate from that premise.” Conservation groups that are appealing the decision acknowledged that the clock was ticking but said they were not giving up. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, the group Apache Stronghold and other plaintiffs having been fighting in court for years to save what tribal members call Chi’chil Bildagoteel, which is dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. Before the land exchange can happen, they argued that the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that considers “every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure.” The plaintiffs also raised concerns that an appraisal failed to account for the value of the copper deposits underlying one of the federal parcels to be exchanged The fight over Oak Flat dates back about 20 years, when legislation proposing the land exchange was first introduced. Resolution Copper — a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP — estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona’s economy and create thousands of jobs.

Article: -- California is the first Democratic-led state to wade into a brewing national redistricting fight after President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to draw new maps to maintain the party's slim U.S. The Texas plan was temporarily stalled when minority Democrats left the state to stop the Legislature from passing any bills, but some lawmakers said they'll return to Texas now that California is moving forward with its counter act. State Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers — enough to act without any Republican votes — and Newsom has said he’s not worried about winning the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers to advance the maps. On Friday, a coalition of county officials urged the Legislature to provide money in advance, because many counties are cash-strapped, and officials worry they won't have enough money to administer the election. Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., who spent tens of millions to support the California ballot initiative that gives redistricting power to an independent commission, also plans to “vigorously defend” nonpartisan redistricting, his spokesperson said.

Article: South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea South Korean protesters stage a rally to oppose the joint military exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield or UFS, between the U.S. and South Korea." (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to “any provocation” against its territory. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training. The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies’ exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program. In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies’ stance of “military confrontation” with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract “any provocation going beyond the boundary line.” Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea’s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee’s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “What's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,” Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. When asked whether the Lee government’s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies’ drills, the South’s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas’ disputed western maritime border. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia’s presidential vote is headed to an unprecedented runoff after Sunday's election ended over two decades of ruling party dominance in the Andean nation. Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition’s push for austerity to rescue Bolivia from a looming economic collapse, will face off against former President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, who finished second. “This economic model must change,” Paz declared to crowds who cheered and chanted, “Renewal!” Paz’s campaign had gained unexpected traction as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing whose supporters see him as someone willing to stand up to corruption in the security forces. “Bolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.” The results delivered a blow to Bolivia’s Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leaders who swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country’s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades, even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite. Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president. Whisked away by guards, Rodríguez later called it a “difficult moment.” The win for Paz came as a shock to a nation that had been conditioned by weeks of opinion polls to expect that the leading contenders, Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina, would capture the top two spots. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. The 57-year-old lawmaker is the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who began his political career as a co-founder of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a party persecuted under the bloody military dictatorship of Hugo Banzer in the 1970s.

Article: Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area Cloudbursts are causing chaos in parts of India and Pakistan. (AP Photo/Muhammad Sajjad) ISLAMABAD -- Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area. Here’s what to know about cloudbursts: A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles). The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours. Asfandyar Khan Khattak, a Pakistani official from the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said there was “no forecasting system anywhere in the world” that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst. The Pakistani government said that while an early warning system was in place in Buner district, where hundreds of people died after a cloudburst, the downpour was so sudden and intense that it struck before residents could be alerted. “Rising global temperatures have supercharged the hydrologic cycle, leading to more intense and erratic rainfall,” said Khalid Khan, a former special secretary for climate change in Pakistan and chairman of climate initiative PlanetPulse. In short, climate change is making rare events more frequent, and frequent events more destructive." ___ Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed and Riaz Khan contributed to this report from Islamabad and Peshawar, Pakistan, respectively.

Article: President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House to discuss how to end Russia’s three-year war in Ukraine The stakes are high as Zelenskyy and European leaders head to Washington In this photo taken from video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss how to end Russia's three-year war in Ukraine. After that summit, Trump abandoned the requirement of reaching a ceasefire in order to hold further talks and aligned with Putin's position that negotiations should focus on a long-term settlement instead. They are looking to safeguard Ukraine and Europe more broadly from any further aggression from Moscow — but also are providing a show of support for Zelenskyy after his last visit to the White House led to an angry confrontation. A lot of issues need to be resolved, however, and the two sides have previously established red lines that are incompatible, including questions of whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine's army and whether the country will have any guarantee against further Russian aggression. As a condition for peace, the Russian leader wants Kyiv to give up the Donbas, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the most intense fighting but that Russian forces have failed to capture completely. As part of a deal, Putin has said the United States and its European allies can provide Ukraine with a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense pledge, according to a senior U.S. Zelenskyy has rejected Putin’s demand that Ukraine surrender the Donbas region, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, since the Ukrainian Constitution forbids giving up territory or trading land. French President Emmanuel Macron described Ukraine as an “outpost of our collective defense if Russia wanted to advance again.” “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” Macron said Sunday. The European political heavyweights expected in Washington are Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Ukraine has in recent months been losing more territory against Russia’s bigger army, and Moscow’s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of minor infiltrations in the Donetsk region ahead of the Alaska summit.

Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Burns are seen on the face of Artem aka "Lisnyk", a Ukrainian soldier of Da Vinci Wolves Battalion who was injured during fighting with Russian forces at the front line on Pokrovsk direction, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. that can reach far, the danger is there for the wounded themselves and now for the crews working to get them out,” said Daryna Boiko, the anesthesiologist from the “Ulf” medical service of the 108th Da Vinci Wolves Battalion. “That’s why the main difficulty now is transport.” In the early months of Russia’s full-scale invasion, evacuation vehicles could reach almost to the front line, giving the wounded a better chance of survival. Now, the heavy use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which let an operator see the target before striking, has turned areas up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line into kill zones. The growing use of FPVs has also made moving the wounded between points more difficult, said the commander of the 59th Brigade medical unit with call sign Buhor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons. Everything burns from those FPVs — everything, even tanks.” He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade — a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. “And the Russians are coming in like it’s their own backyard.” Valentyn Pidvalnyi, a 25-year-old assault soldier wounded in the back by shrapnel, said that one month on the positions in 2022 was easier than trying to survive one day now as infantry. “It’s a very hard sector,” he said, “but if you don’t destroy them, they’ll take the tree line, then the town, then the whole region.” Buhor has worked in the Pokrovsk area since late 2022.

(AP Photo) Senait Tadesse, who her 27-year-old daughter made it to Yemen, only to be held captive by kidnappers, poses for a photo at her home in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Sunday, Aug. (AP Photo) ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- When 19-year-old Nigus Yosef told his parents he was going to leave home in Ethiopia’s Tigray region and try to get to Saudi Arabia, they begged him not to go. “They can’t even voice their sorrow.” Nigus Yosef is one of 132 missing from the boat that capsized this month; one of countless people from African countries gone missing on a journey in search of a new life. Senait Tadesse says that her 27-year-old daughter made it to Yemen, only to be held captive by kidnappers who communicated with Tadesse through Facebook, demanding a US$ 6,000 ransom to release her only child. Tadesse said in an interview with The Associated Press in the capital, Addis Ababa, that she sold her car and all her jewelry to raise the cash and deposited the money in an Ethiopian bank account. “Many young people no longer see a future for themselves within a nation that does not prioritize their needs,” explained Yared Hailemariam, an Ethiopian human rights advocate based in Addis Ababa. Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.” The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. After the boat capsized, a relative of one of the survivors managed to send a voice message to them from Saudi Arabia via the messaging app Imo, confirming that Eden’s dead body had been recovered. “The pain is truly overwhelming.” In response to the recent tragedy, the Ethiopian government issued a statement warning citizens “not to take the illegal route,” and to “avoid the services of traffickers at all cost,” while urging people to ”pursue legal avenues for securing opportunities.” But Girmachew Adugna, a migration scholar specializing in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, points out that legal migration channels are slow and time-consuming. “Young people often have little or no access to legal migration pathways, which leads them to migrate through irregular means.” More than 1.1 million Ethiopians were classified as migrants who left their home country and were living abroad in 2024, up from about 200,000 recorded in 2010, according to United Nations figures.

Article: Bolivians have headed to the polls for a pivotal election that could end the long reign of the leftist Movement Toward Socialism party Bolivia heads to the polls as its right-wing opposition eyes first victory in decades FILE - Bolivian presidential candidate Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga attends his campaign rally ahead of the upcoming presidential election, in La Paz, Bolivia, Aug. (AP Photo/Juan Karita, File) LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivians headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in presidential and congressional elections that could spell the end of the Andean nation's long-dominant leftist party and see a right-wing government elected for the first time in over two decades. With the nation’s worst economic crisis in four decades leaving Bolivians waiting for hours in fuel lines, struggling to find subsidized bread and squeezed by double-digit inflation, the opposition candidates are billing the race as a chance to alter the country’s destiny. “I have rarely, if ever, seen a situational tinderbox with as many sparks ready to ignite,” Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, founding partner of Aurora Macro Strategies, a New York-based advisory firm, writes in a memo. Breaking the MAS party's monopoly on political power, he adds, pushes “the country into uncharted political waters amid rising polarization, severe economic fragility and a widening rural–urban divide.” The outcome will determine whether Bolivia — a nation of about 12 million people with the largest lithium reserves on Earth and crucial deposits of rare earth minerals — follows a growing trend in Latin America, where right-wing leaders like Argentina’s libertarian Javier Milei, Ecuador’s strongman Daniel Noboa and El Salvador’s conservative populist Nayib Bukele have surged in popularity. Doria Medina and Quiroga have praised the Trump administration and vowed to restore ties with the United States — ruptured in 2008 when charismatic, long-serving former President Evo Morales expelled the American ambassador. After storming to office in 2006 at the start of the commodities boom, Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, nationalized the nation's oil and gas industry, using the lush profits to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure and improve the lives of the rural poor. After three consecutive presidential terms, as well as a contentious bid for an unprecedented fourth in 2019 that set off popular unrest and led to his ouster, Morales has been barred from this race by Bolivia's constitutional court. Rather than back the candidate widely considered his heir, Morales, holed up in his tropical stronghold and evading an arrest warrant on charges related to his relationship with a 15-year-old girl, has urged his supporters to deface their ballots or leave them blank. Doria Medina and Quiroga, familiar faces in Bolivian politics who both served in past neoliberal governments and have run for president three times before, have struggled to stir up interest as voter angst runs high. “There's enthusiasm for change but no enthusiasm for the candidates,” said Eddy Abasto, 44, a Tupperware vendor in Bolivia's capital of La Paz torn between voting for Doria Medina and Quiroga. “It's always the same, those in power live happily spending the country’s money, and we suffer.” Doria Medina and Quiroga have warned of the need for a painful fiscal adjustment, including the elimination of Bolivia’s generous food and fuel subsidies, to save the nation from insolvency. “Both candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.” All 130 seats in Bolivia’s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house. If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct.

In perhaps the most visible sign of how fed up Bolivians are with the party, leftist politicians casting their ballots across Bolivia on Sunday faced barrages of boos, insults and thrown objects. Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his tropical stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president.

He's the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who began his political career as a co-founder of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a radical party persecuted under the bloody military dictatorship of Hugo Banzer in the 1970s, before striking a pact with Banzer’s right-wing party in order to become president from 1989 to 1993.

In one of the deadliest incidents, 24 people from one family died in the village of Qadar Nagar when floodwaters swept through their home on the eve of a wedding. According to a government statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is monitoring the relief operations and has ordered faster distribution of aid, evacuation of stranded people, and intensified searches for the missing. The country also suffers regular flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September, particularly in the rugged northwest, where villages are often perched on steep slopes and riverbanks. In Kishtwar district, teams are continuing their efforts in the remote village of Chositi, looking for dozens of missing people after the area was hit by flash floods three days earlier.

(AP Photo/Khalid Mohammed, File) IRBIL, Iraq -- Iraqi officials have begun the excavation of what is believed to be a mass grave left behind by the Islamic State extremist group during its rampage across the country a decade ago. Local authorities are working with the judiciary, forensic investigations, Iraq’s Martyrs’ Foundation, and the directorate of mass graves to carry out the excavation of the site of a sink hole in al-Khafsa, south of the northern city of Mosul, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday. The war against IS officially ended in March 2019, when U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, which was the last sliver of land the extremists controlled. Rabah Nouri Attiyah, a lawyer who has worked on more than 70 cases of missing people in Nineveh, told the AP that information he obtained from the foundation and different Iraqi courts during his investigations points to Khasfa as “the largest mass grave in modern Iraqi history." Al-Asady, however, said investigators “cannot confirm yet if it is the largest mass grave” to be found in Iraq, “but according to the size of the space, we estimate it to be one of the largest.” Attiyah said roughly 70% of the human remains at Khasfa are believed to belong to Iraqi army and police personnel, with other victims including Yazidis. Testimonies and witness statements, as well as findings from other mass graves in Nineveh, indicate that most of the military, police and other security forces personnel killed by IS are expected to be found at Khasfa, along with Yazidis from Sinjar and Shiite victims from Tal Afar, he said.

Diane was taking part in a “school for husbands,” a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about “positive masculinity” in health and social issues and promote them in their communities. In Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health. Following his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed.” The program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality. The classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women’s access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants. “By educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital and helping with domestic work at home, you’re protecting people’s health,” Malick said.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus,File) MELBOURNE, Austalia -- MELBOURNE, Austalia (AP) — Google has agreed to pay a 55 million Australian dollar ($36 million) fine for signing anticompetitive deals with Australia’s two largest telcos that banned the installation of competing search engines on some smartphones, the U.S. Google has also signed a court-enforceable undertaking that commits the company to removing certain pre-installation and default search engine restrictions from its contracts with Android phone manufacturers and telcos, the commission said. The tech company said in a statement: “We’re pleased to resolve the ACCC’s concerns, which involved provisions that haven’t been in our commercial agreements for some time.” Commissioner chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb said: "Conduct that restricts competition is illegal in Australia because it usually means less choice, higher costs or worse service for consumers.” “Importantly, these changes come at a time when AI search tools are revolutionising how we search for information, creating new competition,” Cass-Gottlieb added. Last year, Telstra, Optus and their smaller rival TPG agreed to court-enforceable undertakings with the commission that they would not renew or make similar deals with Google to limit search options.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy -- Pope Leo XIV spent the last Sunday of his summer vacation with several dozen refugees, homeless and poor people and the church volunteers who help them, celebrating a special Mass for them and inviting them into the Vatican’s lakeside estate for a lunch of lasagna and roast veal. “And I encourage you not to distinguish between those who assist and those who are assisted, between those who seem to give and those who seem to receive, between those who appear poor and those who feel they have something to offer in terms of time, skills, and help,” he said. Former parishioners and church workers say he greatly reinforced the work of the local Caritas charity, opening soup kitchens and shelters for migrants and rallying funds to build oxygen plants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article: The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration Picketers march around the departures level at the Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, British Columbia, Sunday, Aug. (Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- The Canada Industrial Relations Board declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal Monday and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration. The strike at Canada's largest airline entered its third day on Monday and is affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season, and the two sides remain far apart on pay and other issues. “The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” the Canada Industrial Relations Board board, or CIRB, said in a written decision. The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labor laws, said the union needs to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties. CUPE national President Mark Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants. Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

(AP Photo/Esteban Felix) Actor Sebastián Solorza, who has Down syndrome and aims to run for president as an independent candidate, smiles during an interview at his home in Santiago, Chile, Thursday, July 31, 2025. 16, with the campaign so far defined by the mutual attacks between the two main contestants: The far-right José Antonio Kast, who lost to current leftist president Gabriel Boric in 2021, and Jeannette Jara, the ruling coalition’s communist nominee. While it's unlikely he will secure the necessary support to run for president — he has collected a little over 600 of the 35,000 signatures required — he sees his political foray as a success. On the streets of Huechuraba, a quiet and green neighborhood in the northern part of Chile's capital, Solorza is often greeted by supporters, fans, and workers from restaurants and cafés where he is a regular. “Let it be the people who ultimately decide our future.” Solorza's political aspirations open the door to “raise the voices of people with Down syndrome” and help to “demystify myths and prejudices still present in society,” said Carolina Gallardo, director of the Chilean nonprofit Down Up Foundation, which offers support and community for families raising children with Down syndrome. His mother, Jenny Solorza, recalls his early years as “very dark,” because doctors never provided a clear diagnosis for their son, leading them to search for information on their own. As a result, “Sebastián has a very broad musical culture, and that’s what he grew up with.” Solorza attended special schools where he developed his passion for the arts, fueled by music, rather than focusing on traditional academics. He later rose to national fame for his leading role as Tomy in the Chilean thriller “Chromosome 21.” The series, which follows a detective trying to determine if a young man found at a murder scene is a witness or a suspect, ranked second on Netflix in Chile just two days after its release in 2022.

The move in relation to the key White House meeting on Monday is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Trump in the Oval Office in February. The European leaders’ presence at Zelenskyy’s side, demonstrating Europe’s support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Zelenskyy risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Trump says he wants to broker with Russia. Von der Leyen, head of the European Union’s executive branch, posted on X that “at the request of President Zelenskyy, I will join the meeting with President Trump and other European leaders in the White House tomorrow.” In a quick succession Sunday, a stream of European leaders also announced that they'll be going.

Article: The Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval masterpiece depicting the 1066 Norman conquest of England, is set for a new chapter With the Bayeux Tapestry that tells of their long rivalry, France and Britain are making nice FILE - This photo taken Wednesday, Sept. The Bayeux Tapestry, with its scenes of sword-wielding knights in ferocious combat and King Harold of England's famous death, pierced by an arrow to an eye, has since the 11th century served as a sobering parable of military might, vengeance, betrayal and the complexity of Anglo-French relations, long seeped with blood and rivalry but also affection and cooperation. Now, the medieval forerunner of today's comic strips, commissioned as propaganda for the Normandy duke William known as “the Conqueror” after he took the English throne from Harold, is being readied for a new narrative mission. Next year, the fragile artistic and historic treasure will be gingerly transported from its museum in Bayeux, Normandy, to star in a blockbuster exhibition in London's British Museum, from September 2026 to July 2027. outing in almost 1,000 years will testify to the warming latest chapter in ties across the English Channel that chilled with the U.K.'s acrimonous departure from the European Union in 2020. Bayeux Museum curator Antoine Verney says the cross-Channel trip will be a home-coming of sorts for the tapestry, because historians widely believe that it was embroidered in England, using woolen threads on linen canvas, and because William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was such a major juncture in English history, seared into the U.K.'s collective consciousness. Moving an artwork so unwieldy — made from nine pieces of linen fabric stitched together and showing 626 characters, 37 buildings, 41 ships and 202 horses and mules in a total of 58 scenes — is further complicated by its great age and the wear-and-tear of time. Believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror’s half-brother, to decorate a new cathedral in Bayeux in 1077, the treasure is thought to have remained there, mostly stored in a wooden chest and almost unknown, for seven centuries, surviving the French Revolution, fires and other perils. Since then, only twice is the embroidery known to have been exhibited outside of the Normandy city: Napoleon Bonaparte had it shown off in Paris' Louvre Museum from late 1803 to early 1804. During World War II, it was displayed again in the Louvre in late 1944, after Allied forces that had landed in Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, of that year had fought onward to Paris and liberated it. But at the same time, this is a work that has already traveled extensively and been handled a great deal.” During the treasure's stay in the U.K., its museum in Bayeux will be getting a major facelift costing tens of millions of euros (dollars). 1 this year, with reopening planned for October 2027, when the embroidery will be re-housed in a new building, encased on an inclined 70-meter long table that Verney said will totally transform the viewing experience. “The studies required to allow its transfer to London and its exhibition at the British Museum are not finished, are under discussion, and are being carried out between the two governments,” Verney said. “How can one imagine, in my view, that the British Museum would risk damaging, through the exhibition, this work that is a major element of a shared heritage?” he asked.

Article: A federal judge is considering whether detainees have been denied their legal rights at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades MIAMI -- A federal judge will hear arguments Monday over whether detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades have been denied their legal rights. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don’t have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. “The situation at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ is so anomalous from what is typically granted at other immigration facilities,” Eunice Cho, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said Thursday during a virtual meeting to prepare for Monday's hearing in Miami. But before delving into the core issues of the detainees’ rights, Ruiz has said he wants to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district. “I think we should all be prepared that, before we get into any real argument about preliminary injunctive relief, that we at least spend some time working through the venue issues,” Ruiz said Thursday. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: North Carolina farmer Jamie Ager is part of a new crop of Democratic candidates the party is turning to as it tries to compete in the tough, often rural districts it may need to flip to retake the U.S. -- Jamie Ager has spent much of the past year rebuilding his 250-acre farm in the foothills of western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene tore through the region, cutting power, destroying fences and scattering livestock. Now, the fifth-generation farmer is running for Congress — part of a new crop of Democratic candidates the party is turning to as it tries to compete in the tough, often rural districts it may need to flip to retake the U.S. And in parts of North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, the party is betting that kind of local credibility can cut through skepticism in places where the Democratic brand has fallen. Ager says he sees national Democrats as out of touch with rural life: too “academic” and “politically correct and scripted.” “That’s just not what people are interested in,” he says. But the execution of a lot of those ideas has been gummed up, you know, not well executed.” Heading into next year’s midterms, Democrats believe momentum is on their side. With power, water and telecommunications down due to last year's hurricane, Ager's Hickory Nut Gap farm became a hub for the community — hosting cookouts and using propane to grill food for neighbors. “We have to look in the mirror and say, ‘Let’s try something new.’” In a district where nearly 62% of residents live in very low-density areas, Barnette believes Ager’s identity — as a business owner, coach and father with deep local roots — could cut through. In the video launching his campaign, Ager shows flooding on the farm and is seen on the porch of his home, feeding chickens, driving a tractor and spending time with his wife and three sons. He’s buttoned-up and soft-spoken, with a long resume in elected office and deep roots in Kalamazoo, having served for a decade on the city commission before winning a seat in the state House in 2010. In a district anchored by conservative and religious values, Democrats see McCann as the kind of steady, experienced figure who can make inroads — especially as backlash builds to Trump’s tax bill, which includes deep spending cuts.

Article: As the Republican president pushes states to redraw their congressional districts to the GOP’s advantage, Democrats have shown they are willing to go beyond words of outrage and use whatever power they do have to win. Democrats in the Texas Legislature started it off by delaying, for now, Republican efforts to expand the GOP majority in the state's delegation and help preserve party control of the U.S. "For everyone who’s been asking, ‘Where is the fight?’ – well, here it is.” There is no guarantee Democrats can prevent the Republican-powered redistricting, just as Democrats on Capitol Hill have not been able to stop Trump’s moves. So far, progressive and establishment Democrats are aligned, uniting what has often been a fragmented opposition since Republicans led by Trump took control of the federal government with their election sweep in November. They can challenge his redistricting ploy with tangible moves as they also push back against the Republicans' tax and spending law and press the case that he is shredding American democracy. “We’ve been imploring Democrats where they have power on the state and local level to flex that power,” said Maurice Mitchell, who leads the Working Families Party at the left flank of mainstream U.S. “There’s been this overwrought talk about fighters and largely performative actions to suggest that they’re in the fight.” This time, he said, Democrats are “taking real risks in protecting all of our rights” against “an authoritarian president who only understands the fight.” Texas made sense for Republicans as the place to start a redistricting scuffle. Hochul dismissed Texas Republicans as “lawbreaking cowboys.” Newsom’s press office directed all-caps social media posts at Trump, mimicking his signature sign off: “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.” U.S. Then, with Texas bravado, Romero reached further into history: “We’re asking for help, maybe just as they did back in the days of the Alamo.” A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 15% of Democrats’ own voters described the party using words like “weak” or “apathetic.” An additional 10% called it “ineffective” or “disorganized.” Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who is raising money to support Texas Democrats, has encouraged Democratic-run statehouses to redraw districts now rather than wait for GOP states to act. The left “had its hair on fire” cheering those moments, O’Neill recalled, but were “left even more frustrated in the aftermath.” Trump still secured tax cuts for the wealthy, accelerated deportations and cut safety net programs, just as some of his controversial nominees were confirmed over vocal Democratic opposition. “Now,” O’Neill said, “there is some marriage of the rhetoric we’ve been seeing since Trump’s inauguration with some actual action.” O’Neill looked back wistfully to the decision by Senate Democrats not to eliminate the filibuster “when our side had the trifecta,” so a simple majority could pass major legislation.

Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as “personal and intimate.” The first female mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment: The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working. Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.” Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail “due to COVID,” saying her travel accommodations were “a matter of safety, not of luxury.” The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha’s Vineyard. The pair used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” he said. She is also among more than 100 people brought up on corruption charges in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans two decades ago, said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a watchdog group that provided photographs and information to federal authorities in the latest case.

Article: Soho House plans to go private again after four years on Wall Street Soho House agrees to go private again in a deal led by hotel giant MCR FILE - Ashton Kutcher walks on the field before an NFL football game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears, Dec. Among other big names to join Soho House's future leadership is actor and now tech investor Ashton Kutcher, who is set to join the company's board following the deal's completion. In a statement, Morse said that MCR had “long admired” Soho House and that its investment in the company “represents a strategic opportunity to combine our operational expertise with one of the most distinctive brands in hospitality.” Soho House CEO Andrew Carnie pointed to the club's growth over the years, and said that returning to private ownership will help the company “build on this momentum." Soho House's roots date back to 1995, starting with a single club in London opened by founder Nick Jones. Soho House describes itself as a “global membership platform of physical and digital spaces.” It bills its flagship clubs — which include spas, gyms and other luxury amenities — as a “home for creative people to come together and belong.” Known for attracting celebrities and other figures with deep pockets, membership fees often rack up to at least several thousand dollars a year. In earnings announced earlier this month, Soho House said had a total of it raked in $329.8 million in total revenues for its second fiscal quarter, an 8.9% jump year-over-year.

Article: Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding Republicans look to make a U-turn on federal commitment to electric vehicles for the Postal Service One of the U.S. “I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted," he said. A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.” Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force." She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract," Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense. “For now,” she added, "gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.” Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project "has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.” The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest" and not unexpected. “The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said. They do the best they can.” The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.” The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were "carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money. “It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle," he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.” ____ Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.

Article: Air Canada says it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration People wait outside of Air Canada check in at the Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, B.C., Canada, on Saturday, Aug. (Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) — Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada’s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

Article: A judge has fined Qantas Airways $59 million for illegally firing over 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic MELBOURNE -- A judge on Monday fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for illegally firing more than 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Australian Federal Court Justice Michael Lee said the outsourcing of 1,820 baggage handler and cleaner jobs at Australian airports in late 2020 was the “largest and most significant contravention” of relevant Australian labor laws in their 120-year history. Qantas agreed in December last year to pay AU$120 million ($78 million) in compensation to former staff after seven High Court judges unanimously rejected the Sydney-based airline’s appeal against the judgment that outsourcing their jobs was illegal. Lee ruled that the minimum fine to create a deterrence should be AU$90 million ($59 million), noting that Qantas executives had expected to save AU$125 million ($81 million) a year through outsourcing the jobs. “If any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,” Lee said. "I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,” Lee added. Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson, who was the airline's chief financial officer during the layoffs, said in a statement after Monday's decision: “We sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result.” “The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families," she said. Michael Kaine, national secretary of the union that represents 60,000 members, said he felt vindicated by Monday’s ruling, which ends a five-year legal battle that Qantas had been widely expected to win. “It is a significant — the most significant — industrial outcome in Australia’s history and it sends a really clear message to Qantas and to every employer in Australia: Treat your work force illegally and you will be held accountable,” Kaine told reporters. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a consumer watchdog, sued the airline in the Federal Court alleging that Qantas engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights from May 2021 through to July 2022 that had already been canceled.

AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) NEW YORK -- Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter's stores. “For 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty — bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury — and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,” said Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer of Ulta Beauty, in a statement. Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Target, said in a statement he was committed to "offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target.” The partnership was announced in 2020 and came as the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping habits and more people tried to minimize potential exposure to the virus through one-stop shopping. “It’s a combination of two winning retailers that have great momentum in the market that can redefine the category,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told The Associated Press back in 2020. The announcement comes as Target is struggling to regain its footing with its shoppers who are pulling back on discretionary items and are shopping at other rivals that they believe to be lower price or offer better merchandise.

Article: Canada’s government has forced Air Canada and the union representing flight attendants into arbitration after a work stoppage stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season Air Canada planes sit on the runway at Pearson International Airport as flight attendants go on strike in Toronto on Saturday, Aug. (Sammy Kogan/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- Canada’s government forced Air Canada and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration Saturday after a work stoppage stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike — and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada’s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. “It is all because of the incredible dependency of Canadians.” Last year, the government forced the country’s two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. “With valuable cargo grounded and passengers stranded, the government made the right decision to refer the two sides to binding arbitration," said Matthew Holmes, the executive vice president for the Chamber of Commerce — adding that “close to a million Canadians and international visitors could be impacted" if it takes Air Canada a week to be fully operational again. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak." Many travelers expressed frustration over Air Canada's response to the strike. “What’s stressful is to not hear anything from Air Canada,” said Reyt, who is trying to return to Montreal, where he is an associate professor of organizational behavior at McGill University. He said he only received one email from the airline on Thursday warning of potential strike disruptions, but had no further information as of Saturday evening in Cannes, where he was visiting family. She has been trying to help her brother and cousin get home to Edmonton, Alberta since the second leg of their Air Canada trip was canceled during what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover in Montreal on Friday night. “We hope that Air Canada lifts the lockout and negotiates fairly.” Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada’s flight attendants. “I think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,” he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't "a way just to silence them.” Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans but we cannot work for free," Natasha Stea, an Air Canada flight attendant and local union president, said before the government intervention was announced. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space. “Imagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.” More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness — or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.

While that technology is still decades away, control over the moon in the intervening years could determine which countries emerge as superpowers, according to Joseph Rooke, a London-based cybersecurity expert who has worked in the U.K. The end of the Cold War temporarily halted a lot of investments in space, but competition is likely to increase as the promise of mining the moon becomes a reality. “If you dominate Earth’s energy needs, that’s game over.” China and Russia have announced plans for their own nuclear plants on the moon in the coming years, while the U.S. to stop spreading irresponsible rhetoric, stop expanding military build-up in space, and make due contribution to upholding the lasting peace and security in space.” Nations are scrambling to create their own rocket and space programs to exploit commercial prospects and ensure they aren't dependent on foreign satellites.

Article: The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people — followed closely by Hurricane Rita. On Louisiana’s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state’s 2029 coastal master plan. The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been “dying for over a century” because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said. In Bayou La Batre, Alabama — a fishing village built in the late 1700s — The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. Such efforts won't prevent all land losses, but in Louisiana, “cumulatively, they could make a big difference," said Denise Reed, a research scientist who is working on Louisiana's coastal master plan. “It could buy us some time.” On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time. Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt. That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California's most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley. Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities. But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. The Corps rebuilt beaches, dunes and human-made structures from Massachusetts to Virginia and now is turning to areas farther inland that are increasingly vulnerable to more powerful storm surges, Cresitello said.

Article: New research finds early human ancestors during the Stone Age were more picky about the rocks they used for making tools than previously thought Stone Age humans were picky about which rocks they used for making tools, study finds This photo provided by the Homa Peninsula Paleoanthropology Project shows the Nyayanga excavation site in Kenya, in July 2025. Plummer/Homa Peninsula Paleoanthropology Project via AP) WASHINGTON -- Early human ancestors during the Old Stone Age were more picky about the rocks they used for making tools than previously known, according to research published Friday. By around 2.6 million years ago, early humans had developed a method of pounding rocks together to chip off sharp flakes that could be used as blades for butchering meat. “But hippo skin is really tough" — and not all rocks were suitable for creating blades sharp enough to pierce hippo skin, said co-author Thomas Plummer, a paleoanthropologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. Co-author Emma Finestone of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History added: “When we think about stone tools, not every rock is equal in terms of the quality of tools.” At the Nyayanga site, researchers found durable blades made of quartzite, a rock material that they traced to streambeds and other locations around 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. This is probably the earliest time we have in the archaeological record an indication of that behavior,” said Eric Delson, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.

Delegates reacts during a plenary session of Second Part of the Fifth Session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5.2), at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, Thursday, Aug. (Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP) Delegates reacts during a plenary session of Second Part of the Fifth Session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5.2), at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, Thursday, Aug. (Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP) Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today. The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. “There are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable," said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution. But “If you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,” Enck said. “Those two things cannot get recycled together." The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an “all-of-the-above approach.” He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents," said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute. Because of this, Kaufman says, “The aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.” “Reuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,” Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.

Article: “This documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.” Directed by Chris Smith, “Devo” uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young. Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones’ “I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which earned them a crucial slot on “Saturday Night Live.” On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from “Ghostbusters.” They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, “Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,” in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980’s “Freedom of Choice,” which featured “Whip It,” a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of “devolution.” “We were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the ’50s and ’60s.” Casale says in the movie. “What we saw was regression.” The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks — portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie “Metropolis.” “We had a meta-approach,” Casale tells the AP. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.” Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The song “Whip It” was written after reading Thomas Pynchon’s 760-page postmodern sci-fi tome “Gravity’s Rainbow.” The video — featuring cowboys drinking beer, dangerous gunplay and assault — was actually mocking President Ronald Reagan and his macho brand of conservatism. Members of Devo — which also included Mark's brother, Bob, Gerald's brother, Bob, and Alan Myers — performed on TV and chatted with talk show hosts like David Letterman but their satire never seemed never to break through. “Nobody wanted to hear us talking about the duality of human nature and the dangers of groupthink and the atrophication of people being able to think logically and think critically,” Casale says. “The only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn’t seem to have done that in the past,” Mothersbaugh tells the AP. “I always tried to be optimistic that devolution was something that was going to be corrected and that our message would be not necessary at this point, but unfortunately it’s more real than ever.” After Devo, Casale directed music videos and commercials, while Mothersbaugh scored movies and TV shows such as “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse,” “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,” “Rugrats” and “Hello Tomorrow!” There are signs of optimism when members of Devo play live these days. But there’s also, there’s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it’s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.” Devo are set to hit the road later this year in a co-headlining tour with the B-52's.

Article: (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, file) LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA. His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's “The Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," the second of his two BAFTA nominations. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable — more human — element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since. Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021’s “Last Night in Soho,” remembered the actor in an Instagram post as “kind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.” “The closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. He got his break with “Billy Budd” and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the “angry young men” movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking. That was perhaps most notable in the 1965 adaptation of John Fowles’ creepy debut novel “The Collector,” where he played the awkward and lonely Freddie Clegg, who kidnapped Samantha Eggar’s Miranda Grey in a warped attempt to win her love. “And he said to me, ‘You should always study your voice.’” Stamp then segued into a spot-on Olivier impersonation, continuing, “‘Because, as you get older, your looks go, but your voice will become empowered.’” His career took a bit of a hiatus from the late 1960s after he missed out on the role of James Bond to replace Sean Connery, that included a years-long stint in India and which saw him embrace a more holistic approach to his self. He played John Tunstall in 1988's “Young Guns,” the Galactic Republic leader in 1999's “Star Wars” prequel “The Phantom Menace,” appeared in the comedies “Yes Man” and “Get Smart” in 2008 and delivered voice performances in the video games “Halo 3” and “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.” Born in London’s East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton.

Article: It beat out “Freakier Friday” for a second time, and the newcomer “Nobody 2.” 'Weapons' maintains top spot in second weekend, scaring off newcomer 'Nobody 2' This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures via AP) LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Weapons” scared its way to the top of the box office in its debut and managed to stay there during its second weekend, beating out “Freakier Friday” and newcomer “Nobody 2.” Zach Cregger's horror film earned $25 million in 3,450 North American theaters, a 43% drop from its first weekend. “August came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,” Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like “Deadpool and Wolverine” and the horror sci-fi “Alien: Romulus” that premiered this time last year. “It’s just that eclectic mix of films with appeal to every demographic.” “Nobody 2” follows the pandemic success of the first in the series, “Nobody," which was released in 2021. Jim Orr, president of domestic distributions at Universal Pictures, said he hopes the movie's reaction scores — an 89% Audience score and B+ CinemaScore — point “to a long and successful run at the domestic box office.” “The Fantastic Four: First Steps" took the fourth spot during its fourth weekend in theaters, bringing in $8.8 million domestically.

(Enrico Nawrath/Bayreuth Festival via AP) BAYREUTH, Germany -- In Wagner's home theater, a twist has been added to the classic opera “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.” Instead of Walther joining the guild of master singers and preparing to marry Eva after he wins the song contest, in Bayeuth's new version she grabs the medal out of the young knight's hands, returns it to her father, then leads her future husband offstage for a future forsaking the traditions of their family and city. Sixtus Beckmesser, the petulant town clerk who loses the song contest to Walther, pulls the plug on the cow, which darkens and sags, during the final oration defending the imperative of German art by the cobbler Hans Sachs. Davids' ending is less jarring than Kasper Holten’s 2017 Covent Garden staging, set in a men's club where Eva is horrified Walther would want to join the misogynistic Meistersingers and runs away in tears. “I really felt like in this production Eva and Walther truly had a fun connection — fun, young, loving connection — and I just leaned into that and listened to Spyres' beautiful tenor,” Nilsson said. Davids' contrast was sharp from Barrie Kosky's 2017 production, set partly in Wagner's home of Wahnfried and the Nuremberg trials courtroom, with Walther and Sachs portrayed as Wagner of various ages. Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look. She was amused.” Edwards, the set designer, had orange and yellow spears of light that resemble fairgrounds and included architectural details from the Bayreuth auditorium such as circular lamps in sets of three in the church and seats like the ones the audience was viewing from.

Article: Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film “East of Wall.” The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. At the heart of “East of Wall,” now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz’s narration in “Days of Heaven.” “East of Wall” is best when it’s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy’s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama’s sake. A native of Los Angeles who’d worked as an actress and production designer, Beecroft felt stalled and hopped in a truck with her friend and cinematographer Austin Shelton to find the stories of everyday Americans.

Article: Texas Democrats have ended a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan no-holds-barred fight over President Donald Trump’s desire to reshape United States House district maps to his advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation – reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu in a statement on Monday. The return of Texas Democrats to the Republican-run Congress in the Lone Star State comes as California Democrats advance a countereffort to redraw their congressional boundaries in retaliation – a tit-for-tat that puts the nation’s two most populous states at the centre of an expanding battle over control of the US Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny their Republican-majority colleagues the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Capitol Hill. The US president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Texas Governor Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people earlier this summer.

In a complaint filed in August 2021, Dominion accused Newsmax of having “manufactured, endorsed, repeated and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies about Dominion” during and after the 2020 election. This year, a Delaware judge ruled that Newsmax had defamed Dominion but said a jury must decide whether the conservative news brand had done so with “actual malice,” which must be proved for a public figure to succeed in a defamation case.

Article: -- Louisiana sued the online gaming platform Roblox on Thursday, alleging the wildly popular site has perpetuated an environment where sexual predators "thrive, unite, hunt and victimize kids." The lawsuit, filed in state court by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox has failed to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from adult predators. "Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety." The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services. Last month, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. "While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards - such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing - to help protect our community," the company added. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users." The free online gaming platform has more than 111 million monthly users. Its website describes Roblox as "the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine." Roblox doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information, such as phone numbers. Roblox, which according to its website has "a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors," doesn't allow children under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission. The company says on its website that age verification "is a new feature that is currently in testing on Roblox." Last month, it launched a feature that requires teenagers aged 13 to 17 to send a video selfie to verify their ages if they want to chat freely with people they know, called "trusted connections." Amid mounting criticism in recent months, the company has implemented additional measures that it says will keep their young users safe. Roblox said the system led it to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine’s future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. WATCH: What to expect from Zelenskyy’s next meeting with Trump, backed by European leaders By coming as a group, they hope to avoid debacles like Zelenskyy’s February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for U.S. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. Zelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe. European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in Washington are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.” The European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official. WATCH: Security expert analyzes fallout of Trump’s alignment with Putin after their summit The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. Ahead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump.” He separately lashed out at the Wall Street Journal and other outlets “who truly don’t have a clue, tell me everything that I am doing wrong on the Russia/Ukraine MESS.” Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. ‘A very big move’ European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) WASHINGTON -- Three states moved to deploy hundreds of members of their National Guard to the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. The moves announced Saturday came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of D.C.,” and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation.” Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. “I can’t believe that this is happening in this country at this time.” Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreach and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. “Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities,” Finnigan said. Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for the safety or her students given the “unmarked officers of all types” now roaming Washington and detaining people. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen and Ohio Gov Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the U.S. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard “stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region” and that the troops' “unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.” Federal agents have appeared in some of the city’s most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an “emergency police commissioner” after the district’s top lawyer sued to contest. In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government’s failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.” In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” She added that if Washington residents stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don’t have full access to it.” ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.

The man who died on the 210 Freeway was identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Jutiapa, Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which said the Guatemalan consulate had confirmed the identity.

Article: Ruben Amorim was 55 seconds into a post-match news conference that lasted less than three-and-a-half minutes at Old Trafford on Sunday when he was asked a question that made him flinch back and raise his eyebrows in disbelief. It concerned his goalkeeper and whether he had given any consideration to picking veteran former England man Tom Heaton ahead of Altay Bayindir for the Premier League defeat by Arsenal. Events can change situations quickly when a transfer window is nearing its close and it has been established Andre Onana's former club Inter Milan are looking at bringing in a new goalkeeper. When it became apparent Gianluigi Donnarumma was likely to be available as he is no longer required at Paris St Germain, the word coming out of Old Trafford was the Italian goalkeeper would not be heading their way. After all, it couldn't have been any clearer who his first choice was when the 29-year-old was picked for the Europa League final in May even though he had made high-profile mistakes in the build-up to the defeat by Tottenham in Bilbao. However, while Amorim said in his pre-match news conference on Friday afternoon the Cameroon international was available to face Mikel Arteta's side, by kick-off, he had only three full training sessions behind him after suffering a hamstring injury early in July. In Onana's absence, Amorim thought Bayindir had performed well during a summer campaign across three countries in which United remained unbeaten and the 27-year-old had featured in three-and-a-half of the five games. It was on that basis Amorim concluded in order for players to believe his 'group' philosophy, it would be the wrong decision to axe Bayindir, who in his eyes had done nothing to deserve it, for Onana, whose fitness had to be taken on trust.

Article: Two days after Donald Trump’s failed summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on Fox News and raised a familiar point about the Trump administration’s position. Rubio added, “Ukraine is going to have to accept things it doesn’t like, and Russia is going to have to accept things that it doesn’t like.” On CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” the secretary made a similar point, though host Margaret Brennan pressed him on a key detail that too often goes unsaid. Brennan asked about the potential for a “dangerous precedent” that the United States “now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force.” Rubio responded that Putin “has already seized land by force,” which was true, but which was also beside the point. “Are you demanding withdrawal?” the host asked, leading Rubio to respond: “In order to have a deal here to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. Olga Rudenko, the editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent in Ukraine, has a new opinion piece in The New York Times with a straightforward headline: “All Russia Needs to Do Is Go Home.” From the column: The meeting between Mr. For all of the complexities surrounding possible territorial “swaps,” security guarantees and diplomatic partnerships, there’s a far more straightforward solution just sitting there, waiting for attention: Putin could withdraw his forces from Ukraine. Trump has spent months insisting that Putin wants “peace,” and the Republican reiterated the point to Fox News’ Sean Hannity after his failed summit in Alaska, saying that he genuinely believes that the Russian dictator wants to “solve the problem.” But this doesn’t have to be complicated: All Putin has to do is decide to stop fighting the war he started. Ukraine proved to be far more formidable than Russia expected; Russia has paid a heavy price for its miscalculation; and Russia could decide — literally at any time — to simply end the unprovoked conflict.

Article: Former national security adviser explains toggle caption Mstyslav Cherno/AP/AP President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Going into his Alaska summit last week, Trump said the main goal was to negotiate a ceasefire deal, and he warned of "severe consequences" for Russia if that deal wasn't reached. The united front is posed to prevent a repeat of Zelenskyy's last visit to the White House, but it's also an opportunity to ensure Ukraine has a say in the negotiations. But the real question is, is President Trump actually looking for a true peace agreement or is he effectively taking President Putin's side and saying it's Ukraine that has to make a whole series of concessions? It's interesting to me that there is more nervousness around Zelenskyy coming than there was around Putin coming when Zelenskyy is supposed to be a friend, and we know that Putin is a foe. Fadel: What about this concession they say they did get, that they could offer security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again, something they say Putin has agreed to and they called it 'game changing?' Sullivan: Well, security guarantees are absolutely essential because over the long term, what Putin really wants is the subjugation of Ukraine. Sullivan: Well, President Biden took the position, which President Trump has also taken, that the United States will not directly enter the war against Russia with American forces on the ground. If President Trump, alongside Europe, really cranked up the economic pressure on Russia at a moment when their economy is weak, I do believe it would create more leverage to get a good deal, a true peace in Ukraine. And if you look at the Russian economic official speaking publicly about how their war machine is sputtering, now is the moment, in my view, to really tighten the pressure, especially with oil prices being where they are globally.

Article: The conservative cable news channel Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company Dominion over baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, according to a new regulatory filing. The timing was striking: Right around the time that Trump announced a renewed crusade against voting machines, based in part on his conspiratorial assumptions about the election equipment, the public learned of Newsmax’s settlement with one of the nation’s leading voting machine companies. It was just four months ago when a judge ruled that the far-right media outlet did, in fact, make defamatory statements about Dominion Voting Systems when it falsely claimed the company rigged votes in the 2020 presidential election, concluding that Dominion had presented “clear and convincing evidence” that the statements from Newsmax were false and would “likely cause reasonable viewers to think significantly less favorably about Dominion than if the viewers knew the truth.” That set the stage for a trial, at which point a jury would have decided whether the cable channel acted with “actual malice.” But it also opened the door to settlement negotiations, which apparently ended in an agreement. Finally, let’s not forget there’s still one big case pending: Fox News is facing a $2.7 billion lawsuit from Smartmatic, and as The New York Times reported, that case is set to proceed to trial in a Manhattan state court unless the parties reach a settlement.

Article: DENVER (AP) — The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network. “We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.” WATCH: Fox News to pay $787M settlement to Dominion Voting Systems over stolen election lies A spokesperson for Dominion said the company was pleased to have settled the lawsuit. The disclosure of the settlement came as Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies. The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. “How long are we going to play along with election fraud?” Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion’s earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network’s business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Trump’s 2020 election claims. Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey’s work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats said Monday that they were ending a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan brawl over President Donald Trump’s desire to reshape U.S. Their return will allow the Republican-run Legislature to proceed as California Democrats advance a counter-effort to redraw their congressional boundaries in retaliation — a tit-for-tat that puts the nation’s two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny their Republican-majority colleagues the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Washington. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu in a statement. The president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session agenda that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don’t have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. At the start of Monday’s hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys’ constitutional concerns. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district. But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren’t followed. The state’s lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine’s future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin.

Article: She was charged in the spring with allegedly assaulting federal officers at an immigration facility in Newark, New Jersey, while she was conducting oversight with other Democratic politicians amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. “The Department of Justice’s dismissal of prosecutions arising from the January 6 attack on the Capitol — including those of more than 160 defendants charged with violating the same statute upon which the indictment relies here — is robust evidence of unconstitutional differential treatment,” her lawyers wrote. They observed that the congresswoman’s alleged conduct was “manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray.” “There is a simple difference between this prosecution of Congresswoman McIver and the 160 cases involving assault against federal officers on January 6 that the Justice Department has dismissed: it is all about politics and partisanship,” her lawyers wrote, calling the differential treatment “precisely what the Constitution forbids.” The filing is a sobering reminder of the violence of Jan. 6 and what it says about an administration that made it a Day One priority to forgive scores of convictions (by way of clemency) and pending charges (by way of dismissals). Seeking to clear that high bar in her case, McIver, who pleaded not guilty, maintains that the DOJ “cannot pursue charges against her because she is a Democrat who conducts oversight of Executive Branch immigration policy, while dismissing charges brought under the same statute against those whose views they share and who engaged in conduct far more egregious.” The fate of McIver’s case doesn’t hinge on the success of this single motion. She filed it alongside others, including one that seeks to dismiss her case based on legislative immunity, in which her lawyers wrote that she’s charged in connection with “a congressionally authorized oversight inspection.” Legislative immunity is distinct from the presidential immunity that Trump won from the Supreme Court in his Jan. United States and its separation of powers rationale, her lawyers wrote in the immunity motion that the court’s reasoning in Trump’s case “applies with at least as much force in the context of legislative immunity,” given the latter doctrine’s concern with ensuring legislative independence.

Article: Hurricane Erin: No direct hit forecast on U.S., but flood risks prompt evacuations toggle caption National Weather Service, NOAA/ Screenshot by NPR Hurricane Erin is spinning toward the Bahamas and the U.S. It will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip currents" at beaches along much of the East Coast for the next several days, the National Hurricane Center says — and expectations of dangerous flooding are triggering evacuation orders. Erin isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but forecasters at the National Weather Service office in Morehead City, N.C., warn that areas such as North Carolina's Outer Banks should be prepared for waves as high as 15 to 20 feet or more — and to expect days of potential flooding. Sponsor Message "Coastal flooding will likely be a long duration issue, impacting Highway 12," the NWS office said, warning that parts of the main highway running along the Outer Banks could be impassible for several days. The North Carolina transportation department said a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for all visitors to Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands, adding that the order will take effect for residents early Tuesday. Officials in Hyde County, N.C., issued a state of emergency for Ocracoke Island, warning that emergency vehicles would not be able to use Highway 12 to reach and transport people in distress. The Turks and Caicos Islands were seeing waves of over 10 feet and sea swells of 8 to 12 feet, "occasionally reaching up to 17 feet this morning," the Turks and Caicos Islands National Weather Service said on Monday. The islands began the day under a tropical storm warning as Erin began to move past them to the north; the weather agency also issued a flood warning due to heavy rain. and nearby territories, Erin is raising the risk of tall waves and dangerous rip currents along the eastern coastline from Florida to Massachusetts as it moves northward, forecasters said on Monday. The Category 4 storm's core "is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States by the middle of the week," the NHC said. There are signs that the season may now be ramping up: The hurricane center says it's monitoring a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic that could develop into a storm over the next week.

Article: Russia’s illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 was quick and bloodless, and it sent Moscow’s relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War. Putin has called the peninsula “a sacred place” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine — particularly the Crimean Tatars, who strongly opposed the annexation. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court’s finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. WATCH: What to expect from Zelenskyy’s next meeting with Trump, backed by European leaders Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it. A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin called its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin’s prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022, in July 2023 and in June 2025. Those also include Ukraine ceding the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022, dropping its bid to join NATO, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population.

Article: Dominion filed a defamation suit against Newsmax in 2021 over false claims that its voting technology was used to rig the 2020 US presidential election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump. But Davis said he would leave it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. “Faced with these rulings and other constraints, Newsmax chose to settle the case.” “Newsmax has always maintained that its reporting was not defamatory and that its coverage was consistent with accepted journalistic standards,” the company said. Davis also handled the Dominion-Fox News case, and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were false. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence to prove they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time.

Article: The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) has said Air Canada’s ongoing strike, in which 10,000 cabin crew members have walked off their jobs, is illegal after strikers ignored orders to return to work. Pushing for a resolution, Carney said, “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our countries are being disrupted by this action.” The airline normally carries 130,000 people daily during the ongoing peak summer travel season and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines. The minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of the Parliament of Canada, which are on break until September 15. “The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector-workers who may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School. The previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.

Article: TEL AVIV — In the plaza that Israelis have christened “Hostage Square,” hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government. Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave’s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive.

In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. While Sunday’s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed. “Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas’s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a “toxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.” Their government’s approach appears to have the backing of Trump.

Article: Sultana: Corbyn 'capitulated' on antisemitism definition Facing criticism from Jewish groups, with the Board of Deputies of British Jews calling her words "a grave insult", Sultana posted on social media that she was a proud anti-Zionist. Speaking to the New Left Review, Sultana praised Corbynism's mass appeal, but said he "capitulated" to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, saying it "equates it with anti-Zionism". Asked how the new party would adapt the model of radical politics Corbynism set out a decade ago, Sultana said he had made "a serious mistake" in being too conciliatory. "It capitulated to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which famously equates it with anti-Zionism, and which even its lead author Kenneth Stern has now publicly criticised." Sultana added the movement was "frightened and far too conciliatory" when it was attacked and should have recognised that the state and the media "are our class enemies" because, she said, "you cannot give these people an inch". "Exaggerating his role is a tactic to give undue weight to his controversial views." Mr Hearn added he hoped Sultana would "remain on the fringes of politics for the remainder of her career, which is where her extremist views belong". The vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Andrew Gilber, said the definition was also "supported by the overwhelming majority of British Jews as it is clear and measured in defining antisemitism". "Those who seek to delegitimise and mis-define the IHRA definition in this way prove themselves to be no friend to the Jewish community and also call into question their wider commitment to anti-racism, the wellbeing of the Jewish community and social cohesion."

Zelensky’s chosen attire — a black long-sleeved polo shirt with the Ukrainian trident as a crest and matching fatigue-like trousers — became not only a talking point but, in the view of some Trump officials, a seeming symbol of his refusal to kowtow to the White House.

Article: 'SNL' castmember Bowen Yang shares a piece of 'cultural contraband' from his youth toggle caption Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP For Bowen Yang, joining SNL as a writer in 2018, and then becoming a castmember the following year, was the fulfillment of a prophesy: during his senior year of high school, Yang had been voted "Most Likely to be on SNL." Looking back now, though, he insists that the superlative was "totally incidental." "It's like their way of calling me a hammy kid, basically, which I was," he says. I would bring VHS tapes to school … and just, like, show people when there was a substitute teacher in class." Sponsor Message SNL wasn't the only show that left its mark on Yang; he initially studied chemistry and pre-med in college after becoming "obsessed" with Sandra Oh's character on Grey's Anatomy, Yang says. I actually wanted to be someone who was on TV.'" Yang says he never thought SNL would hire "an effeminate Asian man" for that show, but he was happy to be proven wrong. "Sit[ting] next to [SNL creator and executive producer] Lorne [Michaels] each week and hav[ing] him give notes on your sketch at dress rehearsal, you really develop this internal sense of, 'OK, I understand how the show works in this very underpinned way.'" In addition to his work on SNL, Yang had a part in Wicked, and is co-host of the popular podcast Las Culturistas with his friend Matt Rogers. Sponsor Message Interview highlights On growing up as the child of Chinese immigrants, and being obsessed with pop culture As a closeted Canadian kid who then moved to the States ... it was this big shock to move from French Canada — to move from Quebec — to Colorado, where I was speaking primarily French at school and Mandarin in the house, and suddenly I had to fast-track to English. … I had this visceral response to not wanting to watch that version of myself, like the person who, before he went down the chute of working at SNL, had no idea what the show was looking for. Lorne had reached out and sort of had his plan for how he wanted to cast the main players in the general election, and I was pretty resistant at first, and after a few more conversations, I think I dutifully acquiesced, and then I kind of went about it in the most child-of-immigrants way, where I hired a dialect coach, and I requested a screen test where I tried out different contact lenses, because I felt like so much of JD Vance's sort of visual eeriness was in his eyes. It was just an excuse for Matt and I to have a playdate every week, but we had done a lot of comedy together in the years leading up to it. … The awards kind of budded out of this one summer, I think in 2021, when we didn't have a guest booked that week … and that was not a common thing at the time. And so, then from that first year, we were like, "OK, so the goal is to get this televised so that everyone can opt into this." On lying as a kid that he'd seen Wicked Growing up it was this thing of like, well, if you didn't see Wicked then you have no business being a theater kid. It was really crazy how I was like, wow, this is all culminating into this moment where I'm finally seeing the show that has still meant so much to me. Sponsor Message On a piece of "cultural contraband" from his youth The only thing that I ever had to hide was a hardcover copy of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, because it was my sister's book. I was having a sexual awakening to classical art books and I highly recommend today's youth go about it the same way, because you were learning about art and you were figuring yourself out.

Article: The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in 2021 is underway Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. (Mark Weber/Daily Memphian via AP, Pool) Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world. During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti’s brother, Anthony “Big Jook” Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph’s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were “looking for somebody” and “didn’t know who we were going to catch.” They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph’s car. At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Jermarcus Johnson, who pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the killing, acknowledged helping his half-brother and Smith communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, “King of Memphis.” He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. In a 2024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a “very senseless murder” and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.

Article: The Canadian Industrial Relations Board declared the strike by Air Canada's flight attendants "unlawful" Monday morning and ordered union leaders to direct the flight attendants to return to work, according to an update from Air Canada. At the center of the dispute are salary negotiations between Air Canada and the CUPE flight attendants union, which says the carrier's wages are below inflation, market value and the federal minimum wage. "CUPE illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy the direction from the CIRB to return to work resulting in Air Canada suspending its plan to resume limited flying by Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge," Air Canada said in a statement.

Article: Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa attend a press conference during their visit to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, in Rafah, Egypt, August 18, 2025. Hamas has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal with Israel that includes the return of half the hostages held in Gaza and Israel's release of some Palestinian prisoners, an Egyptian official source said on Monday. Israel's plans to seize control of Gaza City in the heart of the Palestinian enclave have stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis on Sunday held some of the largest protests since the war began, urging a deal to end the fighting and free the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Thousands of Palestinians fearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory. In an apparent show of force on Monday, Israeli tanks advanced into the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, according to witnesses who counted the presence of at least nine tanks and bulldozers. Israel's Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, said his country was at a turning point in the Gaza war, "with its focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City," the military spokesman said in a statement. In a video issued by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "I, like you, hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure." The Egyptian official source stated that the proposal accepted by Hamas included a suspension of Israeli military operations for 60 days and outlined a framework for a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-old conflict. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister, joined the discussions on Monday and met both Egyptian President el-Sisi and Hamas representatives, said an official briefed on the meetings. Israel approved the plan to take control of Gaza City earlier this month, but officials had said it could take weeks to start, leaving the door open for a ceasefire, even though Netanyahu had said it would get under way "fairly quickly" and end the war with Hamas' defeat.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump expressed hope that their critical meeting Monday with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine. troops to the effort, saying instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence but that all those details would be hashed out in their afternoon meeting with EU leaders. “I think its very important to get the deal done.” WATCH: Zelenskyy brings Europe’s top leaders with him to meet Trump on ending Russia’s war Trump’s engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. Here’s what to know “So let me just say three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections, oh, I wonder what the fake news would say,” Trump said. Monday’s hastily assembled meeting comes after Trump met on Friday with Putin and has said that the onus is now on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land that he said could end the war. The two will later gather with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy responded with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” Zelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.” The European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. Ahead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. ‘A very big move’ European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.

Article: Health officials declared the outbreak over after more than 42 days without a new case, a cut-off based on the time between when a person is exposed to when they get sick. In late January, a cluster of cases was reported in western Texas near Gaines County -- near the border with New Mexico -- which had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state. Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images, FILE "I want to highlight the tireless work of the public health professionals across the state who contributed to the containment of one of the most contagious viruses," Dr. "We arrived at this point through a comprehensive outbreak response that included testing, vaccination, disease monitoring and educating the public about measles through awareness campaigns." Texas health officials warned that the state is likely to experience additional cases this year given ongoing outbreaks in other parts of the U.S. The virus was declared eliminated by health officials in 2000 after a full year of no continuous spread, but declining vaccination rates have led to a growing number of outbreaks annually, experts say. "Vaccination rates in many communities remain far too low, leaving large pockets of children vulnerable to measles and other preventable diseases -- and that's why we're likely to continue seeing outbreaks," Brownstein said. The 2024-2025 school year had a record number of non-medical vaccine exemptions, with an estimated 286,000 kindergarteners attending school without documentation of receiving the shot that protects against measles, according to CDC data. "Measles isn't happening in isolation -- we're seeing a broader resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, from pertussis to polio threats, which underscores the urgent need to maintain high vaccination coverage and public trust in immunization," Brownstein added.

Article: DALLAS — Almost a dozen Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives refused to return to the state capitol on Monday with their colleagues despite the legislature now having enough members present for a quorum and to conduct business. The holdouts remain in suburban Chicago in a symbolic standoff against Governor Abbott who called the Texas legislature into a special legislative session to redraw congressional lines that will help President Trump keep control of Congress through the 2026 mid-term elections. I am focused on ensuring California passes its own maps which they must do by this coming Friday to ensure they nullify Trump and Abbott's power grab in Texas,” said state Rep. “But let me be clear: If Donald Trump and Greg Abbott bring their anti-Austin, anti-American redistricting scheme to the floor of the Texas House, I will return to represent my constituents and vote NO.” Despite the holdout, there were still enough Democrats who returned to the House chamber on Monday at 12 p.m. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep. Wu said last week that the quorum break would end if two conditions were met; the first special session ended and California introduced its own legislation to counteract what Texas Republicans want to do. The members who returned to the House chamber on Monday were released into the custody of a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper who will remain with them until the chamber reconvenes on Wednesday 10 a.m.

Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses," Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement Monday. Prior to their return, some Texas officials had called for federal help to locate out-of-state Democrats and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had sought to declare some of the absent lawmakers' seats vacant, among other efforts. We'll move quickly and the schedule will be demanding until our work is complete." After the House gaveled in Monday, House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced a quorum was present and said civil arrest warrants remain in place for lawmakers who remain out of state. Because breaking quorum is not a crime, federal authorities don't have means to compel lawmakers to return to the Texas Capitol, but within state lines, the lawmakers could be placed under civil arrest and brought back to Capitol.

It is the first time a former senior Israeli military figure has been heard endorsing a high Palestinian death toll in Israel's nearly two-year-long offensive in Gaza, saying it was "necessary." The date the remarks were made was not broadcast. Israeli politicians have previously made incendiary calls about "erasing" Gaza and fighting "human animals" — rhetoric that has since been cited at the International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa as evidence Israel is pursuing genocide, which Israel denies.

Article: In this article TGT HD WMT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT watch now As more tariffs take effect on goods imported into the U.S., a specific accounting method could have major implications for how American retailers calculate the impact. "This would normalize once tariffs stabilize, depending on how much of the cost retailers absorb." Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across a broad group of items, rather than the actual cost of every item, like in cost accounting, RIM does not entirely capture the immediate impact of rising costs. TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen estimated about half of Walmart's quarter will include the impact of levies, as the company brought in inventory at different cost levels before and after new tariff rates took effect. A week after Trump's April 2 announcement of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" on a wide swath of trade partners, Walmart withdrew its guidance for operating income in its first fiscal quarter. Jason Fochtman | Houston Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty Images Then when it reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Walmart said it would mitigate higher costs as much as possible, but would likely have to increase some prices at the current tariff rates. Walmart management briefed Trump this spring about the impact its accounting method may have on results in a high-tariff environment, according to a person familiar with the discussion, who asked to remain unnamed while speaking about private conversations. Still, James Bowie, managing director in EY's technical accounting advisory group, warned "all of the inventory costing methodologies will be affected in some ways." An employee folds towel at a Manhattan retail store on July 15, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images It typically takes a large, non-fast fashion retailer using RIM roughly two to four quarters for cost volatility to settle and profitability to get closer to its true level, according to PwC. It takes a little longer for it to turn and so even though they might ultimately be able to go the same speed, it takes a little bit of time for that one turn to take place." While RIM is more likely to lead to a temporary overstating of profitability, it can also wind up understanding profits if tariffs are negotiated lower. Bowie said if a retailer responds to lower tariff rates by cutting retail prices, under RIM accounting, "it looks like my margin has eroded, but it's only because I now am waiting for the cost relationship to catch back up, so [it] might look like there's margin compression even in a period of decreasing tariffs." Furman added that PwC is seeing "a clear disconnect" for companies that use RIM accounting. "[A retailer] had an abacus and a dream trying to figure out what you're going to do." Over time, technology made it easy to use actual costs rather than averages, so cost accounting became more common. CNBC US source For the purposes of this example, PwC and CNBC used weighted average cost accounting, which takes a SKU-level weight average and blends all costs together, regardless of purchase date. CNBC US source Tariff case 1: Retailer's costs increase, all else remains the same If the retailer's cost for each T-shirt goes up as a result of tariffs, but everything else — units bought, units sold and retail price — remains the same, gross margin falls if calculated using cost accounting and RIM. CNBC US source Tariff case 2: Retailer raises prices to offset higher costs If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of the tariff cost to the customer, and units bought and sold stay the same, gross margin improves under both accounting methods. Tariff case 3: Retailer raises prices and units bought and sold both fall Here's where it gets interesting, and likely more realistic, to reflect supply and demand choices a retailer and consumer would likely make as costs rise. If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of tariffs to the customer and also sells fewer items to consumers at the higher retail price, RIM makes profit margins look temporarily rosier.

Article: More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in its nearly two-year genocidal war on Gaza, with the population suffering relentless bombardment with nowhere safe in the besieged enclave, Israeli-induced starvation and the daily killing of people desperately seeking food for their families. Israel is intensifying strikes on Gaza City, the territory’s largest – and now destroyed – urban centre, as it plans to seize it and forcibly displace tens of thousands of people to concentration zones in the south. The scale of attacks illustrates how Israel’s current strategy is shaping the geography and demography of Gaza.” “We can see how Israel is using heavy artillery, fighter jets and drones, in order to destroy what’s left of residential homes there. People there say Israeli attacks are happening day and night.” Many who have already been displaced multiple times during the war by Israeli bombardment are on the move again from Gaza City. Advertisement But while many Palestinians who remain in the devastated city are forced to survive in the ruins of buildings, makeshift shelters, or tents, some people have told Al Jazeera that it would be impossible for them to leave. “We want them to [allow] us back to the homes we fled – we don’t need more than that.” Slight hope emerged as Hamas said it approved a Gaza ceasefire proposal put forward yesterday by mediators Qatar and Egypt. An informed source told Al Jazeera that the draft deal would ensure a 60-day truce that would see the release of half of the Israeli captives held in Gaza as well as an unspecified number of Palestinian captives imprisoned by Israel. But Palestinians in Gaza have seen countless false dawns before, and after a brief ceasefire in January was shattered by Israel in March, the war then entered its most grim phase of human misery. ‘Israel carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation’ Gaza’s Health Ministry says five more Palestinians have died from malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing monthslong blockade in the past 24 hours, including two children. The United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) warned that as of July 2025, more than 320,000 children – the entire population under the age of five in Gaza – are at risk of acute malnutrition. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says children in Gaza should be preparing for the new school year, but instead are searching for water, queuing for food, and living in classrooms turned into overcrowded shelters. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” Advertisement In the meantime, Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says its staff in Gaza are witnessing a surge in mass casualties linked to Israel’s ongoing siege and its oversight of limited distribution of aid by the controversial, US- and Israel-backed aid organisation GHF. “The indiscriminate killings, and the counts of mass casualties we still [see] on a daily basis right now, hasn’t stopped, but only increased in its scale,” said Nour Alsaqqa of MSF. “They go out of desperation and they risk their lives to access aid, which is still inaccessible due to Israel’s siege.” Since the establishment of the GHF aid sites at the end of May, nearly 2,000 people have been killed while trying to access aid, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Article: Satellite internet service Starlink, which is owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, appeared to suffer a brief network outage on Monday, with thousands of reports of service interruptions on Downdetector, a site that logs tech issues. The network's July 24 outage lasted for several hours, with SpaceX Vice President of Starlink Engineering Michael Nicolls blaming the matter on "failure of key internal software services that operate the core network" behind Starlink. SpaceX provides Starlink internet service to more than six million users across 140 countries, according to the company's website, though churn and subscriber rates are not publicly reported by the company.

Article: The Wall Street Journal, citing a European official and another person also involved in planning the summit, reported that the "White House has asked that Zelensky don a suit and tie to meet the president." But when Zelenskyy showed up at the White House, he appeared to have bucked that reported request. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images file As Trump welcomed Zelenskyy to the Oval Office for that meeting in February, he panned his Ukrainian counterpart for his outfit by saying he was "all dressed up today.” At one point a reporter from the right-wing Real America’s Voice network asked Zelenskyy why he wasn't wearing a suit and said, “You’re at the highest level in this country’s office, and you refuse to wear a suit." Zelenskyy replied, “I will wear costume after this war will finish." (He also quipped: “Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don’t know.") The outfit Zelenskyy wore Monday seems to be his attempt to thread the needle between maintaining his independence while showing a bit of receptivity to pressure from the White House — and trying to get the best possible peace deal for Ukraine. But if the White House considered its demand that Zelenskyy conform to its sartorial wishes a test, Zelenskyy appears to have shown he was only willing to go part of the way.

Article: Nearly a year ago, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off in their first and only presidential debate, and when the discussion turned to Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Democratic vice president told her Republican rival what he didn’t want to hear. As NBC News summarized: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from a nearly three-hour meeting on the Ukraine war and struck a cordial tone in brief public statements, but left without announcing a ceasefire or peace agreement. John McCain, a month before his death, went so far as to call Trump’s appearance in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” But the second summit was, by most measures, even worse — because as the American president acknowledged, the stakes were vastly higher. Chris Murphy of Connecticut explained, simply, “Putin got everything he wanted.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point: Trump handed Putin a victory before the summit even began by extending an invitation and giving the Russian leader the legitimacy he’s craved. Trump handed Putin a public relations victory in Alaska, literally rolling out the red carpet for the dictator, literally applauding him, welcoming him into the presidential limo, and treating Putin with deference, even letting the Russian leader speak first (and longer) at their pseudo press conference. Trump handed Putin a strategic victory by abandoning the White House’s own policy: The American president said he’s no longer seeking a ceasefire as a precursor to broader negotiations — the policy Trump spent months trying to secure — which necessarily strengthens Moscow’s hand. “For all the promises of a cease-fire, of severe economic consequences, of being disappointed, it took two minutes on the red carpet and 10 minutes in the Beast for Putin to play Trump again. When Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked the American president to rate the talks on a scale of 1 to 10, Trump replied, “I think the meeting was a 10, in the sense we got along great.” And if the point of the talks were for Trump and Putin to “get along great,” then it was certainly a triumph, but in Grown-Up Land, there were other objectives on the to-do list. “We’re not walking out of there with a deal,” a White House official told Politico ahead of the summit — hours before they walked out of there without a deal. As this week gets underway, Zelenskyy will meet with the American president in the White House, and he’s bringing some backup: The Ukrainian leader will be joined by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, U.K.

Article: Under normal circumstances, no one would think to ask the Pentagon whether the current secretary of defense supports women’s voting rights, but there’s little about our current political landscape that’s “normal.” Hence, The Hill reported: The Trump administration on Thursday sought to clarify Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s support for women’s voting rights following controversy spurred by his repost of a video tied to a pastor who said the opposite. I can appreciate why the DOD’s right-wing spokesperson — someone who, as Politico reported earlier this year, “has touted antisemitic views, white supremacist conspiracy theories and Kremlin-like statements on social media” — would be eager to dismiss the line of inquiry. In fact, it was just two weeks ago when Hegseth used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, but he also didn’t make any effort to distance himself from the rhetoric used in the video he shared with his online followers. On the contrary, he promoted the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” When this sparked a controversy, the former Fox News host could’ve made it clear that he disagreed with the comments, or that he supports leaving the 19th Amendment intact. When asked about the video he promoted, a Pentagon spokesperson told the AP that Hegseth is “a proud member of a church” that is affiliated with CREC and he “very much appreciates many of Mr.

Article: Richard Schlueter, 56, was planting cucumbers and squash in his community garden plot in Greensboro, Georgia, in May when he tore open a bag of soil and heard a pop. That day, he called a medical team at the National Institutes of Health that had created an experimental cell therapy, custom-made to attack his cancer as part of a clinical trial. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A week later, Schlueter and his wife, Michelle, saw NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya push back on concerns raised by his own staff that the ouster of essential employees and other disruptions to the biomedical research agency were harming science and patients. But on June 3, his NIH doctor informed him that it would now take eight to 10 weeks because of cuts to essential lab personnel — a painful illustration of the life-or-death stakes of the administration’s approach to shrinking the government workforce. You can imagine the difficulty as we have to tell them these things.” An official with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, said the agency had ways of addressing the delays. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A scan and biopsy showed it was head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but an oncologist told him it was treatable, with an excellent chance of success. He read the NIH credo — to improve the human condition throughout the world — emblazoned on a wall of the Clinical Center and was so moved that he sent a photo of it to his three children. Advertisement Advertisement “The staff, the physicians, the amount of empathy, care and mission that I’ve experienced over four visits to their research hospital has been just super gratifying,” Richard said. Two scientists on Rosenberg’s team who have specialized skills to prepare cells for immunotherapy trials were among the thousands of probationary employees fired in the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal workforce. Advertisement The one who would have finalized Richard’s infusion had worked at NIH since 2020 and was recently hired as a full-time employee because she was considered so effective, according to Rosenberg. Ferris, a head and neck surgical oncologist at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, said patients such as Richard have tough and tragic cases where standard medical care has been exhausted. “If he misses [it], not only is it is it devastating for his family, but it’s devastating for all the patients behind him that could have learned something scientifically — on why it was successful or not successful,” Michelle said. “He’s like a test pilot.” UPDATE: After Richard Schlueter shared his story with The Post, NIH was able to rehire the scientist who prepares the cells for the immunotherapy trial, and he was able to receive his treatment.

It was unclear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel would accept the proposal, which came as Qatar and Egypt were intensifying their mediation efforts ahead of a possible Israeli ground invasion into Gaza City. The plan would also require Israel to redeploy its forces in Gaza, and it would allow enough humanitarian aid to enter the territory to meet the needs of Palestinians, two of the officials said. The latest terms are similar to those that Israel had previously accepted and they include both a temporary cease-fire and a path to an agreement to end the war, according to the two diplomats and the Egyptian official.

Article: “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife," a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and "delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: Key takeaways so far from Ukraine talks in Washington 11 minutes ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from the White House Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save Watch: Key moments from Zelensky-Trump White House talks Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to the White House on Monday to meet US President Donald Trump for fresh talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Follow live updates on this story Zelensky launches charm offensive Given his acrimonious last visit to the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president went to considerable lengths to be collegial and charm his American hosts - including a flurry of six "thank yous" within the first few minutes of the meeting. The last time he was at the White House, Zelensky was scolded by Vice-President JD Vance for a perceived lack of gratitude for US support for Ukraine during the war. This time, Zelensky was dressed in a dark suit rather than his traditional military garb, and appeared well prepared with a joke when asked about his outfit by the same reporter who had previously criticised him for not wearing a suit to the Oval Office. After the reporter told him that he looked "fabulous", Zelensky shot back that he was wearing the "same suit" as last time, eliciting laughter from the reporters, Trump and other officials in the room. Reuters The pair presented a warmer front on Monday - with comedian-turned-politician Zelensky joking about their first, acrimonious meeting Zelensky also sought to play to Trump's family during the meeting, handing the US president a letter from Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to Melania Trump. The delivery of the letter comes just days after Trump hand-delivered a letter from Melania to Vladimir Putin while in Alaska, in which she called on Putin to protect "the innocence" of children and "nurture the next generation's hope". And she says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow, because so many people have been killed." Trump hints at security guarantees One of the questions put to Zelensky was about what he would need from the US to guarantee his country's security. In a moment that conveyed the sense of urgency he seemingly tried to suppress throughout much of the press conference, Zelensky leaned forward in his chair and said, emphatically: "Everything." "We need a strong Ukrainian army," he added. But the lack of detail on what exactly these guarantees might consist of is concerning to both Kyiv and Europe, and behind closed doors leaders will no doubt try to impress on Trump that the US deterrent needs to be more than just symbolic.

Article: See today's video update from Mike above.) Stocks are idling to start a new week, holding just below record highs as Wall Street awaits some potentially consequential updates on the consumer and Federal Reserve policy. The S & P 500 was nearly flat, sitting in its narrowest daily range of the year, holding tight to its closing level both from Friday and last Tuesday, the day that a mostly benign Consumer Price Index report for July solidified expectations for a Fed rate cut next month. A modest majority of stocks were up on the day Monday, the equal-weighted S & P 500 barely was in the green, with the longtime laggard Russell 2000 small-cap gauge lifting by about 0.3%. Meta Platforms was by far the biggest drag on the S & P 500, down 2.2%, apparently on a report in The Information detailing another restructuring of its AI efforts, perhaps exacerbated by OpenAI founder Sam Altman granting that some AI investing activity is looking a bit bubbly. Ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium late this week, the Street is getting itself wound pretty tight over how Chair Jay Powell might characterize the chances of a September cut. On the one hand, circumstances are plausibly converging around one idea: In June, FOMC officials anticipated two more rate cuts by year end and there are only three more meetings. On the other hand, Powell probably has little incentive to commit firmly given high lame-duck status and the fact that more employment and inflation numbers will hit before the September meeting.

Article: A woman has sued a Florida dairy farm linked by state officials to an outbreak of infections from consuming raw milk, claiming she lost her unborn child while caring for her toddler who got sick from the milk. Rachel Maddox claimed she didn’t know about the risks involved with raw milk and her child became seriously sick after consuming the product, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Seminole County. Now she’s suing Keely Farms Dairy, a farm in New Smyrna Beach, which the Florida Department of Health earlier this month said was linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. At the time, the Florida Department of Health said it was working with the farm to ensure “effective sanitation practices are implemented consistently across every batch.” In the suit, Maddox claimed she purchased Keely Farms Dairy raw milk at Wild Hare Natural Market in June of this year when she was nearly 20 weeks pregnant. Maddox and her husband began to provide the milk to their toddler, identified by the initials L.U., but after consuming the raw milk on June 8, 2025, the lawsuit alleges L.U. They took the toddler to Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children on June 9 “for the first of what would be three emergency room visits and hospitalizations in the next several weeks,” the suit said. STEC bacteria in the most severe form can also result in hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure and is particularly concerning for children, the Florida Health Department said.

Article: A transgender distance runner is suing the NCAA and her former college, alleging they violated state and federal law by barring her from the women’s track and field team because of her gender identity. Evie Parts, who graduated from Swarthmore College in May, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday accusing the NCAA and the school of violating Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education. For two months this year, the complaint says, Swarthmore told Parts she had to compete as part of the men’s team or run unattached to the school, meaning she could not access its services for athletes, including transportation and medical care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The ultimatum pushed Parts into a severe “depressive state” and she “in one moment told a friend that she wanted to kill herself,” the lawsuit states. Advertisement Parts’s removal from the team came after the NCAA changed its transgender athlete policy, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth — a measure most Americans generally support. The NCAA revised the policy to comport with President Donald Trump’s executive order stating that schools would be denied Title IX funding if they allowed transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. She argues that by following rules from the NCAA — a private, nongovernmental organization — and excluding her from competing with the women’s track team, Swarthmore disregarded Title IX and Pennsylvania law, which bars discrimination based on gender identity. Her lawsuit calls the NCAA’s revision a “bigoted policy that subjected transgender women to segregation and ridicule.” In a statement Monday, Swarthmore said it worked with Parts during “a time of rapidly evolving guidance, while balancing the ability for other members of the women’s track team to compete in NCAA events.” Advertisement “We recognize that this is an especially difficult and painful time for members of the transgender community, including student-athletes,” Swarthmore said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Under Trump, schools across the country have been forced to navigate Education Department probes and new policies targeting transgender students, the facilities they use and the sports they play. Over the next few weeks, Parts competed in at least one race as an unattached athlete, paying the entry fee, driving herself there and buying her own jersey to wear because she could not wear the Swarthmore uniform, according to the complaint. During the race, the filing states, Parts wore arm sleeves with the jersey to “hide the razor marks on her arms because she did not want her teammates nor her parents to see the incisions that she inflicted on herself.” Ahead of another race in April, Parts hired an attorney to help ensure that she could run unattached, the lawsuit says.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we have the latest on President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Republicans’ redistricting plans in Texas now that a group of Democratic lawmakers have returned home. — Adam Wollner Trump and Zelenskyy signal progress as they meet with European leaders on Ukraine war By Peter Nicholas, Megan Lebowitz and Kristen Welker President Donald Trump met for about an hour at the White House today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an accelerating effort to end the grinding war with Russia on terms acceptable to both sides. Trump greeted the Ukrainian leader in the early afternoon with a smile and warm handshake — a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office. Fresh off a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump summoned Zelenskyy to see if they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine’s future security and the status of territory that the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine. A number of European leaders joined Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House to work toward a breakthrough in the nearly three-and-a-half-year conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if allowed to persist. (At Zelenskyy’s last meeting at the White House, a reporter asked him why he wasn’t wearing a suit.) When his meeting with Trump ended, Zelenskyy said: “We had a very good conversation — maybe the best one.” What happens next is far from clear. Depending on the progress made, he said he would try to convene a meeting that hasn’t happened since the war began — a trilateral summit with himself, Putin and Zelenskyy.

Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying the Republicans’ pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday. takeover: Some Republicans governors announced over the weekend that they are sending their states’ National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to supplement Trump’s effort to combat crime in the nation’s capital.

Article: RAFAH, Egypt — Hamas said Monday it has accepted a new proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as Israel indicated its positions haven't changed, while Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000.

Article: in bioinformatics, and I could be making a lot more money in Silicon Valley, which is only a few hours away, but I made career choices to position myself in Yosemite National Park, because this is the place that I love the most.” SJ Joslin was a park ranger and wildlife biologist for Yosemite who studied bats. Courtesy SJ Joslin When asked for comment on Joslin’s termination, a spokesperson for Yosemite National Park said the National Park Service, which oversees Yosemite, “is pursuing administrative action against multiple National Park Service employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” The spokesperson did not immediately respond to an additional question about which regulations the employees allegedly violated. Joslin, who is 35 and had been going to the park for years prior to working there, has written Yosemite climbing guidebooks and volunteered to work overtime to help issue hiking permits and manage traffic in the park. Joslin said they came up with the idea to hang the trans pride flag on El Capitan in the spring after President Donald Trump issued a variety of executive orders targeting trans people, including orders to change the federal definition of sex to exclude trans identities, restrict access to trans health care and prohibit trans women from competing in female sports. Jayce Kolinski Joslin said the flag display, which they organized with other LGBTQ climbers and advocates and participated in outside of work hours, was intended to celebrate trans people and show that everyone is welcome in the nation’s parks. The flag was up on El Capitan for about two hours when park officials told the climbers to remove it, though the climbers said at the time that they were not told that they had broken any park rules. Courtesy SJ Joslin There was no policy prohibiting the display of flags on El Capitan until the day after Joslin and their team hung the trans flag, when the National Park Service issued a new rule banning the hanging of large flags in wilderness areas. “Hanging flags has been a tradition that climbers have done on El Cap for decades, and that’s both individuals who are visiting the park, but also employees that are on their off time,” Joslin said. I’m the only one who’s been fired for it.” Joslin said two other NPS employees, including one who works in Yosemite and another who works in a different park, are under investigation for helping to display the trans flag. They plan to seek legal counsel to try to contest the decision, citing an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his presidency to protect free speech and end federal censorship. “I think that everyone as Americans should be upset about this, and it doesn’t matter who I am or what my identity is, this is a matter of free speech.”

Article: A ticket-reselling operation used a network of fake accounts to bypass Ticketmaster’s security protocols to grab hundreds of thousands of tickets to hugely popular tours for artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen and then re-sold them for millions, federal regulators said Monday. In total, the group is accused of buying 321,286 tickets to 3,261 live performances from June 2022 to December 2023, in bunches of 15 or more tickets to each event at a total cost of approximately $46.7 million and then reselling them for $52.4 million, netting approximately $5.7 million. That includes $1.2 million from reselling tickets in 2023 for Taylor Swift’s record-breaking “The Eras Tour.” In one instance, the suspects used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets for Swift’s March 2023 tour stop in Las Vegas, vastly exceeding Ticketmaster’s six-ticket limit, which they then sold for $120,000, the FTC alleges. The FTC says the defendants at one point printed up flyers in places like Baltimore claiming that participants could “make money doing verified van sign ups” in just “3 easy steps,” earning $5 for the account creation and $5 to $20 each time they received a Verified Fan presale code. It was subsequently forced to postpone the sale date for the general public seeking tickets to Swift’s tour “due to demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory.” In response, Swift alluded to broken “trust” with Ticketmaster, though she didn’t name it directly. “It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties, and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse,” she wrote in an Instagram message in 2022, adding: “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.” Springsteen said in a statement at the time that “ticket buying has gotten very confusing, not just for the fans, but for the artists also” but that most of his tickets are “totally affordable.” In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order focused on curbing exploitative ticket reselling practices that raise costs for fans. Ferguson said Trump's order made clear "that unscrupulous middlemen who harm fans and jack up prices through anticompetitive methods will hear from us.” “Today’s action puts brokers on notice that the Trump-Vance FTC will police operations that unlawfully circumvent ticket sellers’ purchase limits, ensuring that consumers have an opportunity to buy tickets at fair prices,” he said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether that suit is still active, but in July, Ticketmaster and Live Nation sued the FTC to block the investigation, saying that ticket purchases on its site did not use automated software, or bots, and did not violate the 2016 Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act. Strangely, in the latest complaint, the FTC includes a slide from an internal Ticketmaster presentation from 2018 that suggests the company was weighing the economic impact of imposing stricter purchasing caps that would curb bots but potentially hurt its finances. On a page labeled “evaluating potential actions” a data table is shown under the heading “serious negative economic impact if we move to 8 ticket limit across the board.” It also includes an email from one of the defendants in which he “owns up” to having exceeded the ticket-purchase limit for a May 2024 Bad Bunny show in Miami and offers to have the orders canceled, to which a Ticketmaster rep simply responds that “as long as the purchases were made using different accounts and cards, it’s within the guidelines.” Efforts to reach the three defendants — Taylor Kurth, Elan Rozmaryn and Yair Rozmaryn — named in the suit announced Monday were unsuccessful.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article Gilbert Dryden probably only has enough medication to get him through the end of October, his mother, Madison, figures. “This drug totally saves the lives of babies.” After a more than decade-long process to bring the drug to market, the treatment’s approval has repeatedly hit roadblocks with the Food and Drug Administration. “It’s the highest level of desperation.” On Monday, Stealth announced that it did submit its third application for approval of elamipretide — asking for an accelerated pathway under a significantly tighter timeline than what the agency initially recommended. In October 2024, an advisory committee to the FDA voted 10-6 in support of the therapy, paving the way for the agency to clear the first drug to treat Barth syndrome. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, wrote in an email that the “FDA did carefully consider the advice of the advisory committee members, including their rationale for their vote. While there is often a high rate of agreement between FDA and advisory committee recommendations,” the spokesman said, “there is not always concordance.” ‘Compelling medical need’ for approval After the advisory committee’s recommendation, the FDA’s rejection was unexpected. But the former official was quick to point out that given the advisory committee recommendation for approval, the “incredibly compelling medical need” of those living with Barth syndrome and the small sample of individuals who seemed to have benefited from the treatment, it certainly appeared that elamipretide was going to make it across the finish line. “And I think that’s led to an adverse outcome for some of these rare disease products.” The HHS spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request Monday for comment about the agency’s rejection of the drug or leadership issues. A Wall Street Journal Op-Ed recently offered a scathing evaluation of what’s happening at the FDA, questioning whether the agency and Commissioner Marty Makary’s stated goal of accelerating lifesaving drugs is matching the reality of their actions. The Journal said that there were averages of 52 annual drug approvals under the first Trump administration and 48 under President Joe Biden, but “there have been only 22 in the first seven months of this year,” projecting to just 38 for the year. “We’re going to have to watch them really closely because they’re at risk for recurrence of heart failure and rehospitalization and potentially decompensation to the point where they have to live in the hospital until they could get a heart transplant.” A transplant addresses the heart problem but doesn’t alleviate ongoing muscular and skeletal problems. “In fact, for Barth Syndrome, this elamipretide is really the only drug that we know of that works.” Carter said that there are six families in Georgia alone he’s been in contact with who have a loved one with the rare disease. After the recent FDA decision, Carter told NBC News in a statement that he’s “disappointed” with the recommendation “now that all issues appear to be resolved.” Carter said he’s continuing to put pressure on the FDA and that “patients will suffer with further delays.” He also acknowledged that the economics of a private company, like Stealth, attempting to continue developing a drug for such a small population of patients would be exceedingly difficult without FDA backing. Madison Dryden and her husband are left with what they call a “giant unknown” in the absence of approval, struggling for an explanation for their 7- and 3-year-old daughters as families are in a race against time to keep loved ones alive. “They know that somebody is not giving permission for Gilbert to have his medicine, and that they keep saying no, and they’re our kids — like they can’t lose … we can’t have them lose their baby brother to this,” she said.

Article: Last week, following the attempted carjacking of one of his staffers, Donald Trump deployed federal troops to Washington, D.C., to combat what he called an “out of control” crime wave in the city. “There’s no spike in crime that we’re experiencing in Washington, D.C., and even then, what is it exactly that the National Guard will do to quell that?” Fanone said that while there is value in federal and local forces working together to combat crime, what is unfolding in D.C. That place is not having roving bands of officers in tactical gear, aimlessly walking around.” Fanone said Trump is using federal agents to create “the optics of an occupying force” and spread “fear.” “Citizens don’t want to feel as though they’re occupied. Fanone didn’t direct his ire just at Trump, he also accused federal law enforcement agents — particularly ICE — of being complicit in the president’s overreach, calling the agency “Donald Trump’s Police Department.” Fanone said he had a simple message for “everyone in the law enforcement community that’s being co-opted by the Trump administration to do things that are immoral, unethical and, in many cases, unconstitutional: Quit your job.” “There’s a lot of other jobs out there,” Fanone said. “I quit my job at the police department, and I got to tell you, when it comes to law enforcement, the grass is always greener somewhere else.” You can watch Fanone’s full reaction in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: READ MORE: ‘Brain rot’ is Oxford’s word of the year “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife,” a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and “delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: In two lawsuits filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the Tate brothers accuse TikTok and Meta of defaming and unlawfully “deplatforming” them by removing their social media accounts. The lawsuits, which are largely identical, claim the removals of their accounts were “not an isolated enforcement action grounded in neutral application of its Terms of Use, rather, it was the culmination of a coordinated campaign to suppress, silence, and destroy the reputations and livelihoods of two controversial but law-abiding men.” The brothers also allege that the “deplatforming” was done without notice or explanation and that it violated contractual agreements and stripped them of their main sources of revenue. Their brand and business model relied heavily on their social media engagement, the lawsuits say, and their removals from the platforms led to “substantial and irreplaceable financial loss and damage.” TikTok and Meta “inflicted” “substantial financial, reputational, and emotional harm,” according to the lawsuit. In May, the U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service charged both brothers with rape, human trafficking and other crimes, leading Romanian courts to issue an order to extradite them to the U.K. In 2023, they filed a defamation suit in Palm Beach County, Florida, Circuit Court against people they claim provided false evidence to Romanian authorities and conspired to deceive officials to have them wrongfully imprisoned. The Tates’ lawsuits note that while they were “arrested in Romania and placed under house arrest in connection with criminal investigations, neither was, or has been, convicted of human trafficking or sexual exploitation.” “Despite this, TikTok and other actors repeatedly invoked these allegations to justify censorship and reputational damage, again with no opportunity for Plaintiffs to question or dispel such false and malicious accusations,” the lawsuits say. Andrew Tate has previously pushed back against the criticisms of his online presence, telling NBC News in November 2022 that he is playing an “online character.” He said at the time that he makes “many videos praising women” and that his coaching involves teaching men “to avoid toxic people as a whole.” Tate said he tells his audience to avoid “low value people,” including “toxic men.” Andrew Tate wrote Sunday on X that he is shelling out money (he says “400,000,000 of personal funds”) to battle the platforms and those who tried to “cancel” him, including “mainstream media across Australia UK and USA,” as well as “every single girl who lied about me.” “It’s good vs evil and I will lose my entire fortune in this fight,” he wrote to his nearly 11 million followers. “I’m happy to go broke and live on the street trying to beat The Matrix.” The brothers seek more than $50 million in compensatory damages from each company, according to the respective lawsuits.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/national-guard-dc-trump-republican-governors-ohio-rcna225606
Article: In one sense, the decisions of the governors of Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia to send National Guard troops from their states to aid President Donald Trump’s authoritarian takeover of Washington, D.C., should not have surprised anyone. Patrick Morrisey proclaimed such allegiance when he signed three pieces of legislation that his office said were “meant to protect the 2nd Amendment rights of West Virginians.” Morrisey said at the time: “As Governor, I will always support and defend West Virginians’ God-given constitutional rights. The bills I signed today further enshrine West Virginia’s strong support for the Second Amendment.” This is not the first time that President Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. But let’s compare the decisions of Morrissey, South Carolina’s Henry McMaster, Mississippi's Tate Reeves and Ohio’s Mike DeWine to deploy their states’ National Guard with the language of the Second Amendment. It reads, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Note why the militia is needed: for the “security of a free State” [emphasis added]. The governors were eager to make clear that they, as McMaster explained, stand "with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital.” Or take Morrisey, who said, “West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital.” This is not the first time that Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. While red states jumped to answer the president’s call, governors and Guard commanders in blue states were incredulous.” “The result,” the Post continues, “was a deployment to the nation’s capital that military historians say appears to have been without precedent: Over 98 percent of the 3,800 troops that arrived in the District came from states with Republican governors.” Five years later, the deployment of troops from Trump-loving states in the District of Columbia, where every one of Trump’s Democratic opponents has received over 90% of the vote and where Blacks make up almost 45% of the population, is no less disturbing. The drafters of the Declaration of Independence included among the British monarchy’s “repeated injuries and usurpations” the following: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures; He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power;” and kept “large bodies of armed troops among us.” That’s why people like Alexander Hamilton thought it was important that states have their own military force. “If standing armies,” he wrote, “are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions.” Hamilton hoped that militias controlled by the states would be all that would be necessary to assure peace in the new Republic and did not think that they ever would threaten liberty. Whatever their views on whether the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms, historians generally agree that one of the key purposes of the amendment was to ensure that states had the resources needed to resist encroachments on liberty perpetrated by the federal government. As Supreme Court Justice James McReynolds put it in 1939, “In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier.” Troops from Ohio, South Carolina, Mississippi and West Virginia deployed in Washington are being asked to display the character of soldiers, not that of the “neighbors” that Hamilton envisioned. Hamilton thought that there would be no danger “from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits, and interests.” Sending members of state National Guards to a place different in “feelings, sentiments, habits and interests” from the District of Columbia may please the president.

Article: Trump wants to stop states from voting by mail and using voting machines toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images President Trump announced Monday on his social media site, Truth Social, that he plans to "lead a movement" to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines in the country ahead of next year's midterm elections. "We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail in ballots because they're corrupt," Trump said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Monday. It's the only way they can get elected." Sponsor Message Although Trump himself urged his supporters to vote using mail-in ballots prior to the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have been significantly more likely to vote using mail-in ballots, compared to Republicans, since the 2020 election . "Unless the president has some theory under which he could try to ban certain kinds of voting machines or tried to ban mail in ballots by enforcing some existing federal law, he would need the cooperation of Congress," Hasen said, "which I think he'd be unlikely to get to have any kind of federal interference with how the midterm elections will be run." Sponsor Message David Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the Founders deliberately gave the president no role in how elections are conducted. "Hamilton foresaw, and made clear in Federalist 59 that a democracy must diversify power of elections in order to protect itself from an overzealous executive, and therefore power over elections would reside with the several states," he told NPR in a statement. It would also be a logistical stretch to upend how states run their elections as midterm primaries get closer, said Matt Germer, director of the right-of-center R Street Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "And they need to make sure that they invest the resources in an in-person voting to maybe account for that." He said officials would have to find more locations to host polling places. "It would be a huge undertaking and I think realistically it's highly unlikely that he could end voting by mail or end the use of very particular voting machines in time for 2026 now," Germer said. Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, which advocates for wide use of mail-in voting, said it would be nearly impossible to actually get rid of mail-in voting in such a short timeframe. "This is yet another power grab of federal overreach into the states' rights to run their own election." Hasen said Trump has tried to interfere in elections before by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, so he said "it would not be surprising" if he were again trying to interfere with a major election. "And so now is the time to take preparations on the part of states and parts of courts and others to ensure that the elections that we conduct in 2026 will be conducted with fairness and integrity," Hasen said.

Article: The California state legislature passed a bill Monday that ensures homeowners, not lenders, receive at least some of the interest on insurance payouts for homes destroyed or damaged by natural disasters. California Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders. "If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks," Harabedian told CNBC. "This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild," Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced. "It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period," Harabedian said.

Article: The scenes are part of a 2-minute video Kastyukevich posted on the Telegram messaging app showing Russian officials and their local allies removing young children from the Regional Children’s Home in Kherson in late October, weeks before it was liberated by Ukrainian forces. The country accuses Moscow of abducting tens of thousands of its children and shipping them to Russia with the intent of stripping them of their national identity, a crime that Ukrainian officials call a form of genocide. Russia denies allegations of war crimes, and says it has evacuated close to 2 million civilians, including hundreds of thousands of children, from what it said were dangerous areas of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials in Kherson immediately called it a “kidnapping.” Very little is known about what happened to the children, but senior Russian officials told NBC News that they are still in Crimea. On Friday, Ukraine formally charged Kastyukevich, who shared the video of the children’s evacuation, as well as an ex-worker at the orphanage and an official in the region, accusing them of the illegal transfer and deportation of the children from the facility. In an unprecedented move against the leader of a permanent United Nations Security Council member state, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and his children’s representative, Maria Lvova-Belova, in March. Prosecutors at the Hague-based war-crimes court accused them of “unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children” from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia, including “the deportation of at least hundreds of children taken from orphanages and children’s care homes.” Moscow has dismissed accusations that it illegally deports Ukrainian children, and Russian officials have touted cases where they say they rescued children from active fighting. Lvova-Belova, who has said in multiple Telegram posts that she is now the foster parent of a child from Mariupol , a city devastated by Russia’s war, has borne the brunt of international scrutiny. (Bernat Armangue / AP file) Her social media feeds are full of videos of Russian foster families greeting Ukrainian orphans, whom she has personally delivered across the country, with balloons and toys. Lvova-Belova says she visited the children from the Kherson Regional Children’s Home in a home in Crimea shortly after they were removed from Ukraine, and promised to find their relatives. (Kremlin.ru) She did not respond to a request to visit the children in Crimea, but did tell NBC News that her office was actively looking for their relatives in Ukraine. Mykola Kuleba, CEO of Save Ukraine , a leading nongovernmental organization that helps deported Ukrainian children return home, said the organization had identified the children taken from the Kherson orphanage and is looking into the case. After the ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova — in part to prevent “further commission of crimes” — Kuleba said reuniting children with families had become even more challenging. Lyudmyla Afanasieva is a former staff member of the Kherson orphanage and cared for the children while they were in the basement of a church whose pastor had sheltered them during heavy fighting. (Chris McGrath / Getty Images file) At least three senior Ukrainian officials told NBC News they were actively working on the case: the country’s chief prosecutor, its children’s representative and the human rights ombudsman. “If we are speaking about little ones who, in a year, can forget about where they are from, what their names are … it will be very difficult to return these children, but we will fight for every one of them,” Herasymchuk said. In May, nearly 15 months after Russia’s invasion, Lvova-Belova said that Kyiv had for the first time sent concrete information on 11 children whose parents were looking for them, without providing their locations or further details. “Thousands of names” had been forwarded to his counterpart in Moscow, Tatyana Moskalkova, who works closely with Lvova-Belova, he said, although he did not provide any documents or other evidence.

The women's wing of a mental health centre run by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is the largest of only a handful of facilities in the country dedicated to helping women with mental illnesses. Thought to be in her mid-20s, she's been here for nine years, after enduring what she describes as abuse and neglect by her family, followed by a period of homelessness. Mariam has been in this facility for nine years Their stories are far from unique at the centre, where our visit, including conversations with staff and patients, is overseen by officials from the Taliban government. No-one comes to visit, and they end up living and dying here." Years of conflict has left its mark on the mental health of many Afghans, especially women, and the issue is often poorly understood and subject to stigma. In response to a recent UN report on the worsening situation of women's rights in Afghanistan, Hamdullah Fitrat, Taliban government's deputy spokesperson, told the BBC that their government did not allow any violence against women and they have "ensured women's rights in Afghanistan". But UN data released in 2024 points to a worsening mental health crisis linked to the Taliban's crackdown on women's rights: 68% of women surveyed reported having "bad" or "very bad" mental health. Many have no male relative to provide for them - 80% of my patients are young women with family issues." The Taliban government says it is committed to providing health services.

Article: With their attempts to market an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades as “Alligator Alcatraz,” Republicans have shown they’re invested in grooming Americans to accept — or even to playfully partake in — the cruelty of Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant crackdown. Ron DeSantis’ announcement of a new facility they are trying to market as “Deportation Depot.” And Home Depot evidently isn’t too keen on the use of a riff on its well-known logo on merchandise. We have reached out to the RPOF to try to resolve this issue,” a spokesperson for the company told WPLG Local 10 News in Florida, referring to the Republican Party of Florida. are parodic, artistic, and non-commercial speech protected by RPOF’s First Amendment right to engage in political speech.” Home Depot’s objection wasn’t so much a forceful statement in defense of immigrants as it was a dispute over its trademark. Much has been written about the Trump administration’s efforts to market its anti-immigrant crusade online with pop culture-infused propaganda, including white supremacist memes being promoted by the Department of Homeland Security.

Article: At the meeting among President Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other European leaders on Monday in Washington, there was frequent discussion of “security guarantees” to make sure Russia does not invade again. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has talked about assembling a force, drawn from a “coalition of the willing,” that would be stationed in Ukraine after a cease-fire or peace agreement. It would be put in place only for defensive purposes, but the idea would be to deter Russia by making the Kremlin think hard about getting into a conflict with soldiers from NATO member states. It would not be able to mount much of a defense, but the theory is that the Russians would hesitate to risk killing non-Ukrainian Europeans in any resumed invasion effort.

Article: It appears to have been rekindled, or at least stoked, by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reinforced Trump's unsubstantiated view that postal ballots "rigged" the 2020 election, at a summit Friday in Alaska. Follow live politics updates here In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Friday, Trump relayed that "one of the most interesting things" Putin told him during the summit had to do with the unreliability of mail-in voting. "They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do." He also brought it up when he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later in the day, saying, "Mail-in ballots are corrupt." But Trump faces high legal and political hurdles to changing the laws governing federal elections: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, the popularity of absentee balloting and the GOP's success in using mail-in votes in key swing states, such as Trump's home state, Florida. The Constitution vests the power for choosing the "times, places and manner" of House and Senate elections in state legislatures, with Congress and the president retaining the right to pass laws overriding them. "I don’t want to presuppose what might be in the executive order, but I think it’s pretty clear that the times, places and manners of elections are set by the state. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, “Senate Democrats will make sure that any and every measure that would make it even more difficult for Americans to vote will be dead on arrival in the Senate and will continue to fight to protect our democracy." The Republican National Committee hinted at the power of Congress in a statement Monday supporting Trump's plan. “Under his leadership and direction, the RNC is continuing to build upon our historic election integrity efforts from the successful 2024 election cycle, and we will be ready to help implement any and all changes made to our nation’s election laws by the President and Congress," RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said. "The Republican Election Integrity motto is simple: we want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” Beyond those challenges, many Republicans say Trump is fishing in a politically toxic pond that is better left alone. By contrast, in 2024, his advisers persuaded him to embrace those practices on the premise that he could "bank" votes early and not have to spend money trying to mobilize people who had already cast ballots. What is he talking about?’” Trump's White House recently hosted a group of secretaries of state to discuss "our ongoing commitment to election integrity," said Ben Kindel, a spokesperson for Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican. … Changes to Ohio's voting process require a vote of the General Assembly, so I'm sure we'll be talking with them as well." Trump's aversion to absentee ballots is perhaps most striking because Republicans' recent success in Florida elections — in Trump's home state — has coincided with the state GOP's mastery of mail-in voting. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has been a longtime proponent of early voting in the state and helped Trump see the benefit to him across swing states in 2024. But his message, that the practice is inherently corrupt, has altered the landscape in Florida, allowing Democrats to ramp up their efforts and, for the first time, take an edge in vote-by-mail ballots — even as Trump won the state in 2020 and 2024. “For years, you had to build into turnout plans the fact that the GOP would have a big advantage in vote by mail,” Steve Schale, a longtime Florida Democratic operative who was an early advocate of his party’s better using mail ballots, said in a message to NBC News. “There was a time when Republicans owned and relied on voting by mail,” said longtime Republican operative Mac Stipanovich, who helped build Florida’s vote-by-mail program but left the GOP over disagreements with Trump. Bob Martinez, said the idea of expanding vote-by-mail to make it easier for all voters to cast ballots is “anathema to the Trump Republican Party, in which voter suppression is dressed up as preventing voter fraud.” Florida Gov. “Our theory is if they had the luxury of checking a box in that general election return ballot that said, ‘Please keep my vote by mail request valid,’ then we could have continued to send them their vote-by-mail ballot for the special election.” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, a DeSantis appointee and Trump supporter, did not reply to a request for comment about Trump’s renewed push to crack down on voting by mail. We will challenge any unlawful executive order and will beat this unconstitutional attempt to disenfranchise millions of Americans." Oregon conducts its elections entirely by mail, and it was the first state to hold a presidential election by mail. If he had any inclination to actually understand or care about the American people, he'd know that mail-in voting is really the best way to protect everybody's right to vote, and that's especially true for rural folks, for elderly people and for people who work for an hourly wage." Read also pointed to the states' constitutional role in deciding how to conduct elections, adding, "I'm going to protect the rights of Oregonians and the rights of the state to choose how we elect our representatives. This is a real threat." Some Trump allies say no one should be surprised by his desire to stop mail-in balloting, as he has long decried the practice of voting in any way other than in person on Election Day.

Article: Rebels backed by ISIL (ISIS) have killed at least 52 civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this month, according to the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) in the country, as both the DRC army and Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group accuse each other of violating a recently reached US-mediated ceasefire deal. Attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) targeted the Beni and Lubero territories of the eastern North Kivu province between August 9 and 16, MONUSCO said on Monday, warning that the death toll could rise further. The renewed violence comes as a separate conflict between the DRC army and the M23 group continues to simmer in the east of the country, despite a series of peace treaties signed in recent months. The latest ADF “violence was accompanied by kidnappings, looting, the burning of houses, vehicles, and motorcycles, as well as the destruction of property belonging to populations already facing a precarious humanitarian situation,” MONUSCO said. “When they arrived, they first woke the residents, gathered them in one place, tied them up with ropes, and then began to massacre them with machetes and hoes,” Macaire Sivikunula, chief of Lubero’s Bapere sector, told the Reuters news agency over the weekend. Advertisement After a relative lull in recent months, authorities said the group killed nearly 40 people in Komanda city, Ituri province, last month, when it stormed a Catholic church during a vigil and fired on worshippers, including many women and children. The ADF, an armed group formed by former Ugandan rebels in the 1990s after discontent with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has killed thousands of civilians and increased looting and killings in the northeastern DRC. Among the 52 victims so far this month, at least nine were killed overnight from Saturday to Sunday in an attack on the town of Oicha, in North Kivu, the AFP news agency learned from security and local sources. A few days earlier, the ADF had already killed at least 40 people in several towns in the Bapere sector, also in North Kivu province, according to local and security sources.

Article: WATCH: Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration “And do you know that we’re the only country in the world — I believe, I may be wrong — but just about the only country in the world that uses (mail-in voting) because of what’s happened, massive fraud all over the place,” Trump said. 18 White House remarks that his administration is preparing an executive order “to end mail-in ballots because they’re corrupt.” We asked the White House for evidence to support Trump’s statement about other countries and received no response to that question. Data compiled by a Sweden-based organization that advocates for democracy globally found in an October 2024 report found that 34 countries or territories allow mail-in voting, which it refers to as “postal voting.” Dozens of countries allow at least some mail-in voting The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that of the 34 countries or territories, 12 allow all voters to vote by mail and in 22 permit only some voters to vote this way. All Canadians are eligible to use mail-in voting, said York University associate professor Cary Wu, who co-wrote a 2024 paper about the effect of Trump’s anti-mail voting messaging on Canadians’ views of mail voting. In the United Kingdom, on-demand postal voting in Britain was part of a wider modernization in electoral administration in the early 2000s, according to a 2021 paper by United Kingdom researchers. States set mail-in voting laws In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that “the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the president tells them. UCLA election law professor Rick Hasen wrote on his blog that Trump’s statement is “wrong and dangerous.” “The Constitution does not give the President any control over federal elections,” Hasen wrote, adding that federal courts have recognized those limits. READ MORE: Trump changes tone on mail-in ballots and other forms of early voting The Constitution’s Article 1, Section 4 says that the regulation of elections is the power of the states. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields did not address that question but said Trump wants to require voter ID and prevent “cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.” There is no evidence of widespread cheating in California and New York, two of the most populous states that consistently elect Democrats for president. Our ruling Trump said, “We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting.” Trump didn’t explain his evidence and hours later softened his language when he said he “may be wrong.” READ MORE: How election officials verify mail-in and absentee ballots In 2024, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that 34 countries or territories allow postal voting, or mail-in voting.

Article: In mid-July, the State Board of Elections began formally an effort that seeks to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s Justice Department that focused on voter registration records that lacked either a voter's driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Federal and state laws have directed that election officials request this ID information since 2004, but for about a decade the state’s registration form failed to make clear that voters were supposed to provide it if they had it. A ” Registration Repair Project” supported by the now Republican-controlled state board — flipped from a Democratic majority in the spring — created a public online database with the names of 103,270 registrants the lacking the numerical identifiers. As planned, the board is now sending letters to those who haven't already acted and offered a numerical ID, or have yet to indicate that they have neither a driver's license nor a Social Security number. It’s free,” board Executive Director Sam Hayes said, adding that taking action now will "avoid any issues the next time they show up to vote.” People on the list who don't provide the information will have to vote provisionally the next time they cast a ballot — meaning their ballots may not count in some state and local races without correct ID information. Another mailing will go out at a later date to close to 100,000 additional voters whose records also lack the identifiers but will be allowed to continue casting regular ballots because there’s evidence, for example, that they supplied a number or an alternate ID as allowed under the law.

Article: A drug dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen” has agreed to plead guilty to five federal criminal charges, including that she provided the drug that ultimately led actor Matthew Perry to suffer a fatal overdose in October 2023, federal prosecutors announced Monday. Sangha supplied the ketamine the “Friends” actor injected on the day of his death, according to the plea agreement, which also noted that she sold drugs for years out of her North Hollywood apartment, described in a federal indictment as the “Sangha stash house.” As part of a deal struck with federal prosecutors, Sangha admitted to knowingly distributing ketamine to Perry, whose struggles with drug addiction and numerous rehab visits were well documented. Perry, who had become addicted to intravenous ketamine, started purchasing the powerful drug from a Southern California doctor in late September 2023, according to the indictment and law enforcement officials. Shortly after the Los Angeles Times and TMZ published news of Perry’s death, according to the plea agreement, Sangha called Fleming on the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss how to distance themselves from it. Does K stay in your system or is it immediately flushed out[?].” Sangha, who has been in custody for the past year, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison on the drug-involved premises count, up to 10 years for each ketamine distribution count and up to 15 years for the count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury. As part of the formal guilty plea in the coming weeks, she will also admit to using her North Hollywood residence to store, package, and distribute narcotics since at least June 2019.

Article: Idaho murders: New details reveal what surviving roommate saw and heard in the house A photo posted by Kaylee Goncalves shows University of Idaho students Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Goncalves. When investigators were working to solve the University of Idaho quadruple murders, what at first appeared to be an early lead to help gauge the killer's familiarity with the victims quickly evaporated as the only surviving witness started to remember more details from that night. 13, 2022 she "was awoken and opened her room door" and "heard a male say 'it's ok Kaylee, I'm here for you,'" referring to one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves, according to newly released documents. "She has been working through it to try to remember what happened." Defense attorney Anne Taylor repeatedly questioned Mortensen's credibility as a witness, saying she "had too much to drink and couldn't remember" and "said things that were just absolutely untrue and couldn't have been true." Prosecutors pushed back, saying while versions of Mortensen's story varied, she was consistent enough, and the judge ultimately sided with prosecutors. The newly-released documents revealed that Mortensen said she heard who she thought was Goncalves walking upstairs toward her third floor room and "heard Kaylee say 'someone's here,' and she sounded frantic," according to the police interview. Mortensen "believed it was Kaylee who was walking up the stairs with [her dog] Murphy," then "heard who she believed to be Kaylee running down the stairs," the interview said. Mortensen said Murphy -- who didn't usually bark -- "was barking at this time." Four University of Idaho students were found dead at an off-campus home on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, in November 2022. "She then heard a male voice, which she stated she had never heard before, say 'It's okay, I'm going to help you.'" She said the male voice was not victim Ethan Chapin, who was asleep in his girlfriend Xana Kernodle's second-floor bedroom at the time. Kernodle -- who investigators say may have interrupted admitted killer Bryan Kohberger on the third floor -- was then attacked near her second-floor bedroom, suffering over 50 stab wounds, a police report said. "She described the suspect as not being muscular, but being skinny and toned, like a basketball player." "She looked down the hallway to Xana's bedroom and could see Xana lying on her back in her underwear, but she thought at the time Xana was passed out," according to the interview. "She said there were people coming in and out of their house all the time." Dylan Mortensen gets a hug after speaking at the sentencing hearing of Bryan Kohberger after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. Moscow police lead detective Brett Payne tracked the time, and a state police detective "walked through the residence with me calling out the number of strikes to simulate the number of wounds to each victim, based on autopsy reports," Gilbertson wrote. Gilbertson said he "conducted two timed runs, the first being a quick as possible run and the second a slower, deliberate timed run" during which he was quiet and more "methodical." Bryan Kohberger, 30, appears for his sentencing hearing after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. "The timed runs revealed that it was possible for Kohberger to have carried out the murders in as few as two minutes and six seconds, going at a fast pace on the shortest route to the vehicle, or as much as three minutes and forty-five seconds, going at a slower pace on the longer route to the vehicle," the report said. Photos of the crime scene released with the documents show a home common for college Greek life: counters littered with empty hard seltzer cans, wine bottles, snack wrappers and sticks of gum. Kaylee Goncalves/Instagram Goncalves had "jokingly mentioned she thought she had" a "stalker" after someone followed her to her car at the grocery store "a couple months" before the murders, one of the victims' neighbors said, according to the documents. The 22-year-old, who had graduated six months before the murders, described the house "as an 'open door policy,' meaning people were constantly going in and out," according to her interview with police. "Only their close friends would use the sliding glass door in the kitchen." Investigators believe Kohberger used that sliding glass door to slip into the home and fatally stab Goncalves, Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin.

Gavin Newsom that California must respond to Trump’s efforts to “rig” the 2026 midterms by working to reduced by half the number of Republicans in the state’s 52-member congressional delegation. “But with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight, and when the dust settles on election day, we will win.” Republicans accused Democrats of trying to subvert the will of the voters, who passed independent redistricting 15 years ago, for their own partisan goals. “The citizens seized back control of the power from the politicians in 2010,” said Assemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego), flanked by GOP legislators and signs in the Capitol rotunda that said, “Rigged map” and “Defend fair elections.” Advertisement “Let me be very clear,” DeMaio said. to seize back control.” After Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional districts to add five new GOP members to Congress, Newsom and California Democrats began calling to temporarily reconfigure the current congressional district boundaries, which were drawn by the voter-approved independent redistricting commission in 2021.

The measures that lawmakers will take up this week would: Give Californians the power to amend the state Constitution and approve new maps, drawn by Democrats, that would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 congressional elections, if any GOP-led states approve their own maps. “We firmly believe that they should cool it, pull back, because if they do, so will California.” Republicans responded by calling for a federal investigation into the California Democratic redistricting plan, and vowed to file multiple lawsuits in state and federal court, including two this week. “We’re going to litigate this every step of the way, but we believe that this will also be rejected at the ballot box, in the court of public opinion,” DeMaio said. He also called for a 10-year ban on holding elected office for state legislators who vote in support of calling the special election, although he did not say how he would try to do that. Advertisement McGuire dismissed the criticism and threats of legal action, saying the Republicans were more concerned about political self-preservation than the will of California voters or the rule of law.

Article: WATCH: Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration The talks, which included a second meeting with seven European and NATO leaders, took place three days after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. Since meeting with Putin, Trump has talked about reaching a peace deal saying he no longer thinks Ukraine “needs a ceasefire” and noting that there needs to be concessions on both sides. Following a social media post earlier in the day in which Trump called for getting rid of mail-in voting — a voting practice he had embraced — Trump called mail-in ballots “corrupt” and “a fraud” and promised to end mail-in voting. Trump had a hand in deals that have recently eased conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand; Israel and Iran; and India and Pakistan, although some of those countries’ leaders dispute his role. As Trump spoke about how difficult it’s been to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said that, “with all of the wars that I got involved in, we only have this one left.” But his comment notably ignores Israel’s nearly two-year war with Hamas in Gaza that started on Oct. Trump weighed in on Truth Social, saying that “we will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!” $350 billion for Ukraine doesn’t add up. A White House spokesperson told PolitiFact that Trump’s figure included direct funding to Ukraine and indirect economic costs, such as war-related inflation, rising fertilizer costs and lost trade because of sanctions on Russia. Trump’s election “joke.” After a reporter asked if Zelenskyy was open to holding an election — something Trump had criticized him for not doing — he said he would be open to it once the war is over.

Article: Although the term “neoconservative” has fallen into disuse — except as an occasional slur used by the MAGA right, the progressive left and social-media antisemites who really mean to say “Jew” — I’ve never been shy about describing myself as one. Neoconservatism emerged in the early 1970s as a loosely coherent movement of disenchanted liberals who were critical of the welfare state and turned off by the anti-Americanism of parts of the antiwar left. But the movement also took a dim view of the Nixon administration, particularly in its pursuit of arms control with the Soviet Union, its relative indifference to human rights issues behind the Iron Curtain, and its realpolitik approach to foreign policy in general. I learned this the hard way 14 years ago, when Henry Kissinger nearly kicked me out of his Park Avenue office for having the ill grace to ask him about China’s brutal treatment of Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned dissident. Like President Richard Nixon’s, Trump’s politics are a mix of statist economic impulses, populist grievances, the conceit of being above the law and a transactional approach to foreign policy that discounts the moral force of American ideals.

Article: His extraordinary effort to take over law enforcement in Washington, D.C., which is ramping up as it enters its second week, helps nudge the political discourse toward what he has long seen as more favorable terrain: A fight with Democrats over crime. (And they are determined not to take the bait.) It wasn’t so long ago that Trump was praising the nationwide drop in the murder rate — or even that one of his own officials in Washington was specifically touting the drop in violent crime there. By deploying National Guard troops to patrol the streets and seeking control of the local police, his opponents say, Trump is transparently stoking fear for political gain, and exaggerating statistics to justify a power grab. Republicans seized on the pandemic crime spike to win control of the House in 2022 and to help expand Trump’s coalition in 2024, even though rates of violent crime had, by then, begun to recede.

It was the Brazilian's first Premier League double since scoring two against former side Everton in February 2024, while he's the first Spurs player to score two on opening day since Harry Kane in 2019-20 - a season Kane ended with 18 Premier League goals. Just eight more doubles to go… Tijjani Reijnders It was an incredibly impressive debut for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, who became the first player to score and assist on his Premier League debut while playing for Manchester City since Sergio Aguero in August 2011. Only Erling Haaland had both more shots and more touches in the opposition box against Wolves than Reijnders (3 shots, 5 touches in box), while only Nico Gonzalez made more successful final third passes than the Dutchman (20). Virgil van Dijk Reigning champions Liverpool got their season off to a winning start against Bournemouth and - in a game they scored four goals - their standout player was captain Virgil van Dijk.

Article: "We are demanding that this administration do what they say they're going to do if they're not going to close the camps," Marisa Limon Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, told El Paso ABC affiliate KVIA. "At a minimum, we need access to people who have due process and should have access to attorneys." The criticism came as a federal judge on Monday heard arguments from lawyers for detainees at the Florida detention center known as "Alligator Alcatraz," who say they lack proper attorney access and are being held without any formal criminal or immigration charges against them. Veronica Escobar, who toured the new Texas detention center Monday, said of the facility's price tag, "I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans." "There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration," she said. They have no legal right to be here." "Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens," Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday. "The One Big Beautiful Bill has provided historic funding to help us carry out this mandate, especially by securing enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds." "The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals," McLaughlin said.

"Our entire city stands with them and is here to support them." Islam, 36, was working in the lobby of the 44-story building on Park Avenue in New York City on July 28 when, police say, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas walked in and immediately opened fire using a semiautomatic rifle. Tisch said afterward that Islam was working in the lobby of the building with the department's permission under a program that allows officers to provide security off-duty but in uniform. After the attack Adams said that those who knew the officer said he “believed in living out the life of a godly person.” Tamura also shot a security guard and two civilians in the building before fatally shooting himself, authorities said. Adams said Tamura, who completed a cross-country drive just prior to the attack, was trying to target the headquarters of the NFL, which has offices in the Park Avenue building, but entered the wrong set of elevator banks and never made it to the league's offices. Two officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the shooter, who played football in high school in Southern California, left a note at the scene that said he wanted his brain studied for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said after the attack: “He went out every single day to provide for his family, whether it was overtime or whatever he had to do." Tisch said in her statement Monday that the newborn, his mother and his brothers are part of the NYPD fabric.

Article: Geoff Bennett: Leaders from across Europe descended on Washington today in a remarkable show of support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who came to the White House to meet President Trump. Nick Schifrin: In a deal outlined today, Ukraine’s ability to guarantee its security will rely on European troops sent into Ukraine, as well as European weapons and Europe’s purchasing American weapons to be dispatched to Ukraine. Nick Schifrin: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got by with more than a little help from those friends today, the largest ever gathering of Europeans in Washington outside a NATO summit. Vladimir Putin, Russian President (through translator): We’re convinced, in order to make the settlement extremely lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict. Nick Schifrin: Of course, the European officials who are still meeting with President Trump in the White House behind me believe that the root cause of the war is Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tonight, Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide has confirmed that President Trump called Vladimir Putin in a call that was described as — quote — “frank and constructive.” A senior Ukrainian official participating in the meetings tonight tells me that the Oval Office meeting was — quote — “very good” and the whole day has gone — quote — “more than good,” indicating, Geoff, that at least the Ukrainians, or from their perspective, they have achieved what they sought to achieve today. But they had European unity on their side, including many European leaders whom President Trump has grown quite fond of, and they had momentum already on a key point, security guarantees. officials tell me that Zelenskyy wasn’t expected to say yes tonight, but they expected him not to say no, and to go back to Kyiv and perhaps present a counteroffer. Nick Schifrin: According to Russian media, just out in the last few minutes, they did discuss that trilateral meeting that President Trump has promised and that President Zelenskyy, you heard in the White House today, endorse. They argue that that summit moved the ball along, allowed this meeting today, allowed the phone call between President Trump and President Putin tonight, and that at that summit Putin agreed that these security guarantees could be offered by the United States to Ukraine. And Europe wants to keep pressure on Russia, and, as you heard Rubio and others, senior officials, saying they will not impose more sanctions while these negotiations continue — Geoff.

Article: McALLEN, Texas -- A federal judge ruled Friday to deny the Trump administration's request to end a policy in place for nearly three decades that is meant to protect immigrant children in federal custody. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone," Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement. In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.” Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.

Citing a need to protect prospects from harassment, many sororities have made similar moves, issuing a de facto ban against talking to the press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, where almost 13,000 students participate in the nation's largest on-campus Greek life. Meanwhile, online attention to rush has led to books, a polarizing documentary and the reality television series, widening the appeal of sororities in the South in particular, according to Lorie Stefaneli, a New York City-based consultant who flies to Tuscaloosa each year for rush. Rush can be fun and help girls build confidence, but it's also an “emotional rollercoaster,” especially for girls who feel they need to reveal themselves to a massive audience, Stefaneli said. “It kind of gets in the way of sisterhood.” Some incoming freshmen — including Darnell's 19-year-old sister Izzy, with a vast social media following of her own — have chosen to post anyway, satisfying a demand that can reach millions of views within days.

(Chris Granger/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP, File) NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard. Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as “personal and intimate.” The first female mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment: The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working. Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.” Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail “due to COVID,” saying her travel accommodations were “a matter of safety, not of luxury.” The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha’s Vineyard. The pair used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” he said. She is also among more than 100 people brought up on corruption charges in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans two decades ago, said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a watchdog group that provided photographs and information to federal authorities in the latest case.

Article: Ziva Mann has been navigating the challenges of raising a transgender child within an Orthodox Jewish community Ziva Mann, mother of a transgender child and member of a welcoming synagogue, poses in her garden, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Ziva Mann remembers how joyful and smiley her daughter was as a child — the family even gave her the nickname “Giggles.” “She was just sunshine,” Mann said. So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.” She said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. “Without Eshel, I don’t know how this would have turned out for any of us.” Mann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family. “Because a life is more important than all of the rules.” Respecting her daughter’s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn’t feel the need to talk to God about it. “The strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who’s walking a difficult path.” Mann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. “He’s probably my child that has the strongest commitment to Judaism from an emotional connection." A rabbi told Paneth that Ollie is welcome to come to services, but he would now be expected to sit among the men. “If I was going to survive this, I had to come out with my parents as trans and start medically transitioning.” He had top surgery in 2022 and soon after met his girlfriend at JQY, a program for Jewish LGBTQ+ teens. “Even though I look different, my relationship to God didn’t change.” Kabakov said many LGBTQ+ Jews eventually decide to leave Orthodoxy, but for those who wish to remain, Eshel and some spiritual leaders offer support. Rabbi Mike Moskowitz, who works at an LGBTQ+ synagogue in New York, thinks of his job as helping people understand how they can be their authentic selves and still feel accepted by their religion. “Orthodoxy, the people, are the problem.” The counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. “Unity is coping through kindness and being able to replace the weight of oppression with the elevation of love.” ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The red carpet treatment, the lack of concrete decisions for Ukraine and, most significantly, neglecting the significance of sanctions — a policy that could turn the tide in Kyiv’s favor — have felt like a betrayal for Ukrainians who have borne enormous suffering in the almost three-and-a-half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian servicemen, the country’s bravest and most skilled, have been killed and wounded, thousands of civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, and a fifth of the country is under occupation, severing families, properties and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time in a decade that Putin had stepped foot in the U.S., ending international isolation spurred by the 2022 Ukraine invasion; in other words, it was a win.

Article: KINSHASA, Congo -- Suspected Islamist rebels have killed at least 30 people in a series of attacks in Congo's North Kivu province in recent days, a Congolese military official said Saturday. The attacks are the latest in a string of recent attacks by Islamic State-aligned Allied Democratic Force (ADF) after its members killed nearly 40 people last month in an attack on a Catholic church in Ituri. The incidence of ADF attacks adds to the complicated security challenges in the eastern region of Congo, where dozens of other armed groups are fighting, and the central government is battling the M23 rebels, which have taken control of Goma and other key cities.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) BELGRADE, Serbia -- Angry protesters clashed with police in a town in western Serbia and in the capital Belgrade on Saturday as tensions soared further in the Balkan nation following days of violent demonstrations. Wearing scarves over their faces and chanting slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic, a group of young men threw flares at his Serbian Progressive Party offices in Valjevo, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital Belgrade. Similar clashes also erupted on Saturday evening in the northern city of Novi Sad and in Belgrade, with police directing tear gas at protesters while battling the protesters who set garbage containers on fire. The protest in Valjevo drew several thousand people after a video on social media showed a young man from the town being severely beaten by police who kicked him and bashed him with batons during a protest earlier this week. Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, has called for “calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly” “Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards,” he said on X this week.

The Jet Centre, which provides ground handling for flights, said late Friday that it suffered a data security incident which led to “unauthorised access to a limited number of company emails." About 3,700 individuals are thought to be potentially affected by the incident, including Afghans who were brought to the U.K. In a previous incident, some Afghans who fought alongside British forces before the Taliban swept back to power had their data leaked after an official released the details of 18,714 individuals “in error” in February 2022.

Article: Pope Leo XIV is marking his first 100 days in office, showing a mix of continuity with and change from Pope Francis' papacy VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the “salt of the Earth, the light of the world.” He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go. As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. “Even those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn’t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,” Hughes said. Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis’ pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City’s needs and turn it into the world’s first carbon-neutral state. He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century’s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a “doctor” of the church. Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself. Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo’s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month. Peter's a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there. Given Francis’ stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church's mission today: He said the church was "called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.” Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo. “He is the incarnation of the ‘unity of difference,’ because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,” said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese. “And I, as prior general, said ‘I understand, Your Eminence, but he’s got to do something else’ and so I transferred him somewhere else,” Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.

Article: Nigeria's national security adviser has announced the arrest of two militant leaders on the country's most wanted list Nigeria says it has arrested 2 militant leaders on its most wanted list LAGOS, Nigeria -- The leaders of two militant groups on Nigeria 's most wanted list have been arrested in an operation involving multiple agencies, the West African country's national security adviser said Saturday. Officials said the arrests came in an operation conducted between May and July and that they recovered valuable materials including digital evidence that is undergoing forensic analysis and could lead to more arrests. He said the arrested leaders are responsible for the Kuje prison attack in 2022 that led to the escape of dozens of jailed Boko Haram members and an attack on the Niger uranium facility in 2013, among others. Ribadu said they maintain “active links with terrorist groups across the Maghreb, particularly in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.” Nigeria faces a complex, multidimensional security challenge with various armed groups operating across the country. Oluwole Ojewale, a Dakar-based security analyst at the Institute of Security Studies, says the significant arrest will test the resilience of Ansaru and its capacity to spring surprises or mount major attacks in the immediate term.

Article: Of the 92% S & P 500 companies that have reported, 60% have beaten consensus earnings per share forecasts by more than a standard deviation of analyst estimates, according to data from the firm. "With the 2Q 2025 earnings season nearly complete, the quarter has been marked by one of the greatest frequency of earnings beats on record," wrote David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. He also said that profit margins for the S & P 500 have been "more resilient to tariffs than investors feared." "While we expect companies will generally be able to mitigate tariff costs and maintain their profit margins, the magnitude of margin expansion embedded in consensus estimates appears unrealistic," he continued. "We expect the strong recent trajectory of analyst earnings revisions to weaken going forward, but no more than the average downward trend of the last few decades." This might be a double-edged sword, however, as this strong season has led to a ratcheting up of earnings per share forecasts for the future. To be sure, Kostin said that analysts still foresee a deceleration in S & P 500 earnings per share growth in the months ahead, dropping to 7% in the second half from 11% in the second quarter.

Article: Entire church to be transported across Swedish city 3 hours ago Share Save Erika Benke BBC News, Kiruna Share Save Reuters The relocation of the church will take place over two days A landmark 113-year-old church at risk from ground subsidence is about to be relocated in its entirety - in a 5km (3 miles) move along a road in Sweden's far north. These include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts. People have to move before the infrastructure fails." The iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; £737m). "We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lampposts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway." Among the most delicate aspects of the move is the protection of the church's interior treasures, especially its great altar painting made by Prince Eugen, a member of Sweden's royal family. So will the organ with its 1,000 pipes." Reuters The church has been hoisted on wheeled transportation unit LKAB Interior parts of the church have been secured by metal scaffolding The move is much more than an engineering marvel for local residents - it's a deeply emotional moment. "The church has served as a spiritual centre and a gathering place for the community for generations," says Sofia Lagerlöf Määttä, who remembers walking into the church for the first time as a young child with her grandmother. "The move has brought back memories of joy and sorrow to us, and we're now moving those memories with us into the future." That feeling is also shared by project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, an engineer who doubles as a member of the church's gospel choir.

Article: How long tubes of mud could reveal how Antarctica is changing 3 hours ago Share Save Victoria Gill, Kate Stephens and Gwyndaf Hughes BBC News Science team Share Save Elisenda Balleste The researchers worked from a vessel at a number of locations around the Antarctic Peninsula Why would anyone brave hand-numbing cold, icy winds and rough seas - sometimes working through the night - to dig up mud from the Antarctic seabed? That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling - affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. "Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time," she said. Elisenda Balleste Scientists carefully slice the sediment cores in a lab on board the ship The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes.

Article: Why India tops the list of abandoned sailors 41 minutes ago Share Save Neyaz Farooquee BBC News, Delhi Share Save BBC An Indian crew member of Anka cargo vessel, which is abandoned at an Ukrainian port since April Manas Kumar* has been abandoned on a cargo ship in Ukrainian waters since April. The Indian seaman was part of a crew of 14 transporting popcorn to Turkey from Moldova when the vessel was raided on 18 April, as it made its way down the Danube river which divides Ukraine and Romania. But exactly who owns the ship is not clear from the papers provided by the crew, made up of Mr Kumar, five other Indian nationals, as well as two Azerbaijanis and six Egyptians. The problem is disembarking means the crew losing their salaries - amounting to $102,828 by June all together, according to a joint database of abandoned ships maintained by International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). But it also tops the list of crew members known as "abandoned seafarers" - a term used by 2006 Maritime Labour Convention to describe the situation when shipowners sever ties with the crew and fail to provide them for repatriation, regular provisions and wages. According to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers globally, there were 3,133 abandoned sailors across 312 ships in 2024 - of which Indian nationals accounted for 899. For many, leaving the ship without a salary is not possible - especially if they have already paid hefty sums to agents for landing the job or for acquiring training certifications, Mohammad Gulam Ansari, a former seafarer who helps repatriate Indian crew from other parts of the world, tells the BBC. Crew members of Nirvana vessel cooking food on the ship The most significant reason for abandonment is the widespread practice of registering ships - called flags of convenience - in countries that have weak shipping rules, according to ITF. "A country can set up a ship registry and charge fees to shipowners, while having reduced standards for crew safety and welfare and often failing to live up to the responsibilities of a genuine flag state," the ITF website states. BBC/ITF Crew members of Nirvana vessel were repatriated after months at the sea but continue to wait for their salaries Seafarers often blame India's maritime regulator, Directorate General (DG) of Shipping - which is tasked with verifying the credentials of ships, their owners and recruitment and placement agencies - for lax scrutiny of stakeholders. "When you are hired, you get enough time to inform the DG Shipping [about any discrepancies in your contract]," said Sushil Deorukhkar, an ITF representative working for the welfare of the seafarers. "Once you sign the papers, you are stuck and have to knock on every door for resolution." Things can get complicated even for the crew on Indian-owned ships operating within the country's waters for a variety of reasons. In early April, Mr Singh was taking it to a port in western India's Gujarat state for dismantling when an Indian court ordered its seizure "for non-payment of crew", according to the ILO-IMO database.

Article: toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR "Everybody looks and waits for this first weekend [of August] to come to Langford," says Richard Love, one of the officials at the 79th annual competition this year. "It's grassroots, it's motorsports — this place is unbelievable." Tractor pulling was created in the 1920s by farmers wanting to show off their machines and have something to look forward to, says Love. This event in Langford has been held annually since 1946, even hosting limited runs during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain its position as the longest-running event of its kind in the country. Sponsor Message Rules of the Road In the competition, tractors and trucks latch onto a contraption called a sled, which looks like a flat-bed trailer carrying a huge weighted box on a slider. Horsepower meets tradition "The crowd is just electric here – I mean, these people come to see tractor and truck pulling and they just love it here," says Kelly Giltinan, the driver behind the wheel of a red pulling truck called "Bull Headed," fit with a 1955 chassis and a chrome-plated modern engine. Sponsor Message Giltinan, who came from Pennsylvania, says that driving in a pull is a bit different from driving on the road because his truck only runs in one gear, and its engine is specially designed to produce as much power as possible in as little time as possible. "I mean, this horsepower you can feel in your chest." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Giltinan's trip to Langford didn't go as he'd hoped — the pulling sled heavily damaged the back of his truck on his first attempt, which prevented him from making any more runs at Langford. "It's in your blood, you just love making horsepower." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Like NASCAR, but for tractors and trucks While drivers like Giltinan get all the glory, each competitor typically has a whole team of people supporting them behind the scenes. "The team behind building them is just as important as a driver," Meals explained, "If you don't have a good driver, you can have the biggest motor you want, but it's still going to fall short." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR One local, 20-year-old Matt Sweet, said that he's been coming every year since he was born, and his father has been attending since 1975. Sponsor Message "The little kids love it – they run down the side of the track, chasing the tractors and in the pits, [and] the drivers will let them sit in the seats," says Sweet, reminded of when he was in those kid's position, "it's very nostalgic, seeing that, I just really get a full circle moment."

Article: North Korea has long denounced the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program. While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies’ joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency said. “The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The government of South Korea’s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who has expressed a willingness to repair ties and resume dialogue with the North, did not immediately respond to Kim’s comments. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks. Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship’s weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy’s modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front line military activities and propaganda campaigns.

Article: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has agreed to provide to Congress documents from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, a key House lawmaker said Monday in announcing a move that appears to avert, at least temporarily, a potential separation of powers clash. The records are to be turned over starting Friday to the House Oversight Committee, which earlier this month issued a broad subpoena to the Justice Department about a criminal case that has long captivated public attention, recently roiled the top rungs of President Donald Trump's administration and been a consistent magnet for conspiracy theories. “There are many records in DOJ’s custody, and it will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,” Kentucky Rep. It also demanded records about communications between Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein, as well as documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement. It was not clear exactly which or how many documents might be produced or whether the cooperation with Congress reflected a broader change in posture since last month, when the FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing any additional records from the Epstein investigation after determining that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted." That announcement put the Trump administration on the defensive, with officials since then scrambling both to tamp down angry questions from the president's base and also laboring to appear transparent. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell at a Florida courthouse over two days last month — though no records from those conversations have been made public — and the Justice Department has also sought to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases, though so far those requests have been denied.

Article: Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Monday against a ticket broker, alleging the company used illegal tactics to exceed purchasing limits for popular events and then resold tickets at significantly higher prices. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, the FTC said Maryland-based ticket broker Key Investment Group has used thousands of fictitious Ticketmaster accounts and other methods to buy tickets for events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. According to the FTC, Key Investment Group – which does business under brand names like Epic Seats and Totally Tix – purchased at least 379,776 tickets from Ticketmaster between Nov. For just one Taylor Swift concert, Key Investment Group allegedly used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets, dramatically exceeding the Eras Tour’s 2023 six-ticket purchase limit per event, the FTC said. Key Investment Group said the FTC is misapplying the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, a 2016 law which it said was meant to target malicious software, not legitimate resale businesses. Key Investment Group sued the FTC in July to try to prevent the agency from using the law against it, saying it uses human employees — not bots — to buy tickets. The order also directed the FTC to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process” and to “take enforcement action to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary ticketing market."

Article: TORONTO, ON — The union for 10,000 striking Air Canada flight attendants said Monday they won’t return to work even though the strike, now in its third day, has been declared illegal. The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labor laws, had said the union needed to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties. Our members want a solution here, but solution has to be found at the bargaining table.” It was not immediately clear what recourse the board or the government have if the union continues to refuse. Labor leaders are objecting to the Canadian government’s repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere. “I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.” Carney said it was disappointing that the talks have not led to a deal, and he stressed it was important that flight attendants are compensated fairly at all times. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout. “We’re obviously hoping we can go tomorrow, but we’ll make that decision later today,” Rousseau said on BNN Bloomberg shortly after the union announced it would continue with the strike. Disrupted tourists, stranded passengers Montreal resident Robert Brzymowski has been stranded in Prague along with his wife and their two children since Saturday, when Air Canada canceled their flight home from what was meant to be a two-week vacation visiting relatives. Brzymowski, who consults businesses on energy-efficient practices, said he was set to start a new job Monday but lost out on the contract because he wasn’t back in Montreal in time. The worst thing is the amount of anxiety it’s caused.” Frustrated by what he described as a lack of communication from the airline, Brzymowski said he went to the airport in Prague on Monday morning in search of answers. Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

At his opening appearance in the Oval Office, Zelensky spoke little - or maybe he was not keen to, fearing that what he had to say was different from what Trump wanted to hear. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron both said a ceasefire in Ukraine should be the next step, even though Trump had argued that it was not necessary before a more permanent solution is found. Getty Images What we heard from the leaders suggests that their discussions behind closed doors focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and prospects for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin. At an earlier news conference outside the White House, he said security guarantees could include a $90bn (£67bn) deal between Kyiv and Washington to acquire US weapons, including aviation systems, anti-missile systems and other weapons he declined to disclose. The Ukranian leader, however, was more willing to talk about his possible meeting with Putin, telling reporters he was ready to meet directly with his Russian counterpart, and if Moscow agreed, Trump could join the negotiations.

Lawyers for Boyd filed a federal lawsuit in July — about a month after the state began asking for his execution date — seeking to prevent the state from executing him with nitrogen. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser who witnessed the first nitrogen execution and is now working with Boyd, said Monday that he was “horrified” by what he saw at that execution, which he described as being “suffocated to death.” The Alabama attorney general’s office has urged a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that there is “substantial evidence that nitrogen hypoxia is a painless way to die.” The state argued the described movements in previous executions were either inmates actively resisting or “involuntary movements associated with dying.” Huguley’s burned body was found Aug.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to convene a face-to-face summit between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest bid to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s proposal on Monday came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict, which has raged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said he had “begun arrangements” for the summit after speaking with Putin by phone, and that he would hold a trilateral meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts following their two-way meeting. “Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location. Moscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia’s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump “spoke in favour of continuing direct talks” between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Advertisement The proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow’s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House. Asked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the “first line of defence”, but that Washington would provide “a lot of help”. While Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance’s collective defence mandate. Speaking on Fox News after Monday’s talks, Rutte called Washington’s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security a “breakthrough”, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days. “What we all agree on is that if this war does come to end… it has to be definitive – that Russia will never, ever, ever again try to get a catch a square mile of territory of Ukraine post a peace deal,” Rutte said. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground. “This is all ‘unacceptable’ to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,” Sonin told Al Jazeera. “Russia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders – including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 – and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,” Sonin said. And that’s been true in every war.” Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to Moscow, said on Monday that land would be an issue for him and Putin to work out between them.

Article: There must be a push for peace to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, but French President Emmanuel Macron is skeptical that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to resolve the conflict. “When I look at the situation and the facts, I don’t see President Putin very willing to get peace now,” Macron told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview Monday after a high-stakes White House meeting Monday. So if he considers he can get a deal done, this is great news, and we have to do whatever we can to have a great deal.” Macron insisted that the United States must apply pressure to Russia and Putin to find a resolution, including introducing more sanctions. If there is no progress in the bilateral meeting President Donald Trump announced between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and if a trilateral meeting falls through, “or if the Russians don’t comply with this approach, yes, we have to increase the sanctions, secondary and primary sanctions,” Macron said. There is a country which decided to kill people, stole children and who refused a ceasefire and peace, so we cannot just create an equivalent situation between Ukraine and Russia.” Ukraine must be given security guarantees to prevent any future Russian attacks that could prolong the conflict or start a new war, Macron said after his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and top European leaders. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, “I do hope,” noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States. Putin kept up the pressure in the lead-up to the talks with deadly attacks in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia overnight, seemingly trying to push Zelenskyy to meet what are thought to be sweeping demands for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Macron said there should not be any land swapping, as Trump has suggested, particularly because there have been long periods during the Russian-started war that its military was not able make significant gains in taking control of Ukrainian land. “What’s happening in Ukraine is extremely important for Ukrainian people, obviously, but for the whole security of Europe, because we speak about containing a nuclear power, which decided just not to respect international borders anymore.

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable seen in a video pulling a gun following a family dispute remains under investigation as her attorney says the public is only seeing part of the story. Brown, who was in uniform at the time but off duty, according to Precinct 1, is seen pointing a firearm at the man while demanding the return of her sister's phone. The man recording the incident told ABC13 that he had taken the phone during an argument with the mother of his child, Brown's sister, and was later confronted by Brown herself, who allegedly chased him down in her personal vehicle. "At that time, she believed her sister had been assaulted and kidnapped by the perpetrator." According to Bolin, Brown first called Harris County Precinct 4 for help to respond to her sister's address but then saw her phone in motion via a tracking app and feared she had been taken against her will. When she realized her sister wasn't in that vehicle, she took the phone that was her sister's and continued to check on her well-being." The one-minute video does not include any mention of Brown's concern for her sister's whereabouts. Prior to that, she was employed by the Lone Star College Police Department, where records obtained by ABC13 through an open records request, show she had been disciplined for conduct violations, including the use of profanity.

Article: Nicole Collier must remain on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives after declining to sign a document Monday that would assign her a law enforcement escort to monitor her movements across the state, according to a news release. Earlier this month, dozens of House Democrats left the state, many to Chicago, to prevent a quorum and stall a special legislative session focused on redrawing the state’s congressional maps. Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and former chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus who represents a majority-minority district, said she will not submit to what she described as intimidation tactics. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement. "When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” Democratic colleagues have voiced support for Collier’s decision and called on House leadership to restore public access to the chamber galleries, which were closed during the standoff.

Article: The rebrand, announced yesterday, aims to create distance between the liberal news network—home to Rachel Maddow, Ari Melber, and Nicole Wallace—and NBC Universal, which owns NBC, amid an ongoing corporate divorce. The name change comes as part of the process that started last November of spinning off MSNBC and other NBCU cable network properties, including the Golf Channel, E!, and CNBC, into a new company called Versant. MSNBC, which got its original name from a now-defunct partnership between NBC and Microsoft, has been on a quest to forge an independent identity as its opinion journalism with a progressive slant has created headaches for NBC, which has maintained a more neutral editorial tone. Not just a name change Like an adult in their early 20s finally moving from their parents’ house, MSNBC is in the process of becoming operationally self-sufficient as it separates from its corporate cousin, NBC. The two networks are moving away from sharing on-air talent, and MSNBC has been on a hiring spree to beef up its newsgathering prowess so it doesn’t have to rely on NBC for scoops. Aside from new-hire editors and producers, it recently brought on several NBC News personalities, including correspondents Jacob Soboroff and Vaughn Hillyard, as well as political reporters from Politico and the Washington Post. Big picture: Though MSNBC does well in the nightly eyeballs game—surpassing CNN to receive the second-highest primetime ratings among cable news channels—it lags behind Fox News, which had more than double the primetime viewers last quarter, according to Nielsen Live+SD data.—SK

(AP Photo/Adlai Coleman) Michael Deng Dut, 29 years-old, who says he was electrocuted more than 18 times after his arrest by the Sudanese Armed Forces, poses for a photo during an interview with The Associated Press in Renk, South Sudan, Thursday, Aug 7, 2025. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, “I am alive.” After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle. Sudan — once his place of refuge — has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to UN agencies. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people “without charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities” in “a widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.” Abdullah can attest to this. “Even when you shouted to them,” said Abdullah, “they would tell you, ‘if you want to die also, you can die with them.’” The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah State and Khartoum. One man, Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been “tortured with electricity more than 18 times.” Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm. “This is the reason many of us passed away,” said Tong, “because of the lack of food and water.” In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the UN’s International Office of Migration. “All of us, together.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

"This is a waste of taxpayer dollars and really performative theater.” Collier, who represents a minority-majority district, said she would not “sign away my dignity" and allow Republicans to “control my movements and monitor me.” “I know these maps will harm my constituents,” she said in a statement. "I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” The tit-for-tat puts the nation's two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We don’t want this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight,” said Democrat Marc Berman, a California Assembly member who previously chaired the elections committee. Greg Abbott launched the expanding battle when he heeded Trump's wishes and added redistricting to an initial special session agenda that included multiple issues, including a package responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98 WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said. Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. “Politics Today” began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001. Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book “85 Days.” Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as “friendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains” who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse’s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, “Boys on the Bus.” When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, “we often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it “the most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.” But he did not blame that view for The Sun’s dropping his column. “The war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,” he wrote for the Poynter Institute’s blog. Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training.

Article: Nkrumah was opposed and derided by some fellow African leaders for what they saw as his unrealistic dream of merging dozens of newly formed countries to form a continental government, perhaps with him at the helm. The Ghanaian leader saw this move toward larger units, both economically and politically, as a matter of successive voluntary steps — with states joining to integrate their markets and road and rail networks, then perhaps merging at the subregional level before any eventual attempt to form a nation that would encompass, say, all of West, East or Southern Africa. This was the future he saw for his continent, as he explained to his peers at the founding summit of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1963.

Article: Alex Livesey | Getty Images European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie. You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts." According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. Private equity More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research. But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is "starting to crack down on clubs." This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an "injustice" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions. The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income "plateauing" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights. That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches. Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games "will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli." The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is "very different" from American peers when it comes to international games.

Article: adults in professional jobs found that 91% of Gen Z said it would be nice to have a balance of virtual and in-person events to connect with others at their company and in their industry. "In general, young people seek the social atmosphere because many of them just graduated college or are a few years out and are looking for similar social conveniences," Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, explained. Canary Wharf, London's privately owned financial district, which houses companies like JPMorgan, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, launched the Wharf Connect networking program in 2024 for professionals in the first 10 years of their career. "Part of the return-to-office push is that young people, especially, yearn for those connections, and relative to older generations, they are much more isolated and lonely, so return to office at least partially allows them to meet their coworkers," Schawbel said. Last week, I took a trip to Canary Wharf to attend a Xiao Long Bao (dumpling) masterclass at Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung — an event organized by Wharf Connect. Walking into a dining room nestled at the back of the restaurant where the workshop was taking place, I was stunned to see how busy it was with over 50 young professionals in attendance and chattering away. Before starting his job in the Canary Wharf area, he was already seeking out social events or communities that would allow him to socialize and mingle outside of the workplace, but they left much to be desired. "So I go into the office as many times a week as I can…working from home after Covid has been a bit s--- like I'll go into the office three or four times a week and most of my team won't be in," Haria said.

Article: Jenny Southan, CEO of travel trend forecasting agency Globetrender, described the summer of 2025 as "a turning point for European tourism, underscoring that no destination is truly immune to climate volatility." Extreme heat is made much more likely by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels. Miguel Riopa | Afp | Getty Images Heatwaves and wildfires across popular vacation destinations in Spain, Portugal and Greece have taken their toll on local infrastructure in recent weeks, triggering mass evacuations and shuttering beaches. Alarmingly high temperatures have also been recorded in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, posing a direct challenge to the notion that northern Europe "offers guaranteed relief" in peak summer, Southan told CNBC by email. "This double blow has accelerated a behavioural shift already in motion: travellers are avoiding the most intense heat periods, favouring cooler coastal or alpine locations, moving trips to spring and autumn, and experimenting with higher-latitude destinations from the Baltics to the Scottish Highlands," Southan said. The ETC found that heightened concern about overcrowding had prompted tourists to spend their 2025 summer vacations in less popular or off-the-beaten track destinations, while interest in traditional hotspots has declined. "Our latest data shows that, even amid shifting economic and social realities, Europeans are not willing to compromise on travel, and they increasingly prefer quieter destinations and trips outside peak seasons," ETC President Miguel Sanz said in a statement.

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images Another one of the winners to emerge from the coolcations trend has been the small central European country of Slovenia, which has received growing interest in higher altitude, cooler destinations. Southern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively. Linda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. "Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand – Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites," Jonczyk told CNBC by email.
