Article: Trump and Putin to meet in Alaska for Ukraine talks next week 38 minutes ago Share Save Courtney Subramanian BBC News, at the White House Ali Abbas Ahmadi BBC News Share Save Getty Images Trump said on Friday he expected "some swapping of territories" between Russia and Ukraine US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Alaska next Friday to discuss the future of the war in Ukraine. Trump announced the 15 August meeting on social media and it was later confirmed by a Kremlin spokesperson, who said the location was "quite logical" given Alaska's relative proximity to Russia. The announcement of the meeting came just hours after Trump signalled Ukraine might have to cede territory in order to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. However, the BBC's US partner CBS News, citing sources familiar with the discussions, reports that the White House is trying to sway European leaders to accept an agreement that would include Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and keeping Crimea. Three rounds of direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul have failed to bring the war closer to an end, and Moscow's military and political preconditions for peace are seen by Kyiv and its allies as the de facto capitulation of Ukraine. "President Zelensky has to get all of his, everything he needs, because he's going to have to get ready to sign something and I think he's working hard to get that done," Trump said.

Article: Israel rejects international criticism of Gaza City takeover plan 6 hours ago Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Reuters Benjamin Netanyahu's office says a newly adopted five-point plan is aimed "defeating Hamas" and "concluding the war" Israel has strongly rejected criticism from world leaders after its security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City. Israel's decision to expand its war in Gaza sparked condemnation from the UN and several countries including the UK, France and Canada, and prompted Germany to halt military exports to Israel. The plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet, lists five "principles" for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing "an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority". On Friday, foreign ministers from the UK, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Australia released a joint statement rejecting the plan, saying it would "aggravate" the already "catastrophic" situation in Gaza. In other reaction: UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move "wrong", saying it would "only bring more bloodshed" Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Israel "not to go down this path", saying it would "only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza" Turkey's foreign ministry urged the world community to prevent Israel's plan which aimed to "forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land" In China, a foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP news agency: "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory". Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins The IDF currently controls about three-quarters of Gaza, and almost all of its 2.1 million citizens are situated in the quarter of the territory that the military does not control.

Article: Israel's Gaza City plan means more misery for Palestinians and big risk for Netanyahu About one million people still live in Gaza City, which has already seen widespread damage due to Israeli bombardment News of the Israeli government's decision to take over Gaza City is being met not surprisingly with despair in Gaza. Assuming that Hamas does not capitulate in the coming weeks – and there are currently few signs of this happening – then the Israeli military is set to embark on a devastating new phase of the war. Hundreds of thousands are people who were forced to flee during the early months of the war but who returned in January when a ceasefire raised hopes of an end to the fighting. But life in the city, hard enough already, deteriorated rapidly after Israel broke the ceasefire in mid-March and cut off aid supplies, triggering the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict.

Article: 'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests 3 hours ago Share Save Tom Symonds Correspondent, BBC News Share Save Carl Court/Getty Images "We are not happy with these men in this hotel because we fear for our children," Orla Minihane tells me. "If that makes me far right then so be it." Orla has lived near Epping since she was a child and describes herself as a "very boring woman who has worked in the City of London for 25 years". The latest round of demonstrations began at the 80-room Bell in July, after a man living in the hotel was arrested, and subsequently charged, with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity. It's not a balanced culture." Orla Minihane is involved in the asylum hotel protests in Epping The protests have been promoted on social media under red, white and blue banner text with slogans such as "Protect Our Community", "Safety of Women and Children Before Foreigners" and "All Patriots Welcome". The activist group Stand Up To Racism sees this as far-right organisations "stirring up racist violence" and trying to repeat the violence that flared after the murders of three young girls in Southport. Outside The Bell, which is surrounded by steel fencing and guarded by a 24/7 security team, one of its residents, Wael, from Libya, is a year into his asylum claim and waiting for his fourth Home Office interview. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Anti-fascists gathered outside the Barbican Thistle Hotel in London last weekend to support the asylum seekers inside The police have largely kept control, sometimes facing criticism for their methods, including the false claim that Essex Police used buses to transport pro-migrant activists to a protest in Epping. "Everyone knows they are asylum seekers," Orla says, "Epping is very white." She adds of the hotel's occupants: "You know they are coming for freebies and when they come here they abuse the privilege. Successive governments have judged that paying for their accommodation and food is preferable to allowing them to compete with British workers in the jobs market, offering an incentive to come here. Asylum seekers recently arrived during the small hours at the wharf-side four-star Britannia International - 610 rooms, but, according to a maintenance engineer, no longer the "luxury hotel" described in some reports. Jack Taylor/Getty Images Rival protesters outside the Britannia International hotel, in late July It can be very hard to establish basic facts about the young men in the hotels, the system that put them there, or the impact they might have on locals. While growing in number, asylum seekers who come by small boats across the English Channel are a small proportion of total immigration to the UK, and in 2024, just over a third of all asylum seekers. Madeleine Sumption from the Migration Observatory points out there is a problem publishing information about small groups of asylum seekers when it might identify them by age or sex, a long-standing approach for public bodies. "If they said there are 70 in the Bell Hotel, five are from Sudan, five from somewhere else, I think most people would feel better." Epping Forest District Council's Conservative Leader, Chris Whitbread recently said that "it is important to be transparent" about asylum hotel information. "It is clear that the Home Office still has a long way to go to build trust and confidence in its willingness to be open and honest about its intentions and performance," he wrote. On the other side of the political divide from the anti-migrant campaigners, in north London outside a meeting "to organise against the right wing", Sabby Dhalu from the protest group Stand Up To Racism wants the government to work more closely with councils so that their residents are better informed.

Article: Elon Musk's AI accused of making explicit AI Taylor Swift videos 3 hours ago Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save Getty Images Elon Musk's AI video generator has been accused of making "a deliberate choice" to create sexually explicit clips of Taylor Swift without prompting, says an expert in online abuse. According to a report by The Verge, Grok Imagine's new "spicy" mode "didn't hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos" of the pop star without being asked to make explicit content. She added: "It was shocking how fast I was just met with it - I in no way asked it to remove her clothing, all I did was select the 'spicy' option." Gizmodo reported similarly explicit results of famous women, though some searches also returned blurred videos or with a "video moderated" message. Under new UK laws which entered into force at the end of July, platforms which show explicit images must verify users' ages using methods which are "technically accurate, robust, reliable and fair". "We are aware of the increasing and fast-developing risk GenAI tools may pose in the online space, especially to children, and we are working to ensure platforms put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate these risks," it said in a statement. "It is essential that these models are not used in such a way that violates a woman's right to consent whether she be a celebrity or not," Lady Owen continued in a statement given to BBC News.

Article: Jim Lovell, who guided Apollo 13 safely back to Earth, dies aged 97 6 hours ago Share Save Share Save NASA Astronaut Jim Lovell, who guided the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth in 1970, has died aged 97. Nasa said he had "turned a potential tragedy into a success" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. Getty Images The crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13: Jack Swigert, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic.

"Please be advised," he said as the radio crackled back into life, "there is a Santa Claus." At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. "Happy Christmas," said the card that came with it, "and love from the Man in the Moon."

Article: Sturgeon memoir describes arrest as 'worst day of my life' 8 hours ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland Editor Craig Williams BBC Scotland News Share Save Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon's memoir Frankly is due to be published next week Scotland's former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described her arrest by police investigating the SNP's finances as the worst day of her life. Elsewhere in the extracts, the former SNP leader describes the pain of suffering a miscarriage and sets out her views on sexuality, which she says she does not consider "to be binary". "It was with a sense of utter disbelief that I realised the police were in my home, that they had a warrant to arrest my husband and search the house," she writes. Sturgeon said that during the period between the raid on their home in April 2023 and her arrest she felt like she "had fallen into the plot of a dystopian novel." When she was arrested, she was: "Horrified and devastated, though also relieved in a strange sort of way. I went to a friend's house in the northeast of Scotland and stayed for a week." She said the day when she was informed that no action would be taken against her, a day on which Mr Murrell appeared again in court, was "a day of deeply mixed emotions." "The feeling of relief, and release, was overwhelming," she writes. Nicola Sturgeon describes the experience of having the media camped outside her home during the Branchform investigation Sturgeon also talks in detail about her experience of becoming pregnant and suffering a miscarriage aged 40 in 2010.

Article: Faith, family and fish - the unlikely bond between JD Vance and David Lammy 3 hours ago Share Save Kate Whannel Political reporter Share Save PA Media JD Vance and David Lammy fishing together at Chevening in Kent US Vice President JD Vance is taking his holiday in the UK - a trip which will include visits to the Cotswolds, Scotland and, to kick it all off, a few days staying with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his grace-and-favour country home, Chevening House in Kent. "Our families enjoy each other's company very much, which always helps." Chevening is set in 3,000 acres of land, including a maze and lake, which was the first destination for the two families on Friday morning, for a spot of fishing. Strictly speaking, the 17th century manor house belongs to the nation, but cabinet ministers, particularly foreign secretaries, are allowed to use it for family getaways or meetings with foreign dignitaries. Getty Images Chevening House, the 17th century stately home made available to foreign secretaries, comes with a lake and maze Vance acknowledged the two men come from "different political spectrums" but said Lammy had been "kind enough to make time on a visit to [Washington] DC, we got to know each other a little bit then". Since that first meeting, when Lammy was in opposition and Vance had just been elected to the US Senate, they have met regularly including at the new Pope's inauguration in May. That is why Lammy - despite his natural affiliation with the Democratic Party in the US - was tasked with building bridges with their Republican opponents, even before the general election.

Article: Police 'sat on information' before man, 80, killed 9 hours ago Share Save Navtej Johal BBC News, Midlands correspondent Katie Thompson BBC News Share Save Supplied Bhim Kohli died on 2 September last year, a day after he was attacked while walking his dog Police "sat on information" that could have prevented a fatal attack on an elderly man due to shift patterns and a bank holiday, his daughter has said. Bhim Kohli, 80, was punched and kicked by a 14-year-old boy while a girl, 12, filmed the attack in September - two weeks after he had witnessed another Asian man being racially abused and assaulted by two other boys nearby. Now a report - given to Susan Kohli - shows police knew the identities of the pair involved in the previous assault days after it happened, but did not arrest them until after her father's death. Warning: This article contains racially-offensive language Ms Kohli believes her father "would still be here" had police acted sooner over the previous attack, which occurred on 17 August 2024 near Franklin Park in Braunstone Town, Leicestershire - about two weeks before Mr Kohli's death following the assault at the same park. He died the day after he was subjected to the "seven-and-a-half minute period of continuing aggression", for which the boy and girl, now aged 15 and 13 respectively, were both convicted of manslaughter. Footage of the earlier attack was filmed by Susan Kohli Meanwhile, the victim of the 17 August 2024 attack was targeted by two white boys, aged 12 and 13, who threw a large rock at him yards from Mr Kohli's house. The pair - who were not involved in Mr Kohli's death - spat at the man, repeatedly threw stones at him, taunted him and shouted at him to "go back to your village". Near the end of footage, filmed by Ms Kohli, one of the boys can be heard using a four-letter racial slur and telling the man his dad is a "curry muncher". A rock - like these pictured in the area - was thrown at the man by two children During the trial of Mr Kohli's killers, the court was told about an occasion "a week or two" before his death when the convicted girl was present while other children threw apples at him. And the BBC was previously told it was reported to police that in July last year, Mr Kohli had stones thrown at him, was spat at and had been racially abused by a group of children after he told them to get off his neighbour's garage roof. After Mr Kohli's death, Leicestershire Police conducted an investigation - reviewed by the IOPC - into the case and the force's previous contact with Mr Kohli, which did not identify any "misconduct or missed opportunities which could have prevented his death". A report detailing the investigation, seen by the BBC, reveals a further eight reports of similar incidents between June and August last year have been made to the police since Mr Kohli's death. Susan Kohli wants the police investigation to be reviewed again In an email, Ms Kohli was told the officer in charge of the investigation into the assault on 17 August 2024 was on rest days, early and night shifts - and there was a bank holiday weekend - so "demand on policing would have been high". to have words with these boys or arrest them?" Mr Kohli was found injured in Franklin Park by his children Ms Kohli said it was only when she was given the report, which has not been made public, that she was made aware of the delay and sought further information from police. "It worries me that the IOPC didn't ask for that information." The report concluded any action, or lack of action by police, did not cause or contribute to Mr Kohli's death. "Leicestershire Police need to hold some accountability." CCTV showed the moments before Mr Kohli was fatally attacked Ch Supt Jonathan Starbuck, of Leicestershire Police, said the force recognised the concerns raised by Ms Kohli regarding anti-social behaviour in the Franklin Park area during the summer of 2024. He added: "We continue to monitor the area of Franklin Park and have engaged with the community through a local survey, drop-in centres, engagement with local schools, youth work and proactive policing patrols." A spokesperson for the IOPC said it had reviewed Leicestershire Police's report into the investigation. "And we agreed with learning identified by the force in respect of accurately recording and tagging incidents of anti-social behaviour, thus ensuring incidents can be dealt with appropriately and to support the long-term management and deterrence of ASB." The sentence given to the boy, who was convicted of Mr Kohli's manslaughter, is set to be reviewed.

They're not here among us." Under the plans announced last night - and agreed by Israel's security cabinet - the Israeli military would take control of Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of people, with a view, it says, to disarming Hamas, freeing the hostages, and establishing security control over the Strip. The plan has been met with heavy condemnation by much of the international community, with United Nations (UN) human rights chief Volker Türk saying it would "result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes". AFP Israeli air strikes continued in Gaza City on Friday AFP "And it's going to be a death sentence to every Palestinian, I think the whole population in Gaza will be killed, either by bombardment or by hunger." Local resident Dr Hatem Qanoua said: "We're collapsing across every aspect of life: food, education, healthcare. They've only known death, destruction, and deprivation." More than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military began its operation, in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since the start of 2025, at least 99 people, including 29 children under the age of five, have died of malnutrition, according to the World Health Organization - which says its figures are likely underestimates.

Article: US diplomat says UK would have lost WW2 with Starmer as leader 7 hours ago Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save Reuters The US ambassador to Israel has criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's reaction to Israel's Gaza City takeover plan The UK would have lost World War Two if Sir Keir Starmer had been its leader at the time, the US ambassador to Israel has suggested in an attack on the prime minister's response to Israel's Gaza City takeover plan. In a post on social media, Mike Huckabee wrote: "So Israel is expected to surrender to Hamas & feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?" "Did UK surrender to Nazis and drop food to them? If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!" During World War Two, British and American forces dropped 4,000 tons of bombs on the eastern German city over two days, killing tens of thousands of civilians. In the early hours of Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet approved plans to take over Gaza's capital, in a controversial escalation of its war in the territory. Netanyahu has previously said he wants to take control of the whole of the Gaza Strip but the approved plan focuses specifically on Gaza City in the territory's north, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live. Following the announcement of Israel's plan, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the country would suspend the export of arms to Israel, which could be used in Gaza, saying it was "increasingly difficult to understand" how Israel's military plan would achieve legitimate aims. During a meeting with the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kent on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance refused to disclose whether the US government knew about Israel's plans to take over Gaza City.

"By choosing military escalation over negotiation, we are leaving our loved ones at the mercy of Hamas," the group said in a statement. The Israeli prime minister's announcement of plans to take control of Gaza City has been met with concern in Israel, particularly by families of hostages still being held by Hamas. Anat Angrest, the mother of hostage Matan Angrest, said at the time: "For a year and 10 months we've been trying to believe that everything is being done to bring them back - you have failed." The group's collective statement, published on Friday following the announcement, accused the government of "leading us toward a colossal catastrophe". More widely within the country Tal Schneider, political correspondent at the Times of Israel, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday there had been a "huge public backlash" in Israel against the plans. I think we should do something about [...] Hamas anyway, but not at this time." Israeli resident Talya Saltzman also told Reuters bringing the hostages home should be "first and foremost". "It just doesn't seem that there's any real forward movement with this plan and unless we can get rid of all of Hamas in one go [I] just think that the hostages need to be top priority and then we need to stop all of our soldiers from dying."

Article: JD Vance questions UK's Palestinian statehood plan 10 hours ago Share Save Joshua Nevett Political reporter Share Save Watch: US has "no plans to recognise the state of Palestine", says JD Vance US Vice-President JD Vance has raised questions about the UK's plans to recognise a Palestinian state, in a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The difference in approach to the war in Gaza is among the issues being discussed by Vance and Lammy at the foreign secretary's official country residence, Chevening House, in Kent on Friday. "I don't know what it would mean to really recognise a Palestinian state – given the lack of a functional government there." The vice-president said the US administration wanted to see Hamas eradicated so Israeli civilians were not attacked again, but also to solve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. "We are hugely concerned by the humanitarian suffering that we are seeing in Gaza particularly." Striking a warm tone, Vance spoke of his love for England and praised his "good friend" the foreign secretary. PA Vance and Lammy went fishing for carp at Chevening's lake before their meeting Lammy and Vance have been meeting regularly on official trips since the foreign secretary started in his role last year, and they have bonded over their difficult childhoods and shared Christian faith. Vance said: "Obviously, I've raised some criticism and concerns about our friends on this side of the Atlantic, but the thing that I say to the people of England, or anybody else, to David, is many of the things that I worry most about were happening in the United States from 2020 to 2024. "I just don't want other countries to follow us down what I think is a very dark path under the Biden administration." The other major area for discussion this weekend is Ukraine and the possibility of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss the conflict. What Lammy, and other European nations, fear is that Putin will seek to use Trump to force terms on Ukraine without its presence at the table, and in a way that seriously undermines Europe's security. Trump met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, agreeing a trade deal with the bloc, and will return for a full state visit in September.

Article: Prince Andrew book seals his fate for any return 3 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save Getty Images Prince Andrew faces an unflattering portrait of his private life and finances This searing biography of Prince Andrew crackles with scandals about sex and money on almost every page, two subjects that have always caused problems for the royals. Getty Images Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein and Melania Trump [L] at Mar-a-Lago This account, more than 450 pages, is said to have taken four years to research, involving hundreds of interviews. This detail tallies with a piece in the New York Times this week that quotes a birthday greeting written by Allen to Epstein, which references "even royalty" being at one of Epstein's dinners. Getty Images Prince Andrew has stepped down as a working royal To rapidly lose some mid-life weight, when he was going out with a younger woman, the book records that Prince Andrew lived on a crash diet of "stewed prunes for breakfast, raw vegetables for lunch and soup for supper". Now in disgrace, Prince Andrew is claimed to spend his time, when not riding or golfing, cooped up watching aviation videos and reading thrillers, with The Talented Mr Ripley said to be his favourite. There are some more gentle anecdotes about him, such as when he was a helicopter pilot and ferried a group of soldiers from a rifle range and decided to put down on the Sandringham estate. Getty Images Prince Andrew was known as 'Baby Grumpling' as a baby But the biography is much more crowded with anecdotes about his rudeness and his acute lack of self awareness, not to mention a prodigious number of quick-fire affairs. "He's been afforded every type of privilege, all his life, while displaying very poor judgement and getting into highly compromising situations." Known as "Baby Grumpling" in his early years, Andrew was claimed to have moved people from jobs because one was wearing a nylon tie, and another because he had a mole on his face. There are details of his unhappy knack of getting involved with all the wrong people in his money-making ventures, from Libyan gun runners and relations of dictators to a Chinese spy. "The public will be wanting to see some clear action on the King's part I think - particularly as Andrew's connections to Epstein are raked over again," says Prof Maclaran. Getty Images Sarah Ferguson at a charity event in the south of France last month If this seems like a torrent of bad news, the book also raises some deeper questions about what lies behind Prince Andrew's character. He showed authentic courage when he flew helicopters in the Falklands war and he was remembered as being willing to "muck in" during that stressful time, when crews were living on canned food rather than fine dining. One of his former naval colleagues went from seeing Andrew as "immature, privileged, entitled" to having a more sympathetic view of a character of "loneliness and insecurity", a public figure who was uncertain about how he fitted in with other people, and had ended up with the "wrong sort of friends". Lownie's book offers meticulous detail of the connections between Prince Andrew and the US financier and sex offender, establishing links that went back to the early 1990s, earlier than had previously been established. It is also strong on the unbalanced nature of their relationship, with a friend of Andrew's describing the prince's dealings with Epstein as "like putting a rattlesnake in an aquarium with a mouse". Getty Images The famous photo of Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Epstein's sleazy and abusive world, with its mix of easy money and exploitative sex, was ultimately a form of blackmail operation, claims Lownie's book. And Lownie's sources cast doubt on whether Epstein did take his own life, questioning the medical evidence and the series of unfortunate gaps in supervision in the jail where he was being held. After his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview and the court case with Virginia Giuffre - which he settled with a rejection of any wrongdoing - Prince Andrew has been pushed out of public life, no longer a "working royal". "This isn't good for the monarchy," he says, even though "King Charles and Prince William have sought to limit the reputational damage Andrew can have on 'brand Windsor'," says Owens.

A photograph of Jeffrey Epstein and his butler Valdson Vieira Cotrin is front and centre of front page, with the Telegraph reporting that Mr Cotrin does not believe the sex offender killed himself.

Article: Mark Schiefelbein/AP/AP President Trump said his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine is set to happen "very shortly" at a date and location that Trump said he would announce "a little bit later" on Friday. In response to the need for a permanent international court addressing crimes committed during war, the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, officially began operating in July 2002. The court doesn't have its own police force or enforcement body, so it relies on countries' cooperation to make arrests, transfer arrested people to ICC detention in The Hague and to enforce sentences. The court also issued warrants for Yoav Gallant, Israel's former defense minister, Muhammad Deif, Hamas' military chief whom Israel says it killed in August, as well as other Hamas officials. At the time, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told NPR, "There is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable. We support accountability for perpetrators of war crimes." Sponsor Message Khrushcheva said, "So for Putin, it's yet another confirmation for him that the West is fairly hypocritical, and so he doesn't pay attention to it." Back in September, Putin traveled to Mongolia, an ICC member since 2002. The view of the court is that, as a member state, Mongolia had an obligation to honor the ICC's arrest warrant, according to David Bosco, professor at Indiana University, who spoke to NPR's All Things Considered last year. While experts and analysts have long said the prospect of an arrest of Putin is extremely slim, it's unlikely that the Russian leader would take the chance and hold such a significant meeting on unfriendly ground, Khrushcheva said.

The signatories called on Muslim nations — particularly Arab states — to leverage their political and economic influence, including through measures such as severing ties with Israel, imposing oil and gas embargoes and opening border crossings for humanitarian aid. "We believe that the governments of the Muslim-majority nations of the world should not wait for the 'international community' to grow a conscience."

Article: ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: For the better part of a decade, federal government investigators have been looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and now people are investigating the investigations. intelligence regarding President Trump and Russia ahead of the 2016 election, and his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has declassified a House Intelligence Committee report which she argues implicates the Obama administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TULSI GABBARD: There is irrefutable evidence that detail how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew was false. They would obtain emails, and then at strategic times - to hurt one of the campaigns, the Clinton campaign; to detract attention from, for example, when the Access Hollywood tape came out - they would drop a new tranche of documents that was trying to shift media focus. And so these three forms of interference were what the intelligence agencies - the FBI, the CIA and the NSA - wrote about when they described Russian interference in their reports. Huge, five-volume report - looked at the data that social media platforms turned over from the Russian trolls, for example; looked at all of the different ways that the hack-and-leak operations had been used to try to shift the public narrative, to transform the media conversation. SHAPIRO: And in the present day, as director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and attorney general Pam Bondi both try to revisit this, there seem to be a couple things they're focusing on, which I'd love for you to explain for us. DIRESTA: So Russian interference asks the question, how did Russia manipulate the 2016 election, or how did they seek to engage with the American public and to put false information out into the public in ways that would potentially further their strategic interests? And that's because in July of 2016, there was a tip from Australian intelligence saying, hey, there are these aides from the Trump campaign who are bragging about knowledge that Moscow has a tranche of emails that are going to be damaging to Hillary Clinton. The allegation that Russia, quote, "wanted Hillary to win" hinges on one report that they declassified - an investigation run by Devin Nunes, who's now the CEO of Truth Social, who at the time ran the House Select Committee on Intelligence. Now, that investigation alleges that there is a tranche of emails held by Russian intelligence - the SVR specifically - that were - that are shockingly damaging to Hillary Clinton, that say that she was on all sorts of tranquilizers, that say that she has emotional problems. But because Russia did not release these shocking emails that nobody has ever seen, that is the argument that they make to justify the fact that Russia wanted Hillary to win. Because they did not hurt her as much as they theoretically could have is the argument Gabbard and the others are making - that means that they could have wanted her to win. SHAPIRO: When you have director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassifying documents reportedly over the objections of the CIA, when you have Pam Bondi assigning prosecutors to look into some of these former senior intelligence officials who oversaw these investigations, what does that do for the ability of this country to conduct intelligence work?

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020. Key false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said. “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.” Broadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs Lou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.” “Yes. Key false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said. Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’” Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion. Broadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani Statements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Key false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.

Key false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said. Key false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said. “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said. “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated. We have tremendous evidence already … of fraud in this election, but I will be glad to put forward on this broadcast whatever evidence you have, and we’ll be glad to do it immediately.” Broadcast 18: Tweet from Dobbs The broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded video of Powell interview on December 10, 2020.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Link: https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/politics/mccarthy-biden-debt-ceiling/index.html
Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Article: CNN — A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family. Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

Article: The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

Article: The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University. READ MORE: Funding freeze could set research back years, Harvard scientists say The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.” This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations. WATCH: A look at ‘Project Esther’ and Trump’s approach to combat antisemitism on campus As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community.

Article: “We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” RAED MORE: ‘Houston, we’ve had a problem’: Remembering Apollo 13 at 50 One of NASA’s most traveled astronauts in the agency’s first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth’s orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew’s Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ”Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.” A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I’m still breathing.’ So, I don’t worry about crises.” And the mission’s retelling in the popular 1995 movie “Apollo 13” brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame — thanks in part to Lovell’s movie persona reporting “Houston, we have a problem,” a phrase he didn’t exactly utter. I measure risk.’” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not,” he remarked. “I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program,” Gene Kranz, NASA’s legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks’ portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell’s last mission — immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell — that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. READ MORE: Apollo 13’s most famous quotes originated in Hollywood That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn’t have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA’s historian. In Hanks’ version, it became “Houston, we have a problem.” What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA’s finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong’s and Buzz Aldrin’s walks on the moon nine months earlier. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon “is my one regret,” Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, “The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction.” And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote “Lost Moon,” the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film “Apollo 13.” In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Bondi said the Justice Department has seized more than $700 million in assets linked to Maduro, including two private jets, and said nearly 7 tons of seized cocaine had been traced directly to the leftist leader. overdose deaths fell by 27% last year — the largest one-year decline ever recorded Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil released a statement characterizing the reward as “pathetic” and accusing Bondi of orchestrating a “crude political propaganda operation.” “We’re not surprised, coming from whom it comes from. The same one who promised a nonexistent ‘secret list’ of Epstein and who wallows in scandals for political favors,” Gil said, referring to the backlash Bondi faced after the Justice Department announced last month that a long-rumored “client list” of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein does not exist.

Article: Lovell Jr., the American astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 spacecraft on its lunar voyage in 1970 and shepherded it on a perilous four-day journey back to Earth after an oxygen tank exploded, an ordeal that transfixed the world, died Aug. The legacy of Apollo 13 was more complicated — a terrifying episode that spoke to the skill and levelheadedness of the crew trying to stabilize their spacecraft and Mission Control managers back in Houston. Lovell had participated in three earlier missions, notably on the 1968 voyage aboard the Apollo 8 mission — the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the moon and return safely to Earth. Advertisement Apollo 13, which took off on April 11, 1970, was meant to be NASA’s third lunar landing, a mission that entailed visiting a new landing site and retrieving rock samples. “That’s when the ol’ lead weight went down to the bottom of my stomach,” he once told an interviewer, “and I thought that we were really in deep trouble.” That unease prompted one of the most harrowing moments in spaceflight history, and surely one of its greatest understatements. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With plans for the lunar landing quickly abandoned, NASA directed the crew to switch off the ship’s damaged service module and turn the lunar lander, which had its own air supply, into a jury-rigged lifeboat. The three men crowded into a spacecraft meant to carry two and settled in for a 90-hour flight — twice as long as the Aquarius Lunar Module was built to operate. Even with barely enough resources to ration their way through a slingshot around the moon and a journey home, there was the problem of trajectory: The ship was now on course to miss Earth by thousands of miles. Using only the Earth in the window as an indication of their position — the computer systems had all been turned off to conserve the ship’s scant electricity for reentry — Mr. Advertisement The task was made onerous by the ship’s newfound center of gravity: Aquarius was only meant to be piloted once it had disconnected from the bulky command and service modules. (One of the heroes of that project, NASA engineer Ed Smylie, died in April at 95.) Advertisement Advertisement Then the crew endured four days of dehydration, sleep deprivation and near-freezing temperatures so demoralizing that they ripped the heart rate sensors from their bodies in defiance of NASA’s medical team. “He said, ‘My feeling was that it was like playing a game of solitaire,’” said science and technology journalist Jeffrey Kluger, who co-wrote “Lost Moon” (1994) and became an editor at Time magazine. Then there was the question of the heat shield: Mission Control couldn’t be sure what shape it was in after the explosion, leaving the possibility of a tragic disintegration during the final leg of Apollo 13’s journey. He told friends that returning to family life put his orbital exploits into perspective: When he got home, he still had a mortgage to pay and kids to put through college. Lovell’s legacy in the public’s mind may have been defined by his actions aboard Apollo 13, but he frequently said that he considered Apollo 8, where he helped pilot the first crewed mission to orbit the moon, to be the highlight of his NASA career. Advertisement Advertisement Apollo 8 was originally envisioned as an orbital trip around the Earth, but rumors that Soviets were preparing for a moon orbit prompted NASA to retool the mission. In a decisive moment, he helped spot a scene that would become the iconic photograph known as “Earthrise,” documenting the moment they became the first humans to see Earth peek into view over the moon’s barren surface.

Article: The Queens shelter, called Ace’s Place, which officially opened this week, will be fully funded by the city at a cost of nearly $66 million over the next five years, according to Neha Sharma, a spokesperson for the city’s social services department. The shelter’s creation comes as the Trump administration and some state governments are attempting to roll back rights for transgender people, including curtailing access to gender-affirming health care, participation in high school sports and service in the military. Advertisement “It’s a site that has been in the works for quite a while but it really is meaningful in this moment in time when the rights of the LGBT community as a whole, but particularly trans individuals, are under attack,” she said. “I feel like the city had our back,” said Coleman, who said that as an organizer of Bronx Pride he saw corporations pull back from sponsorships amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. So I was incredibly happy to learn that they were 100 percent behind making sure that we got the project up and running.” Advertisement Studies show that transgender people disproportionately experience homelessness. In 2020, researchers at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that eight percent of transgender adults reported indicators of recent homelessness — compared to one percent of straight cisgender adults. Jawanza Williams, the director of movement building at VOCAL-NY, a group that advocates for people impacted by homelessness, celebrated the new facility as a win for those who feel “unsafe in shelter systems that aren’t accounting for the unique needs and experiences of trans people.” Advertisement The shelter will provide a chance for trans people who are homeless to be surrounded by other people who share similar experiences, which can be “nurturing and important for people’s well-being,” said Stephen Russell, a researcher at Arizona State University who has studied homelessness among LGBTQ+ Americans. That feeling of safety, Russell said, can in turn provide the context for homeless transgender people “to make their way to stable housing.” Coleman said that his goal for Ace’s Place — named after his late mother, who struggled with drug addiction and to whom his grandmother would always open her home — is “economic empowerment.” Services at the shelter will include culinary classes, an on-site psychiatrist, job placement services and a housing specialist who will help those staying at the facility secure more permanent housing, Coleman said. “If you want to address homelessness, you have to have services that target the communities who are homeless,” said Christine Quinn, a former New York City council speaker and the CEO of Win, the largest provider of shelter and supportive housing for the city’s homeless families. Advertisement The shelter comes after the city agreed, as part of a lawsuit settlement in 2021, to reserve a minimum of 30 shelter beds for transgender and gender nonconforming clients across the city’s shelters. “Despite a presidential administration focused on taking America backwards and making homelessness worse, states can and must focus on real solutions to homelessness, like housing and support,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center, an advocacy group that has tracked a spike in what it calls “anti-homeless” local ordinances around the country in the past year.

District Judge Kathleen Williams ordering a two-week halt to new construction at the facility in the Everglades followed a hearing in a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians. “We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” Eve Samples, executive director at Friends of the Everglades, said in a statement. Anna Eskamani (D), who testified at the hearing in support of the conservation groups, called the order “a necessary and welcome step in stopping a project that never should have been approved in the first place.” “This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country. It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources,” Eskamani said in a statement. “Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts.” Advertisement Conservation groups sued the state and the federal government on June 27, four days after Florida began setting up what DeSantis called “a makeshift” detention center next to Everglades National Park and within Big Cypress National Preserve. Advertisement It is unclear when that will be, though, with the state at the forefront of assisting the Department of Homeland Security in detaining immigrants and DeSantis planning to open at least one more facility in north Florida. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday’s ruling “is another attempt to prevent the president from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations.” Noem said similar detention centers might be built in other states.

Article: The decision is the latest in a series of moves by President Trump’s administration to restore Confederate names and symbols that had been discarded as part of the nation’s racial reconciliation efforts following George Floyd’s murder in 2020. “I’m proud to announce that Moses Ezekiel’s beautiful and historic sculpture — often referred to as “The Reconciliation Monument” — will be rightfully be returned to Arlington National Cemetery near his burial site,” Hegseth posted on X, referring to the memorial’s creator. Unlike the Left, we don’t believe in erasing American history — we honor it.” The 32-foot bronze statue commissioned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy was unveiled at a ceremony presided over by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914, almost 50 years after the Civil War ended. But critics said the memorial glorified the Southern cause and glossed over slavery, with elements such as a frieze showing an enslaved Black man following his owner and an enslaved woman — described on the cemetery’s website as a “mammy” — holding the baby of a Confederate officer. Advertisement “We are grateful for the care being taken to preserve and display this statue, which allows us to better understand the complex history of the United States,” he said. Hegseth’s announcement that the Confederate memorial would return to Arlington came a day after the National Park Service said a statue of Confederate general Albert Pike, torn down and set on fire by protesters in 2020, would return to its original site in Washington D.C. In March, Trump issued an executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” that included a section saying the administration would “determine whether, since January 1, 2020, public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.” It said it would take action to reinstate those monuments, memorials and statues. Advertisement The Confederate Memorial’s removal from Arlington was ordered by the bipartisan Naming Commission, which was established by Congress in 2021 and prompted in part by the calls for racial justice following George Floyd’s murder. “This is not some woke thing, it’s the will of the American people that Secretary Hegseth is going against.” The monument, Seidule said, “is the cruelest I’ve ever seen because it’s a pro-slavery, pro-segregation, anti-United States monument. It’s a Confederate monument and it’s meant to say that the white South was right and the United States of America was wrong.” In its decision recommending the Confederate Memorial at Arlington for removal, the commission cited imagery on the memorial and an accompanying Latin phrase celebrating the Lost Cause retelling of the Confederacy. Advertisement “This narrative of the Lost Cause, which romanticized the pre-Civil War South and denied the horrors of slavery, fueled White backlash against Reconstruction and the rights that the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments (1865-1870) had granted to African Americans,” the commission wrote. “This was a memorial to men who committed treason in defense of the supposed right of some humans to ‘own’ other humans as property,” James Grossman, former executive director of the American Historical Association, told The Washington Post on the day the sculpture was removed from Arlington National Cemetery. “The very idea that this monument was still here until today reminds us not just how far we’ve come but how much further we have to go.” In addition to recommending the removal of the Confederate memorial, the naming commission also identified nine army bases for name changes, including Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Pickett in Virginia, Fort Benning in Georgia and Fort Hood in Texas. The Defense Department renamed the bases for individuals who had served in the military and had the same last name as the Confederates for whom the bases were originally named.

Officers found the suspect on the second floor of the CVS, but it was unclear if the person had been struck in an exchange of gunfire with the police or the gunshot was self-inflicted, Chief Darin Schierbaum of the Atlanta Police Department said at a news conference on Friday evening.

Paxton had warned absent Democrats that he would begin proceedings if enough Democrats did not return to the Texas Capitol to allow a vote on the proposed map, which was designed to flip as many as five Democratic seats in the U.S. He made good on that threat about an hour after the Texas House met for just eight minutes on Friday, long enough to determine that Democrats had ignored the Republicans’ deadline.

Article: A police officer was killed after authorities say an active shooter opened fire near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters and Emory University's Atlanta campus on Friday afternoon. A DeKalb County Police officer, who officials have not yet identified, was taken to a local hospital after the shooting, where he was in critical condition and later pronounced dead, officials said in a press conference Friday evening. Responding DeKalb County police officers located the suspect on the second floor of the Emory Point CVS Pharmacy across the street from the CDC building and attempted to engage the person when gunfire was exchanged, police said. Susan Monarez shared a statement on X on Friday night, saying she and the agency as a whole are "heartbroken by today’s attack on our Roybal Campus, which remains on lockdown as authorities investigate the shooting." "Our top priority is the safety and well-being of everyone at CDC," Monarez continued. "We are actively coordinating with federal, state, and local partners to fully investigate the shooter and this tragic crime." In an email to CDC staff, obtained by ABC News, Monarez encourageed employees to "prioritize your well-being, seek support, and reach out for assistance as needed." Monday will be a remote workday for all CDC employees, according to the email. Brian Kemp released a statement on X thanking first responders for rushing "toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives." "We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center," Kemp wrote. Jeff Amy/AP Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement Friday, saying, "We're horrified by the news out of Emory University and praying for the safety of the entire campus community."

Article: A White House official says the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. “Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” said Milliken, who started as president last week. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.” California Gov. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: “We will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.” The $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom’s status as one of Trump’s most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents. “Of course it’s influenced by the fact that UCLA sits within the California system and the California system sits within the state of California.” The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

One of the wounded troopers commandeered a tractor trailer to block the roadway and prevent other motorists from driving into harm’s way as police say Faino continued to shoot, targeting a police drone as he holed up near a propane tank that officials feared could be used as a bomb. I would say you can draw certain conclusions from the standpoint that we believe Faino shot our victim prior to our arrival and then from a position of tactical advantage fired dozens and dozens of rounds,” state police Col. He said Trooper Joseph Perechinsky applied a tourniquet to his injured colleague, Trooper William Jenkins, and, despite his own injuries, ordered the driver of a tractor trailer to block the road.

It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in “confined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures” at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility. Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies “Buddy” and “George of the Jungle.” Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie “Buddy” alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2022 that she lied to protect Tonka from “the evil clutches of PETA.” She also admitted what happened in the third episode of “Chimp Crazy,” which premiered last year, saying, “Tonka was literally on the run with me.” Just last month, investigators found another chimp locked up in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach in violation of court orders, documents in the case said. "In the face of these harsh realities threaded throughout her life, Haddix came to form secure attachments with animals.” PETA praised the sentence in a news release, saying that Haddix now “can't hurt another chimpanzee.”

Article: At the core of the fight in Texas over redrawing the state’s congressional districts is a debate over a time-honored right spelled out in the Constitution: Every two years, “the People” get to pick someone to represent their interests in the U.S. The question is at the heart of a power play in Texas, where Republicans are trying to reshape the state’s congressional boundaries to help them maintain control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. It’s states where one party controls all the levers of government where redistricting dramas like the one in Texas often play out as the majority tries to maximize its power. President Donald Trump, who's pushing Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their maps, said this week Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in Texas based in part on the size of his win there in November. Trump won 56% of the Texas vote, but Republicans already hold 65% of the state's congressional delegation — which would rise to 79% if the GOP's new maps are adopted and past voting patterns hold in the next election. In 41 of the 44 states with more than one congressional district, the party of the winning presidential candidate had a larger share of the state’s congressional seats than its share of the presidential vote, an Associated Press analysis found. Here’s a comparison of the congressional delegations and presidential vote results in a sampling of states, including some of those considering a redraw of their congressional boundaries after Texas called its special session. “You notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered,” he said in reference to the Texas Democrats who relocated to the Chicago area to block, at least temporarily, the Republican redistricting efforts. California's lopsided map is due in part to the way like-minded people cluster: California Democrats tend to live in and near major cities that get more congressional districts because of their population. With Democratic advantages in both chambers of the state Legislature, New York might have been a ripe target for Democrats looking to offset Republican redistricting gains in Texas and elsewhere. After the 2020 census, a Democratic-majority North Carolina Supreme Court threw out a Republican-drawn plan and permitted elections under a map adopted by trial judges that produced the 7-7 split. After flipping to a Republican majority in 2023, the state Supreme Court ruled partisan gerrymandering wasn’t outlawed by the state constitution, allowing GOP lawmakers to redraw a congressional map in use today that led to their party’s 10-4 majority. Nevada, where a Democratic Legislature drew the lines, is the only state where the party of the winning presidential candidate is outnumbered by the other party in the state’s congressional delegation.

Walker/The Boston Globe via AP) BOSTON -- A sheriff in one of Massachusetts' largest counties was charged Friday with allegedly pressuring a Boston-based cannabis firm to sell him stock in the company.

An officer mistook the 30-year-old as someone involved in an armed robbery earlier in the evening and shot him in the back as he fled from a police stop in November 2022. An internal affairs investigator had found the officer who shot Clark violated bureau policy; the city’s Police Review Board, which includes four members from the police department, two community members and an independent city staffer, voted 4-3 that the shooting was within policy, OPB reported. Police Chief Bob Day told councilors that while he was angered by Clark's death, it was his final decision to deem the shooting appropriate as he believed Officer Chris Sathoff acted reasonably according to the facts available at the time, OPB reported. The night of the shooting, a 911 caller told dispatchers he had been robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant by men who were “definitely white.” Officers mistook Clark's sedan as being involved in the robbery, and when they approached it in a church parking lot, Clark, who was Black, fled on foot.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday at a stately home south of London before heading off on a family vacation in the the Cotswolds, a trendy retreat in the English countryside. Vance and Lammy, who come from opposite ends of the political spectrum but have made a personal connection through their hardscrabble childhoods and Christian faith, will hold talks at the foreign secretary’s official country residence, known as Chevening. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also likely to be on the agenda amid debates between Washington and London about the best way to end those conflicts. Lammy and Vance will meet at Chevening, an almost 400-year-old mansion surrounded by 3,000 acres (about 1,200 hectares) of gardens, lawns and woodland in the county of Kent, southeast of London. While Lammy is a member of the left-leaning Labour Party and Vance is a conservative Republican who supports Trump’s “America First” agenda, the two men have bonded in recent months. Lammy told the Guardian newspaper that the two men can relate over their “dysfunctional” working class childhoods and that he considers Vance a “friend.” Lammy attended a Catholic Mass at the Vance home in Washington earlier this year, and the two men met again at the U.S. “So it was a wonderful hour and a half.” After spending a few days at Chevening, Vance and his family will head to the Cotswolds, an area that has become popular with wealthy American tourists because of its quaint villages, stone cottages and rural countryside that hark back to old England. A host of celebrities descended on the area two weeks ago for the wedding of Eve Jobs, the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, and Harry Charles, a member of the British equestrian team at last summer’s Olympic Games in Paris.

Article: The attorney for a Tennessee man who said he was “hurting so bad” during his lethal injection this week says his implanted defibrillator did not shock him during the execution Attorney says heart device did not shock Tennessee man in execution who said he was 'hurting so bad' NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who said he was “hurting so bad” during his lethal injection this week for the 1980s killings of his girlfriend and her two young daughters was not shocked by his implanted defibrillator, his attorney said Friday. The ICD information eliminates one possible cause for Black's comment about pain during his execution Tuesday, and other actions such as when he picked his head up off the gurney and groaned, she said. “Make no mistake, we all saw with our own eyes that the pentobarbital did not work like the State’s expert testified that it would," Henry said in her statement, referencing Tennessee's execution drug, pentobarbital. Black suffered.” Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to disable his ICD due to claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks to try to fix his heartbeat as the drugs were administered, potentially prolonging the execution. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Friday that news of the lack of a defibrillator shock was “just as the state’s medical expert predicted and entirely contrary to the confident predictions of Black’s expert.” Skrmetti cited Black’s numerous failed legal challenges and said, “Byron Black’s execution was entirely legal.” “Every American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty, but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion,” Skrmetti said in a statement. Ahead of that, when he was asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution began, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it’s hurting so bad,” Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his right arm visible to media witnesses. Before the execution, the state said in a court filing that a "lethal dose of pentobarbital ensures that Black will not be conscious to experience any pain." The state said unconsciousness occurs within 20 to 30 seconds of administering the drug, followed by respiratory arrest and cardiovascular collapse.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) WASHINGTON -- An advocacy group sued the Justice Department and the FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled. “The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials. Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation.

Article: An executive order signed by President Donald Trump aims to give political appointees power over the billions of dollars of grants that are awarded by federal agencies President Donald Trump speaks at an event to mark National Purple Heart Day in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Aug. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) NEW YORK -- An executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Thursday aims to give political appointees power over the billions of dollars in grants awarded by federal agencies. The order requires all federal agencies, including FEMA, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, to appoint officials responsible for reviewing federal funding opportunities and grants, so that they “are consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.” It also requires agencies to make it so that current and future federal grants can be terminated at any time — including during the grant period itself. The Trump administration said these changes are part of an effort to “strengthen oversight” and “streamline agency grantmaking.” Scientists say the order will cripple America's scientific engine by placing control over federal research funds in the hands of people who are influenced by politics and lack relevant expertise. “This is taking political control of a once politically neutral mechanism for funding science in the U.S.,” said Joseph Bak-Coleman, a scientist studying group decision-making at the University of Washington. The changes will delay grant review and approval, slowing "progress for cures and treatments that patients and families across the country urgently need,” said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement. The administration has already terminated thousands of research grants at agencies like the NSF and NIH, including on topics like transgender health, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion. The order could affect emergency relief grants doled out by FEMA, public safety initiatives funded by the Department of Justice and public health efforts supported by the Centers for Disease Control.

Article: -- Federal judges on Thursday ordered Alabama to continue using a court-selected congressional map for the rest of the decade, but they declined to put the state back under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act. The three-judge panel ordered the secretary of state to continue using the current congressional map, which was selected by the court last year, “until Alabama enacts a new congressional districting plan based on 2030 Census data” and said they will retain jurisdiction over the case until then. The judges rejected a request from plaintiffs to “bail in” Alabama under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act and submit the next-state-drawn congressional map for review before it is used. The judges wrote that they “discern no compelling reason to tread into such intrusive waters.” “And we will not, in an unrestrained attempt to resolve any hypothetical issue that may arise far down the road, assign to our Court the exceedingly intrusive task of supervising Alabama’s congressional elections for the next fifteen years,” the judges wrote. Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, had argued during a July hearing that preclearance was needed to ensure the state doesn’t “backslide.” Ross said Friday that even though the court rejected preclearance, his clients are pleased the court ordered Alabama to continue using the special master map through 2030. “This independently-drawn map respects Alabama’s many communities of interest, including the Black Belt, and ensures that Black voters will have a fair opportunity to elect congressional candidates of their choice for the rest of the decade,” Ross said.

Article: Adam Schiff, according to people familiar with the matter WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is escalating efforts to scrutinize perceived adversaries of President Donald Trump with investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and U.S. The Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to a lawsuit the Democrat filed against Trump over alleged fraud in his personal business dealings, according to a person familiar with the matter. The moves are among the most serious yet the Justice Department has taken against political foes of the president, who vowed on the campaign trail to seek retribution against his opponents. Schiff and James are both vocal critics of Trump, and James has sued Trump and his Republican administration dozens of times over his policies as president and over how he conducted his private business empire. News of the subpoenas comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” In a separate statement, James’ personal attorney, Abbe D. Lowell, called the subpoenas “improper.” “Investigating the fraud case Attorney General James won against President Trump and his businesses has to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign,” Lowell said. “Weaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration.” A spokesperson for the Justice Department, Natalie Baldassarre, declined to comment. “Any supposed investigation led by him would be the very definition of weaponization of the justice process.” Trump is appealing a $454 million judgment James won against him in a lawsuit alleging he and his companies defrauded banks and other lenders by giving them financial statements that inflated the value of his properties, including his golf clubs and his penthouse in Trump Tower. A jury last year found that LaPierre misspent millions of dollars of the organization’s money and used the funds to pay for an extravagant lifestyle, while the NRA itself failed to properly manage its assets and violated whistleblower protections. James had sought to dissolve the powerful gun advocacy organization altogether, though a judge ruled that the allegations did not warrant a “corporate death penalty.” LaPierre announced his resignation from the NRA on the eve of the trial, and the NRA later said it had fresh board members and a new compliance team.

Article: House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress. In an online post, Page wrote that state rules require the governor to issue a proclamation calling a statewide election at least 148 days before the date of the election — that would have been June 9. Page said if he waited for the Legislature and the governor to formally call the election, “it would be too late for me to actually conduct the election.” If it goes through, “We are going to make this work,” Page added.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith) Cambodian Buddhist monks march on a street as they organize a ceremony to offer prayers to the remains of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in battles with Thai troops along the disputed border areas, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Friday, Aug. (AP Photo/Heng Sinith) PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Hundreds of Buddhist monks in Cambodia on Friday held a religious ceremony to honor soldiers killed in recent border clashes with Thai forces and to pray for peace. They marched from the country’s main religious school near the Royal Palace in the capital, Phnom Penh, to a nearby temple, where they were joined by nuns and laymen and women. A ceasefire that took effect on July 29 ended major fighting, though both sides have alleged violations of the truce and the underlying dispute over territorial claims has not been resolved. Khem Sorn, the chief monk for Phnom Penh, said the main purpose of Friday’s ceremony was to show support to the government for working toward peace and ending the war with a ceasefire. It was also intended to honor to the souls of the Cambodian soldiers and civilians who were killed, and to appeal to all Buddhist countries, especially Thailand, to live in peace with each other, he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Talks in Malaysia on Thursday reaffirmed both sides’ commitment to the ceasefire deal but failed to secure the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers, who were captured in disputed circumstances after the truce went into effect. The United States and China, which both played an active role in encouraging an end to the fighting, separately hailed Thursday’s reaffirmation of the ceasefire, and said they look forward to supporting the parties involved in securing the peace process.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment Thursday that “Putin remains uninterested in ending his war and is attempting to extract bilateral concessions from the United States without meaningfully engaging in a peace process.” “Putin continues to believe that time is on Russia’s side and that Russia can outlast Ukraine and the West,” it said. Orbán said the leaders of Germany and France should go to Moscow “to negotiate on behalf of Europe.” Otherwise, “we will be sidelined in managing the security issues of our own continent,” Orbán told Hungary’s state broadcaster. Orbán, who is a harsh critic of the European Union to which his country belongs, said Europe’s concerns that a Trump-Putin summit might not address the continent’s interests meant it should seize the diplomatic initiative.

The family said it was Lungu's final wish that Hichilema should not get anywhere near his burial, but the Zambian government went to court to stop him being buried in South Africa. “Such that even if a president has expressed a desire not to be given a state funeral, such a wish must be overridden by public interest,” said Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba. Zambia's Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha welcomed the judgment, telling reporters that he hoped the ruling would bring the matter to a close even though the family still had a right to appeal. It's just what makes good sense, that the former president of the Republic of Zambia should be buried in his own country, the country where he was president,” said Kabesha.

(AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) FILE - Ukrainian lawmakers vote for a new bill proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to restore the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies at the parliament session hall in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country’s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia’s invasion. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties. But the previous level of trust “that he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged," said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy "will need to work hard to get it back.” A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law. The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore “lost trust.” Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, or SAPO. The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime. “It’s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,” Shevchuk said. Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions. Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy’s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported that the NABU and the SAPO were in the process of issuing a formal notice of suspicion against the businessman, who is involved in drone production. "But at the same time, people know what is happening with the close allies of the president, the allegations of corruption, so this does not go unnoticed.” The protests "were a reminder to the president from the people basically saying, ‘We see everything, remember everything. A readout of the call from Starmer’s office said the leaders "agreed on the importance of the role of independent anti-corruption institutions at the heart of Ukraine’s democracy.” In Germany, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed dismay when Zelenskyy approved the measures to reduce the powers of the NABU and the SAPO.

Erin Patterson was convicted by a Victoria state Supreme Court last month of murdering her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail’s sister Heather Wilkinson at her home in Leongatha with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries contained toxic death cap mushrooms. Simon Patterson testified before the trial that he suspected his wife had deliberately made him seriously ill with dishes including penne bolognese pasta, chicken korma curry and a vegetable curry wrap. Defense lawyer Colin Mandy argued that reporting of the suppressed evidence as well as references to it in books, podcasts and a planned television mini-series would “leave an indelible impression on the minds of potential jurors in the event that there is a retrial.” A hearing will begin on Aug.

(Monique Ford/Stuff via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Japanese warships docked in New Zealand ’s capital Friday for the first time in almost 90 years amid efforts by Tokyo to deepen its strategic ties in the South Pacific Ocean. The JS Ise and destroyer JS Suzunami were on an Indo-Pacific deployment and arrived from Sydney, where Japan’s military took part this month in war games involving New Zealand, Australia and other countries. The Wellington visit was a ceremonial one, but it came as Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions. “Our main goal is the free and open Indo-Pacific.” The ambassador’s remarks followed the announcement Tuesday by Australia’s government that Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had won the bid for a contract to build Australian warships, beating out a German firm. New Zealand too has sought to shore up its strategic and military relations in Asia as part of a foreign policy reset in recent years that the government says has turned more attention on Pacific cooperation and security. Japanese naval vessels do not often make visits so far south in the Pacific Ocean, but the rich and strategically important waters of New Zealand, Australia and smaller Pacific Island countries are increasingly contested by the world’s major powers, making it the site of a fierce battle for influence between Beijing and Western nations. In February, live firing exercises by Chinese naval frigates in the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia drew alarm from those countries’ governments after flights were forced to divert at short notice.

The declaration came at the conclusion of a one-day conference where some 400 representatives of Syria's ethnic and religious minorities gathered in an attempt to assert the rights of their communities in the country’s evolving political framework following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last December. In their statements, the representatives condemned recent acts of violence by pro-government gunmen against the country’s minorities — primarily Alawites, Druze and Christians — and argued that these amount to crimes against humanity. Ghazal Ghazal, the spiritual leader of Syria’s Alawite minority, to whom Assad belongs, said extremist ideology in Syria is imposing its will on Syrians in the name of religion and killing minorities. Hakemat Habib, one of the conference organizers, said that central governments and “tyrannical regimes” over the past decades have failed and that a democratic and decentralized state agreed upon by all Syrians is the only way to move forward. Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, whose fighters clashed with pro-government gunmen last month, told the conference in a televised speech that “pluralism is not a threat but a treasure that strengthens unity.” Also Friday, a top commander with the SDF, Sipan Hamo, blasted al-Sharaa’s government and accused it of continuing Syria's decades-old “dictatorship.” Hamo said in an interview with a local media outlet that the SDF wants to join the national army but the al-Sharaa’s government is not giving hope for a democratic state.

Article: Worries rise for civilians and hostages JERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, drawing a dismissal from the militant group and renewed international calls to end the conflict, while stirring fears for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told The Associated Press. Before Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had outlined more sweeping plans Thursday in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. “The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. Asked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza,” Netanyahu replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.” He added that Israel did not intend to “keep it.” Israel's new plan stopped short of that, and may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel's terms. Eyal Zamir, who reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years of regional wars. The military “will prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,” Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the meeting. Amir Avivi, a retired brigadier general and chairman of Israel’s Defense and Security Forum, estimated it would take less than three months to mobilize some 30,000 troops, evacuate Palestinian civilians and take over Gaza City. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media, said the group’s leadership has been aware of the Arab mediators’ efforts to revive the ceasefire talks, but has yet to receive details. envoy Steve Witkoff told hostage families during his recent visit that Israel was shifting its approach to pursue a comprehensive “all-or-nothing” deal aimed at ending the war and securing the release of hostages, a person who attended the meeting told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak about the private meeting.

Article: The pet of choice in Japan, as much as cuddly kitties and playful puppies, is the humble bug Toyoji Suzuki holds a beetle, known as Hercules, at an exhibition devoted to insects in Tokyo, Thursday, July 31, 2025. The bug has been a key part of Japanese culture from the Heian era classic “The Tale of Genji” to popular modern-day manga and animation like “Mushishi,” featuring insect-like supernatural creatures. If you catch and study them, you’re sure to discover something new,” says Munetoshi Maruyama, professor of bioenvironmental sciences at Kyushu University, whose fascination with bugs began as a child, like many Japanese. “They are so beautiful in shape and form.” One thrill that comes from studying insects is discovering a new species, simply because there are more than 1.2 million known kinds of insects, far more than mammals, which translates to a lot of undiscovered ones, said Maruyama, who has discovered 250 new insect species himself and shrugs that off as a relatively small number. “It’s fantastic that bugs can serve as a doorway to science.” The fact some insects go through metamorphoses, transforming from a larva to a butterfly, for instance, adds to the excitement, allowing kids to observe the stages of a life span, Maruyama said. The love affair with bugs was clear at an exhibit in Tokyo, aptly called “The Great Insect Exhibition,” running through the end of this month at the Sky Tree Tower, where crowds of children gathered around trees inside indoor cages so they could observe and touch the various beetles. One kind of rhinoceros beetle known as Hercules, which originated in the Caribbean but is now also found in Japan, is reputed to be the biggest beetle on record, although it’s just several inches in length. That’s really positive for the workings of a child’s brain,” said Toyoji Suzuki, one of the event’s organizers, who insisted everyone, including adults, touch the bottom of the beetles’ horns and wings to feel how surprisingly soft and fluffy they are. Four-year-old Asahi Yamauchi, who was at the exhibit with his grandmother and getting his photo taken inside a special installation that made it look like he was inside a beetle, loves bugs as much as he loves dinosaurs and has what he called a cute beetle as a pet at home.

Article: The Congolese government has reshuffled its cabinet to include opposition members, aiming to build support in regions it still controls By JEAN-YVES KAMALE Associated Press and JUSTIN KABUMBA Associated Press KINSHASA, Congo -- The Congolese government has reshuffled its cabinet which now includes opposition members in an effort to cobble together support across the remaining regions where the government still retains control. In a television address by the government spokesperson, Tina Salama, late Thursday, the government announced the 53 members of the new cabinet, including Adolphe Muzito, a former prime minister under former President Joseph Kabila as the vice prime minister in charge of the budget. Initially announced as a smaller cabinet, the new one remains bloated, only one fewer than than the last cabinet announced in May 2024 as an effort to retain broad support across the country.

(Dan Himbrechts/AAP Image via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- An Australian state lawmaker and convicted rapist, who is in jail awaiting his sentence, quit his seat Friday moments before a vote scheduled by his former colleagues to eject him. Gareth Ward, an independent member of parliament in New South Wales state, earlier refused to resign despite his July convictions by a jury for sex crimes against two young men. “If you’re convicted of some of the most serious charges, sexual assault in New South Wales, you can’t sit as a serving member of parliament drawing a parliamentary salary,” state Premier Chris Minns told reporters Friday. As lawmakers assembled to oust him from Parliament Friday morning — a measure expected to draw cross-party support — Ward wrote to the speaker of the house tendering his resignation. “I would have thought being a convicted rapist is enough infamy without going down in history as both a convicted rapist as well as the first person in a century to be expelled,” Hoenig said. Ward had held the seat of Kiama since 2011, first with the center-right Liberal Party and then as an independent after he quit the group when the charges against him emerged.

(Securite Civile via AP) VILLEROUGE LA CREMADE, France -- Firefighters and local authorities remained on high alert Friday after France’s largest wildfire in decades was contained in the south of the country, amid forecasts of very high temperatures which could reignite the blaze. Over three days, the fire spread across more than 160 square kilometers (62 square miles) in the Aude wine region and claimed one life, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes. In hot and dry weather, the blaze quickly spread with a perimeter reaching 90 kilometers and local authorities said they need to remain vigilant throughout the weekend as temperatures are expected to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) during another heat wave. Region administrator Christian Pouget said some 1,000 people have not yet been able to return to their homes after the fire swept through 15 communes in the Corbières mountain region, destroying or damaging at least 36 homes. “On Tuesday when the fire started, we learned that the inhabitants of the nearby village of Durban-Corbières were arriving in Tuchan," Beatrice Bertrand, the mayor of Tuchan, told The Associated Press.

Article: Lindsey Graham, shuttering his effort to oust the four-term incumbent after just more than a month and eschewing a “political climate that rewards deception over honesty, or ambition over unity.” In posts on social media, Bauer wrote Friday that he had decided to shutter his campaign “after deep prayer and reflection,” saying he believed “we must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.” He stopped short of endorsing any of the remaining candidates in the race to challenge Graham, who already has backing from President Donald Trump. In a pre-launch interview with The Associated Press, Bauer described himself as “a real, America First conservative” intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives’ true values, and he said “Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it.” Republicans dominate South Carolina’s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries. Graham — whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years — has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change. For this cycle, Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February and quickly secured Trump’s endorsement, and Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump’s 2024 bid, is serving as a senior adviser. At his 2024 campaign’s South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer, who served on his state leadership committee, “a friend of mine, somebody that could, I think, run for almost any office and win.” Bauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at age 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002.

Article: House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress. In an online post, Page wrote that state rules require the governor to issue a proclamation calling a statewide election at least 148 days before the date of the election — that would have been June 9. Page said if he waited for the Legislature and the governor to formally call the election, “it would be too late for me to actually conduct the election.” If it goes through, “We are going to make this work,” Page added.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: The Trump administration wants to end two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump's budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn't, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

(Azerbaijani Presidential Press Office via AP) WASHINGTON -- The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a peace deal Friday at the White House that could potentially put an end to decades of conflict, President Donald Trump said. to “pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.” “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,’” Trump wrote Thursday night on his Truth Social site. The prospective agreement could potentially put an end to decades of conflict and set the stage for a reopening of key transportation corridors across the South Caucasus that have been shut since the early 1990s. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreements included a major breakthrough establishing a key transit corridor across the region, which had been a hang-up in peace talks The agreement, according to the officials, would give the U.S. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fueled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years. When the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan. “Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine. The prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran. Turkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. “For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.

His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican plan for congressional redistricting are pleading for donations to help cover their costs After leaving Texas for Illinois to prevent a legislative vote on a Republican redistricting plan, state House Democratic leader Gene Wu needed a means to project his voice — and viewpoints — to a national audience. Now Texas Democrats are pleading for donations to help finance what could be a walkout of weeks — if not months — in a high-stakes attempt to prevent the Republican majority from passing a plan sought by President Donald Trump. “We’re getting a lot of small-dollar donations,” Wu told The Associated Press, "and that’s going to be used to help keep this thing going.” A political group led by Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, gave money to the Texas House Democratic Caucus to help cover the up-front costs, according to a spokesperson for the group, Powered by People. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said Wednesday he's launching an investigation into whether O'Rourke's group has committed bribery by a “financial influence scheme” benefiting Democrats who left Texas. Not only could Texas Democrats face thousands of dollars in out-of-state lodging and dining costs, they also could eventually face fines of $500 for each day they are absent, which under House rules cannot be paid from their office budgets or political contributions. Jose Menendez joined Democrats from other states at a rally in Boston, where he noted that the potential daily fine for quorum-breaking lawmakers is nearly as large as their entire monthly legislative salary. Some Democrats in the Texas Senate have traveled out of state this week to support their House colleagues, but lawmakers in that chamber are not leaving the state to hold up legislative business. We don’t have billionaires who are funding this operation.” The House Democratic Caucus has set up a website seeking donations of between $25 and $2,500 — with a default amount of $250. Earlier this week, Abbott asked the state's highest court to remove Wu from office and ordered the Texas Rangers to investigate possible bribery charges related to how Democrats are paying for the walkout, alleging anyone who financially helped them could be culpable. Before Democrats decided to leave Texas, Wu said he called potential allies for assurance “that there would be resources that would come to our assistance.” But he said that's no different from an aspiring candidate asking others for support before officially launching a campaign. Texas Democrats aren’t worried that they'll be forced to return home in the near future because of a lack of money, said Luke Warford, founder of Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund, a Texas fundraising and organizing group. But "when you think about it in the context of what Donald Trump has to gain and what Democrats might lose in the short term, it’s just not even close to the cost of trying to win back either these races or a bunch of other races in the country.” The Democratic lawmakers have been holed up at a hotel and conference center outside Chicago that was evacuated Wednesday after an unfounded bomb threat. "Our hotel bills seem so minor compared to what we’re trying to do — to protect democracy.” ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report.

Article: Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said the additional $600 million provided annually for Medicaid is hundreds of millions short and unless addressed would require reducing optional services, provider rates or both. “This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care," Stein said in a news release. “Despite these serious reservations, I am signing this bill into law because it keeps the lights on.” The new law does cover anticipated enrollment changes for K-12 schools and community colleges, as well as for experience-based pay raises already in state law for teachers. Stein's veto seeks to block a decision by North Carolina legislative leaders to join the tax-credit program contained in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill that he signed into law last month. The program provides starting in 2027 a one-to-one credit equal to up to $1,700 for those who donate to certain “scholarship granting organizations,” with those distributing K-12 private-school scholarships among them. The federal law said each state must opt in to the program, and North Carolina Republicans who have already greatly expanded state-funded scholarships wanted North Carolina to be the first to do so. Stein's veto message aligned with arguments by Democratic state legislators who voted against the state measure last week that the program shifts federal funding away from helping public schools and helps wealthy people who can already afford private school for their children. Stein said he would opt in to the program for the state once the federal government issued sound written guidance on program rules because he sees opportunities to “benefit North Carolina’s public school kids.” So, he added, the bill on his desk is “unnecessary.” The vetoed bill now returns to the General Assembly, where override votes could happen as early as Aug. Republicans are but one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority, and last week lawmakers were able to gain the Democratic support needed to override eight of Stein's 14 earlier vetoes. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said Wednesday that with the veto Stein is "attempting to usurp the General Assembly’s authority to set tax policy” and anticipated a veto override "to ensure North Carolina can participate in President Trump’s signature school choice initiative.” Stein also signed Wednesday legislation creating an expedited removal process for homeowners and landlords to remove people unauthorized to live on their property.

Article: As President Donald Trump pressures Republican states to reopen the process of redistricting mid cycle, Vice President JD Vance is set to meet with GOP leaders in Indiana FILE - U.S. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) Vice President JD Vance visits Indiana on Thursday to discuss redistricting with Republican leaders as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on GOP states to redraw congressional boundaries and give the party more winnable seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Vance's visit comes after Texas Democrats successfully stalled a vote there this week on a redrawn congressional map, part of a bid to secure five more GOP-leaning congressional seats at the expense of Democrats before the midterms. Indiana is staunchly Republican, but opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. But Indiana is also home to Mike Pence, the former vice president and a past governor whose more measured approach to partisan politics still holds sway among many state lawmakers. Frank Mrvan has been seen as a possible pickup in recent years as manufacturing union jobs have left the area, said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes that also gave a boost to the GOP in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. In a statement Tuesday, Mrvan said the Trump administration knows its policies are “wildly unpopular.” “They know that their only hope to maintain control is to pressure the Indiana General Assembly to violate the Indiana Constitution and redistrict U.S. Julia Vaughn, director of Common Cause Indiana, said a costly redistricting process will not look good for Republicans who tightened the belt on the state budget this past legislative session due to revenue forecasts. “I don’t think there is any way they could rationalize spending taxpayer dollars to come back to Indianapolis to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago for purely partisan purposes,” Vaughn said.

(Ramsey County Sheriff's Office via AP, File) MINNEAPOLIS -- The man charged with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. As they announced the indictment, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter’s federal defender, Manny Atwal, said at the time that the weighty charges did not come as a surprise, but she has not commented on the substance of the allegations or any defense strategies. "Accordingly, the discovery to be produced by the government will include a substantial amount of investigative material and reports from more than a dozen different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.” They said the evidence will include potentially thousands of hours of video footage, tens of thousands of pages of responses to dozens of grand jury subpoenas, and data from numerous electronic devices seized during the investigation. In a series of cryptic notes to The New York Times through his jail’s electronic messaging service, Boelter suggested his actions were partly rooted in the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbor. In messages published earlier by the New York Post, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate. He also reiterated that prosecutors consider Hortman's killing a “political assassination.” Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans’ home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin.

Article: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will hire as many as 450 people to shore up the National Weather Service after deep cuts this spring raised concern about dangerous understaffing After deep DOGE cuts, National Weather Service gets OK to fill up to 450 jobs The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will hire as many as 450 people to shore up the National Weather Service after deep cuts this spring raised concern about dangerous understaffing, the Trump administration confirmed Wednesday. After deadly flash flooding that killed dozens of people in Texas last month, some local officials and Democrats suggested that the deep staffing cuts may have contributed to endangering lives, though others defended the agency's work. “While this new development is great news for the NWS and the American public, I would like to see that the hiring actions are actually underway,” said Louis Uccellini, former NOAA administrator for weather services and NWS director. The hirings are said to include the “mission-critical field positions” that the agency announced it would hire for in June “to further stabilize front line operations." The agency did not say at the time how many roles would be filled.

Article: Thurmond announced his 2026 bid for the state's highest office Wednesday, saying he's “going to fight for the people of Georgia every day," but also pitching himself as someone who can bridge racial and political divides to become the first Democrat to win the state's top office in 28 years. the cost of groceries or rent or paying the mortgage, access to health care and quite frankly ending divisiveness that has prevented us from progressing more in this state.” The 72-year-old Thurmond joins a Democratic field that already includes state Sen. Before that, he was credited with stabilizing the DeKalb County school system as interim superintendent, after its accreditation agency threatened to strip its seal of approval, citing financial mismanagement, school board dysfunction and nepotism. Thurmond also oversaw welfare reform as director of Georgia's Division of Family and Children Services in the mid-1990s, after he gave up his state House seat to make an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1992. “I, throughout my career, never shied away from taking on tough jobs.” Both Bottoms and Esteves have showcased plans to oppose what they see as wrongheaded policies put forth by President Donald Trump, appealing to Democratic partisans who are fearful and angry. “I’m going to fight for Georgia residents.” Some Democrats are also calling for a generational turnover in leadership, a trend that's clearly apparent among the primary opponents of longtime U.S.

"I’m running to serve as Tennessee’s next governor to ensure Tennessee is America’s conservative leader."

Article: The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 60 years ago but has been slowly eroding for more than a decade The Voting Rights Act marks its 60th anniversary as its core provisions are being eroded North Dakota Democratic Rep. Jayme Davis poses for a photo in her office with a 2024 campaign sign on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at Turtle Mountain Administrative Offices on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color." The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1, saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect." The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill, but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

Article: House Several states consider redrawing congressional maps after Texas kicks off fight Empty chairs belonging to House Democrats remain empty during a session convocation in the State Capitol, Tuesday, Aug. But President Donald Trump's call for Texas to blatantly redraw the maps to better ensure that Republicans retain control of the House in the 2026 elections has blown the lid off of the practice. In response to events in Texas, Democrats in California are considering a draft proposal to reshape their own district maps and cut away five Republican seats while securing more precarious seats already held by Democrats. Kathy Hochul said if Texas proceeds, “we must do the same.” The proposal, however, would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the legislature twice and be approved by voters. The House Majority leader, David Moon, a Democrat, says he will sponsor legislation to trigger redistricting in Maryland if Texas or any other state holds redistricting ahead of the census. Ron DeSantis has said he was considering early redistricting and “working through what that would look like.” That's because a law in the Republican-led state requires it before the 2026 midterm elections. ____ Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

Article: colleges College endowment tax is leading to hiring freezes and could mean cuts in financial aid A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes. The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.” The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.” For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.

Article: The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months The entrance to a Boar's Head deli meat plant is seen in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar’s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. “The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,” officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday. And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar’s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. “If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize" for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.” But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. “You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. Rosa DeLauro called the findings “appalling.” “This is a pattern of negligence — cutting corners to protect the company’s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including “5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.” Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.

Article: “But after around 27,000 people visited the site one of my friends said to me, ‘You should do something more with this.’” Published in 2024, the resulting book-length edition of “Stephen King's Maine” is among hundreds released each year by The History Press. The mission of The History Press is to explore and unearth “the story of America, one town or community at a time.” The King book stands out if only for its focus on an international celebrity. Williams is a self-described “Western history writer” whose books include “Buffalo Soldiers on the Colorado Frontier” and “Haunted Hotels of Southern Colorado.” The History Press publishes highly specific works such as Jerry Harrington's tribute to a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor from the 1930s, “Crusading Iowa Journalist Verne Marshall.” It also issues various series, notably “Haunted” guides that publishing director Kate Jenkins calls a “highly localized version” of the ghost story genre. History Press has long recruited potential authors through a team of field representatives, but now writers such as Kitchens are as likely to be brought to the publisher's attention through a national network of writers who have worked with it before. “Our ideal author isn’t someone with national reach,” Jenkins says, “but someone who’s a member of their community, whether that’s an ethnic community or a local community, and is passionate about preserving that community’s history. Editions selling 15,000 copies or more include “Long-Ago Stories of the Eastern Cherokee,” by Lloyd Arneach, Alphonso Brown's “A Gullah Guide to Charleston” and Gayle Soucek's “Marshall Field's,” a tribute to the Chicago department store. The King guide, which has sold around 8,500 copies so far, received an unexpected lift — an endorsement by its subject, who was shown the book at Maine's Bridgton Books and posted an Instagram of himself giving it a thumbs-up. “Every choice I made while writing the book, I made with him in mind.” History Press authors say they like the chance to tell stories that they believe haven’t been heard, or were told incorrectly. Rory O'Neill Schmitt is an Arizona-based researcher, lecturer and writer who feels her native New Orleans is often “portrayed in way that feels false or highlights a touristy element,” like a “caricature.” She has responded with such books as “The Haunted Guide to New Orleans” and “Kate Chopin in New Orleans.” Brianne Turczynski is a freelance writer and self-described “perpetual seeker of the human condition” who lives outside of Detroit and has an acknowledged obsession with “Poletown,” a Polish ethnic community uprooted and dismantled in the 1980s after General Motors decided to build a new plant there and successfully asserted eminent domain. In 2021, The History Press released Turczynski's “Detroit’s Lost Poletown: The Little Neighborhood That Touched a Nation.” “All of the journalist work that followed the story seemed to lack a sense of closure for the people who suffered,” she said. “So my book is a love letter to that community, an attempt for closure.” Kitchens has followed her King book with the story of an unsolved homicide, “The Murder of Dorothy Milliken, Cold Case in Maine.” One of her early boosters, Michelle Souliere, is the owner of the Green Hand Bookstore in Portland and herself a History Press writer.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

At the retail level, Toyota sold 2.4 million vehicles globally, with sales growing in Japan, North America and Europe from the previous year, when global retail totaled 2.2 million vehicles. The models to be produced there are still undecided, but the plant will be part of the company's plan to maintain a production capacity of 3 million vehicles in Japan, according to Toyota.

(AP Photo, File) FILE - In this image taken from video, President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera arrives at a polling station in Bangui, Central African Republic, Sunday, July 30, 2023. (AP Photo, File) BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow's state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic's government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow's demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). "Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Article: Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries. Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program “broken” and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of “inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Kennedy didn’t specify the changes he's seeking. In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program “has taken a hard line” against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to “a nondependent, adult son," according to his financial disclosures. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children’s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm — perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned — and add the condition to the program. The group’s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son’s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

Article: Honda has reported its profit in the last quarter was half of what it was a year earlier, as automakers were hit by 25% tariffs on vehicle exports to the United States TOKYO -- Honda's profit in the last quarter was half of what it was a year earlier, the company said Wednesday, as automakers were hit by 25% tariffs on vehicle exports to the United States. The Japanese automaker reported Wednesday that its April-June profit totaled 196.7 billion yen ($1.3 billion), about half of what it earned during the same period the previous year at 394.7 billion yen. The Tokyo-based maker of the Accord sedan and Asimo robot revised upward its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2026 to 420 billion yen ($2.9 billion), better than its earlier estimate of 250 billion yen. Fujimura stressed that Honda has long tried to promote free trade and fair competition around the world to deliver quality products and, in his words, “contribute to the local community.” “Now we must face up to this new normal,” he told reporters.

But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. These producers "probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio opens a liquid nitrogen freezer used to store blood samples used for research at the university's T.H. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration. You're being cut off.'” The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus," the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. "It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day." John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. When a friend asked what she was planning for Thursday, she wrote: “on Thursday we kill all the Mexico’s.” Mathis said the comments were “wrong” and “stupid,” but context showed they were not a threat. “And it was this stupid, stupid technology that is just going through picking up random words and not looking at context.” Surveillance systems in American schools increasingly monitor everything students write on school accounts and devices. The 13-year-old girl arrested in August 2023 had been texting with friends on a chat function tied to her school email at Fairview Middle School, which uses Gaggle to monitor students' accounts. The school district did not respond to a request for comment.) Taken to jail, the teen was interrogated and strip-searched, and her parents weren't allowed to talk to her until the next day, according to a lawsuit they filed against the school system. Amy Bennett, chief of staff for Lightspeed Systems, said that the software helps understaffed schools “be proactive rather than punitive” by identifying early warning signs of bullying, self-harm, violence or abuse. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others. “A really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience — not something that helps them with their mental health care,” said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues — including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students’ Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. Natasha Torkzaban, who graduated in 2024, said she was flagged for editing a friend’s college essay because it had the words “mental health.” “I think ideally we wouldn’t stick a new and shiny solution of AI on a deep-rooted issue of teenage mental health and the suicide rates in America, but that’s where we’re at right now,” Torkzaban said. She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.

Article: For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it “easy prey for pedophiles.” Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that “no system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.” The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though — as with most moderation rules — people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards. It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission — and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them. "But when you’re thinking about things related to child endangerment or grooming, the types of behaviors you’re looking at manifest over a very long period of time.” Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox — about 6 billion messages per day — and analyzes them for potential harms. “It doesn’t happen on one message because you just send one message, but it happens because of all of your days' interactions are leading towards one of these two,” Koneru said. “Then we say, okay, maybe this user is somebody who we need to take a much closer look at, and then we go pull all of their other conversations, other friends, and the games that they played, and all of those things.” Humans review risky interactions and flag to law enforcement accordingly.

Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

(Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute via AP) WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic. The findings “solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean," said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study. Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study. “It’s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,” said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was “really smart and significant.” Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. “They’re voracious eaters.” With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population – and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations -- and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to “the rainforests of the ocean.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

(AP Photo/Louise Delmotte) HIROSHIMA, Japan -- When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Ari Beser’s grandfather was on board both of the American B-29 bombers that carried the weapons. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers’ linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States. During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences. When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: “I wouldn’t say it was our proudest moment.” He said the world needed to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Beser, who was in the back of the aircraft working as a radar specialist, said that all he saw out of the window was a “boiling muddy mess with fires continuing to break out on the periphery.” Three days later, he was in another bomber, Bockscar, above Yamaguchi's hometown. “For me, all I focus on is trying to convey it to people so that it doesn’t happen again." Because his grandfather was on both B-29s, Ari Beser was always interested in meeting a double survivor. Everybody needs hope and this is how I get hope." ___ This story has been corrected to show that the the spelling of the second bomber is Bockscar, not Bochscar.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic — and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis. Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to “make enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world," said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.

Patz called the finding “an important new contribution.” Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution. There are lots of components of wildfire smoke.” She said the study suggests “this toxicity is affecting people's long-term lung function.” Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Article: An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started Anti-death penalty demonstrators gather outside Riverbend Maximum Security Institution before the execution of Byron Black Tuesday, Aug. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was “hurting so bad” while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered. Asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it's hurting so bad," Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm. “Today, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could," attorney Kelley Henry said. “The fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,” Henry said. Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

Article: The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is “highly effective” and “considered to be of major public health interest.” Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. UNAIDS chief Byanyima has previously suggested that President Donald Trump make a deal with Gilead to produce and license its “magical” prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.

Article: DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car. The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards. Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon. The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035. But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. “With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement. Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits. Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.” It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years.

Article: West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class In this image from video, a student eats a meatball sub sandwich during lunch in Parkersburg, W.Va., on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. “Where do we start?” Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, “but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.” More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects. Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. “In rural West Virginia, I don’t think it’s really on radar screens.” In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was “really good.” Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: “Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Article: Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful “forever chemicals” years before the federal government acted. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan — among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases. The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state’s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said. John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules. And what we’ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they’ve elected not to.” Mobile home parks without a license are “essentially operating unregulated,” Cherry said. A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 — new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though “the problem is, I’m not resourced for that.” The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year’s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable.

(AP Photo/Emily Elconin) Trinity Wilson, 12, holds her five-month-old cousin, Jaylen, as she and her family walk around the Flint Rx Kids Baby Parade event on July 25, 2025 in on Applewood Campus in Flint, Michigan. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played. It was called a “baby parade.” The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump’s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate. Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up. “They are helping us prove that this is possible.” Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. “And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.” A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate. But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care — not just the number of babies being born here. “No wonder people aren’t having children and our birth rates are going down.” The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 “baby bonuses,” a policy similar to Rx Kids.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump. Vinay Prasad “did not want to be a distraction” and was stepping down from his role as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator “to spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday. Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA’s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines. Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder. During Trump’s first term he signed the “ Right to Try ” law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.

(AP Photo/Farah Abdi Warsameh, File) KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion — some two-thirds of the continent's population — in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don’t reach that mark, the report said. An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that “contrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa” and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said. According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks — in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance — were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 “hunger hot spots.” That report, by FAO and WFP, mentioned Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories as being of the “highest concern level.” Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen were classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people faced or were projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is “concerning,” driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.

Article: A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died 'Chimp Crazy' star sentenced to nearly 4 years in prison for lying that primate died A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died. It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in “confined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures” at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility. Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies “Buddy” and “George of the Jungle.” Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie “Buddy” alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2022 that she lied to protect Tonka from “the evil clutches of PETA.” She also admitted what happened in the third episode of “Chimp Crazy,” which premiered last year, saying, “Tonka was literally on the run with me.” Just last month, investigators found another chimp locked up in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach in violation of court orders, documents in the case said. "In the face of these harsh realities threaded throughout her life, Haddix came to form secure attachments with animals.” PETA praised the sentence in a news release, saying that Haddix now “can't hurt another chimpanzee.”

Article: As Starz's historical drama series “Outlander” readies its final season for a premiere next year, fans can now learn about where Jamie and Claire Fraser came from in the new prequel series, “Outlander: Blood of My Blood.” 'Outlander' prequel series 'Blood of My Blood' goes back in time again — to meet the parents Hermione Corfield poses for a portrait to promote "Outlander: Blood of My Blood" during Comic-Con International on Saturday, July 26, 2025, in San Diego. In “Outlander,” "there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that’s what our audience wants from the books.” In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in “breadcrumbs” said Roberts. “We stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.” The big obstacle facing Jamie’s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland — is that they come from families that “don’t get on,” said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. My father’s worst enemy was Brian’s father so I’m sure he’d have had some strong words to say about the whole thing.” Jamie Roy, who plays Brian, enjoys the duality of his character. There's the “tough, stoic, Highland warrior” who he says “rides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.” Then there's this “lovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.” A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of “Outlander,” because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son. “I think he’s accepted death really and doesn’t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.” Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. They end up in the 1700s where Irvine explains they are “trying to live second by second.” "The time they’ve gone back to is not a friendly time to be an outsider at all. They survive by the skin of their teeth.” The cast is already in production on season two of “Blood of My Blood.” Hermione Corfield, who plays Julia, says it's been nice filming “in our own little secret bubble.” Promoting the series has been tricky because they have to remember what happened in season one versus season two.

Article: The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn’s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically Gwen Davis sings at Berean Baptist Church in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York, Thursday, July 31, 2025. (Fiona Murphy/Religion News Service via AP) NEW YORK (RNS) — On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand‑claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard “God Is” on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as “joy in sorrow” and “strength for tomorrow.” Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.' As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,” said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she’s been a congregant for six years. “I really feel sometimes like it’s not just me singing, it’s my lineage singing.” ___ This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center. Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today. “I don’t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.” According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% — the largest decline among major U.S. Glenn McMillan, Concord’s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish. “In the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,” McMillan said. According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in‑person worship. “People don’t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.” McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid‑1960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song. A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.” During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods. Augustine said singing is praying twice.” Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. “We only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, no — we can’t let this happen.’” Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. "When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,” Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. “At the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other’s pain and celebrate each other’s joys.” McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. “A choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.” Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.

Article: Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre” at the Santa Fe Opera House This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. (Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

Article: But it’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work. It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I’ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she’s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto). Miller’s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest “Dame Of Darkness” is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. There’s lots of fretting over why Katherine won’t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. But coherency of the vision is limited, as is the audience’s investment, though there are some lovely and inspired touches like using Iranian artist Reza Riahi to hand paint several animated flashback vignettes based on her memories of her fathers. Thomas co-wrote the script with her husband, journalist John Micklethwait, which includes a particularly poignant monologue for her character telling her daughters, essentially, to grow up and move on — a mature and worthy statement that might come a bit too late. But Thomas did have the good sense to end with a song that might just conjure up some feelings for any “Heartburn” fans out there: Carly Simon’s “Coming Around Again,” this time a duet with Alanis Morissette.

Article: Eddie Palmieri, the pioneering rumba and Latin jazz musician, has died at 88 Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. Palmieri’s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after “an extended illness.” The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle’s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums. His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album “The Sun of Latin Music,” and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams. In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: “Learning to play the piano well. Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of “Harlem River Drive,” in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production “Llegó La India vía Eddie Palmieri.” Palmieri released the album “Masterpiece” in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) LOS ANGELES -- If there’s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie “Weapons,” it’s that the best laughs won’t come from the jokes he writes. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious — a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie’s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are “opposite side of the same coin.” “It’s funny because this isn’t even like a proper horror film,” Garner said. “It has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it’s kind of its own genre, in a way.” The town’s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Yet, when Garner’s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage. “We definitely have a, ‘Whoa, not my problem,’ kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we’re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it’s happening in front of us,” Cregger said. “Living in America, I’ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I’ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don’t know, it feels real.” Brolin — who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, “The Goonies,” to the Marvel universe — initially hesitated when approached for the film. How do you deal?” For Ehrenreich, who’s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, “Weapons” offered a different pace, but its horror wasn’t what drew him in. “The weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I’ve read in years,” Ehrenreich said.

Simon, an appointee of President Barack Obama, issued a temporary stay on action taken in April by the National Endowment for the Humanities, saying the claims made by plaintiffs in the case were “likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this case is unconstitutional.” Defendants’ conduct reflects a “deliberate decision to flout Congressional command and refuse to spend appropriated funds,” the opinion said, noting, “The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.” The Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled dozens of grants to state and local humanities' councils in April as part of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts. This is one step — among many that are needed — in the large, ongoing endeavor to knit our communities and the country closer together.” The National Endowment for the Humanities did not immediately answer a phone call or email for comment. Simon said in issuing the stay that the record contained “unrebutted evidence of irreparable harms," noting that “when these programs are cancelled, there can be no do over and no redress.“ The judge rejected a request by the NEH that the injunction be stayed. Simon said the defendants were “likely violating statutory obligations and principles of separation of powers that have existed for decades.” The order also stopped the government from “disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs.”

Article: The chief weakness of “Freakier Friday” — which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion — is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. I’ll admit to laughing out loud — with everyone else older than 30 near me — when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: “It’s like a database of old people!” Touché, guys. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.) Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is “Rebelling with Respect.” Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out “Make good choices!” — just what mom Tess used to say, natch. “Freakier Friday,” a Walt Disney Studios release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association “for thematic elements, rude humor, language and some suggestive references.” Running time: 111 minutes.

Bogard is known for radio staples like George Strait's “Carried Away,” Rascal Flatts' “Prayin’ For Daylight” and Dierks Bentley's “Every Mile A Memory.” Martin also wrote for Strait — “Baby’s Gotten Good At Goodbye” — as well as Jason Aldean (“A Little More Summertime”) and Keith Urban (“You Look Good In My Shirt”). Lauderdale is known for his own songs, like “I Feel Like Singing Today,” “She’s Looking At Me” and “Mighty Lonesome,” but also those he wrote for others, like Mark Chesnutt's “Gonna Get A Life” and Patty Loveless' “Halfway Down.” Cook is notable for T. Graham Brown's “I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again,” Steve Wariner's “Small Town Girl” and Brooks & Dunn's “Only In America.” The chair of the organization’s board of directors, Rich Hallworth, and Mark Ford, its executive director, made the announcement at Nashville’s historic Columbia Studio A. “Gathering as we do each year — to reveal and welcome the members of our incoming class — is truly one of the highlights of our calendar,” Hallworth said in a statement.

Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall." James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. "It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost.

(AP Photo/Peter Kemp, File) FILE - Mick Jagger, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones perform before a crowd of nearly 250,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, on July 5, 1969, during a five hour concert. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next.

Article: Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, “Different Night Same Rodeo.” “I don't know what I'm doing,” Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. “I just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I’m trying to write other songs that have already been written.” So, he took a step back, and asked himself: “What am I trying to do with my music? “So just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I’ve been through.” On “Different Night Same Rodeo,” those stories are told in big-hearted ballads (“Hell or High Water”), good time stomps (“New to Country”) and varied collaborations, including with country star Luke Combs (“Backup Plan”), the rising pop voice the Kid LAROI (“Lost”), and Diplo (“Ashes”). He's always been open to such eclectic collaborations, anchored in his raspy, charismatic tone — Zimmerman's highest charting song to date is “All The Way,” a hip-hop-country hybrid he features on with rapper BigXThaPlug. “And I want it to feel real, because it comes across not real when it’s not.” For an artist who describes himself as “dealing with a little bit of impostor syndrome,” he seems to know, at least intuitively, what works for himself and his fans.

Article: "The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska," Trump said in a Truth Social post. Trump had pledged "secondary tariffs" of "about 100%" on Russia's trade partners, if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, setting an initial 50-day timeline that was later shortened. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a key foreign policy objective of his second presidential mandate, reversing course on an initial thawing of White House relations with Moscow to now pile on pressure on the Kremlin for the lull in diplomatic progress. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travelled for an eleventh-hour meeting with Putin, which Trump hailed as "highly productive." "Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come," he said Wednesday. "At the President's direction, Special Envoy Witkoff once again met with President Putin to discuss potential paths to peace, and the President and his national security team are discussing those paths with both the Ukrainians and the Europeans," Leavitt said. "Out of respect for our sensitive diplomatic discussions with Russia, Ukraine, and our European allies, the White House will not comment on alleged details in the news media." Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an X post that he thought the U.S. At the heart of Russia and Ukraine's inability to strike a ceasefire to date have been differences over Putin's maximalist demands that the war can only end if Kyiv gives up its ambitions to join the NATO military alliance and if Moscow retains four Ukrainian regions annexed during the latest conflict. Very disappointed." Secondary tariffs At risk for Russia is the potential dissolution of its scant remaining client base for its crude and oil products volumes, which countries within the G7 are no longer permitted to take on a seaborne basis. Under a G7 scheme, nations outside of the coalition retain critical access to Western shipping and insurance mechanisms as long as they only purchase Russian supplies under a price cap. Russia's sanctions-sapped economy heavily depends on its crude sales, amid increasing isolation on the international stage and dwindling growth expected near 1.4% this year, from 4.3% in 2024, according to the World Bank's June forecasts.

Article: Kate Green | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images "Treatonomics" — a consumer trend that covers spending on 'everyday luxuries' to larger, life-affirming experiences — is booming as people look for a mood boost in ongoing unsettling economic times. Spending on small-item 'pick-me-ups' is a well-established recession-resistant trend, with consumers often turning to purchases of modest personal items such as make-up, perfume and candles — or even collectible rubber ducks or Labubu dolls — for a morale boost when times are hard or uncertain. First documented during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the term had a renaissance in the 2000s when Leonard Lauder, former chairman of makeup brand Estée Lauder, noticed a spike in sales after the Sept. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth," he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is "much more resilient than people imagine." SHANGHAI, CHINA: A woman checks out the lipsticks at a department store in Shanghai, 16 August 2004. LIU JIN | AFP | Getty Images The Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have "experiences," particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour. "Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330)," Stevenson said. "This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life," Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times." Smith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for "nearly every living generation" and were being reinvented or disappearing, "out of desire or because they're no longer attainable." That has prompted a shift from being able to celebrate 'milestones' to celebrating more 'inch-stones,' resulting in this rapid rise of treatonomics. "For example — for those who can't afford a home before 40, treating has been a welcome respite and a way to express themselves in their environment when a milestone passes them by," Smith said. Urbazon | E+ | Getty Images On a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has "catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits," Smith added. Consumer confidence underlies the mood In the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued "below last year's heady levels," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week.

The Trade Desk, which specializes in providing technology to companies that want to target users across the web, said finance chief Laura Schenkein is leaving the job and being replaced by Alex Kayyal, who has been working as a partner at Lightspeed Ventures. While some analysts were uneasy about the sudden change in the top finance role, the bigger concern is Amazon's growing role in the online ad market, as well as the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on ad spending. "Amazon is now unlocking access to traditionally exclusive 'premium' ad inventory across the open internet, validating the strength of its DSP and suggesting The Trade Desk's value proposition could erode over time," Wedbush analysts wrote on Friday. The Wedbush analysts lowered their rating on The Trade Desk to the equivalent of hold from buy, and cited Amazon's recent ad integration with Disney as a sign of the company's aggressiveness. Executives at The Trade Desk were asked about Amazon on the call, and responded by suggesting that the companies don't really compete, emphasizing that Amazon is conflicted because it will always prioritize its own properties. watch now "A scaled independent DSP like The Trade Desk becomes essential as we help advertisers buy across everything and that we have to do that without conflict or compromise," CEO Jeff Green said on the call. That creates a number of conflicts." For the second quarter, The Trade Desk reported a 19% increase in year-over-year revenue to $694 million, topping the $685 million estimate, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Many are managing inflation worries and the related pricing that comes with that." With Friday's slump, The Trade Desk shares are now down 54% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up about 9%.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC this week that the Supreme Court could end up disqualifying the duties that have been ordered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act enacted by Congress in 1977. "If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy," Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. However, Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a report this week that these levies being struck down would lead to a "massive amount of red tape" around who would receive refunds. Markets this year have appeared to respond positively whenever the White House has dialed back on tariffs, and have reacted negatively when Trump has pressed the case for higher duties on imports to the U.S. For example, when Trump suspended the initial "liberation day" tariffs in early April for the next 90 days, the Nasdaq Composite soared 7% in just a few minutes, with other major market averages also posting large gains that week. Companies such as AMD and Marvell , as well as Apple , then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add manufacturing in the U.S.

Article: President Donald Trump 's new executive order paves the way to bring alternative assets into 401(k)s, but what that will eventually look like — and how complicated it may be — remains to be seen. The order, signed by the president on Thursday , directs the Secretary of Labor to reexamine fiduciary guidance on alternative investments — such as private equity, private credit and cryptocurrencies — in 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans. "There's still a very big question if plan sponsors will actually get comfortable enough to make these an option." Some $12.2 trillion was held in defined contributions plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, as of the end of the first quarter, according to the Investment Company Institute . One size doesn't always fit Bonnie Treichel, an attorney who specializes in ERISA, believes it is inevitable that assets such as private equity, private credit, hedge funds, real estate and cryptocurrencies are coming to the defined contribution market. "The plan sponsors' job is to offer an investment lineup that is in the best interest of the plan and its participants, and that meets the needs of those participants," said Treichel, founder of Endeavor Retirement. "It's not a one-size-fits all when it comes to retirement plans." Treichel doesn't see alternative assets becoming available as a standalone investment option in a 401(k), at least just yet. That hedge fund is going to be within a target date fund, so a participant is not necessarily choosing how much they allocate to a hedge fund or private credit." Part of the whole Prime Capital Financial's Jania Stout, president of the firm's retirement and wellness businesses, also anticipates the options are likely to be inside a target date fund, with a small percentage allocated to private markets, or managed accounts. "I don't think we're there yet." Morningstar's Kephart believes that first offering the investments in managed accounts, which investors often have to opt into, will make plan sponsors more comfortable, he said. "It brings the question of — at the end of the day, is it worth it if you have to take all these extra steps to make it fit?" Higher fees Adding exposure to alternative assets could also cost you more money. "What we've seen in private market funds is the incentive fee expense is usually at least as high as the management fee, if not higher." For instance, a lot of index-based target-date funds have expense ratios of 0.10% or lower, he said. If a plan ultimately offers some form of alternative asset allocation and investors aren't interested, they can talk to the advisors associated with the plan about other investment options, Treichel said. And that's what committees have to decide when they're evaluating this at their fiduciary committee meetings." Encouraging guardrails Certified financial planner Chuck Failla, founder of Sovereign Financial Group, thinks 401(k)s should have some type of guardrails in place to ensure those investing in private markets are accredited investors, which means they have a net worth of at least $1 million. "If you don't have a $1 million liquid, you should probably stay away from alts until you have some more liquidity backed up," said Failla, who offers private market access to his mass affluent clients through a fund. For instance, if plan sponsors try to limit the risks that inherently come with investing in the space, it could ultimately affect the investments' returns, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. "One of the reasons that private market' return is so much better is because you get compensated by giving your money away for an extended period of time where you can't get it back," Roth explained.

Article: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call that AI helped imbue "greater efficiency and gains across our ad system," thus contributing to the 22% year-over-year increase of second-quarter sales that hit $47.52 billion. In April, Li noted that Asia-based online retailers pulled back on their digital ad spending amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tough tariffs and the closing of the de minimis trade loophole. This quarter, Li said there's been a noticeable "improvement" with those Asian-based ecommerce firms, which have increased their digital ad spending on the platform along with small, North American-based advertisers. Davidson, said that while there is still broader macroeconomic uncertainty, "today, digital advertising in general, is doing well; It is simply an extension of the fact that the consumer is still strong." "There's optimism that consumer spending will hold up and therefore all the downstream markets will hold up," Luria said. "I think one of the things that its earnings taught us was that you can spend a lot of money on AI when your core business is doing well, and especially when your core business has been already benefiting from the investments that you've made in AI," Jasmine Enberg, a vice president and principal analyst for eMarketer, said about Meta's second quarter. Alphabet added an extra $10 billion to its 2025 forecast for capital expenditures, now pegged at $85 billion, while Meta raised the low end of its capital expenditures for the year to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion instead of $64 billion and $72 billion. "They kind of rose back like a phoenix and had some extraordinary results," Luria said about Reddit, which saw its shares plummet over 15% in February after it reported weaker-than-expected user numbers due to a Google search algorithm change. Snap's second-quarter sales grew only 9% year-over-year and it missed Wall Street's estimates on global average revenue per user, a metric that refers to how much money the company derives from each user. Pinterest finance chief Julia Brau Donnelly told analysts during an earnings call that the company is still noticing some tariff-related concerns, "and broader market uncertainty" as it previously indicated in May. Unlike Meta, Donnelly said that "Asia-based e-commerce retailers pulled back spend in the U.S.," underscoring how some advertisers gravitate toward bigger online ad platforms amid any signs of global economic uncertainty.

Article: President Donald Trump on Friday removed Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Billy Long and is replacing him temporarily with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, three sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. The temporary appointment adds to Bessent's long list of tasks such as managing trade talks with China, Canada and Mexico as well as other countries that are still trying to negotiate tariff rates. Trump has long promised to set up an "external revenue service" for collecting those tariff revenues but the task still falls to the Treasury Department and Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The law extends the expiring tax cuts he enacted in his first term, in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay and allowing deductions on auto loan interest payments. The legislation is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over 10 years and lead to more than 11 million people losing health insurance coverage due to Medicaid cuts and other provisions.

Article: The bankrupt home goods chain is being resurrected by the owners and licensees of its intellectual property, which opened the first new Bed Bath & Beyond store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday with potentially dozens of more to come. This time around, the store has a new name — Bed Bath & Beyond Home — and marks a "fresh start" for the beloved brand, said Amy Sullivan, the CEO of The Brand House Collective , the store's operator. "We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today," Sullivan said in a news release. It's a powerful addition to our portfolio and a meaningful step forward in our transformation." In honor of the brand's legacy, the new store will accept the brand's famous 20% coupon, regardless of when it expired. "The coupon we all know and love is back and for those who need one, a fresh version will be waiting at the door." Bed Bath and Beyond 2.0 has been several years in the making and involved a rigmarole of corporate acquisitions and rebrandings. When the original Bed Bath and Beyond filed for bankruptcy in April 2023 following a string of corporate missteps, it struggled to find a buyer and ended up liquidating and selling off its business in parts. Ultimately, Beyond took an ownership stake in Kirkland's Inc., a home decor chain with around 300 stores across the U.S., and gave it the exclusive license to develop and create Bed Bath & Beyond Home stores, as well as Buy Buy Baby stores. The company said it chose Nashville for the launch because of its proximity to its corporate headquarters, which will allow it to "closely manage every detail and set the standard for future rollouts." While the relaunch is exciting for fans of the legacy brand, it comes at a difficult time for the home decor market. In many ways, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy was the fault of its management team and execution missteps, but it also faced macro challenges as well, experts said at the time. Competition from players like Amazon , Walmart , Home Goods and Wayfair has made it harder for other brands to capture customer spend, and the overall sector has been soft for several years because of high interest rates and the sluggish housing market.

Article: The Israeli military "will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement early Friday after a Cabinet meeting that ran late into the night. The plan envisions the disarming of Hamas, which has run the enclave since 2007, the return of all the hostages, and the demilitarization of the entire Gaza Strip and Israeli control of it. NBC News reported earlier that commercial satellite images showed the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave. Last week, the world's leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, sounded the alarm that the "worst-case scenario of famine" was now unfolding in Gaza under Israel's deadly military offensive and crippling aid restrictions.

Article: President Donald Trump (C), Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (L), and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan (R) hold up an agreement signed during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on August 8, 2025 in Washington, DC. The deal between the South Caucasus rivals - assuming it holds - would be a significant accomplishment for the Trump administration that is sure to rattle Moscow, which sees the region as within its sphere of influence. "It's a long time - 35 years - they fought and now they're friends, and they're going to be friends for a long time," Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House, where he was flanked by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan and India. Senior administration officials told reporters the agreement marked the first end to several frozen conflicts on Russia's periphery since the end of the Cold War and said it would send a powerful signal to the entire region. The peace deal could transform the South Caucasus, an energy-producing region neighboring Russia, Europe, Turkey and Iran that is criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines but riven by closed borders and longstanding ethnic conflicts. Daphne Panayotatos, with the Washington-based rights group Freedom Now, said it has urged the Trump administration to use the meeting with Aliyev to demand the release of some 375 political prisoners held in the country.

Article: Sweetgreen shares dropped 23% on Friday after the salad chain cut its 2025 outlook for the second quarter in a row, citing issues with its loyalty program, weak consumer sentiment, tariff headwinds and store challenges. For the full-year 2025, Sweetgreen now expects revenue of between $700 million and $715 million, down from its May prediction of $740 million to $760 million and its February outlook of $760 million to $780 million. On a Thursday call with analysts, CEO Jonathan Neman said Sweetgreen had a "really, really rough quarter." He said both external headwinds and internal actions played a role in the performance, including "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April, lapping a tough comparison with last year's successful steak launch and the transition of our new loyalty program at the beginning of the quarter." The company reported a second-quarter earnings and revenue miss, reporting a loss of 20 cents per share versus a loss of 12 cents expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG. Neman told investors on Thursday that only one-third of restaurants are performing at or above standards, while the remaining two-thirds "represent a meaningful opportunity for improvement." He said the company is aiming to improve operations through the leadership of its new chief operating officer, Jason Cochran, and the launch of a new program called Project One Best Way, focused on improving speed and food standards and increasing portion sizes.

The key indexes stayed out of danger by hiding behind their big brothers, the Nasdaq giants that embody both defense and aggression in this bull market. Apple 's jailbreak rally extended for a third day, the big Mag 7 laggard trying to make it up in a hurry, while carrying the Nasdaq-100 to a fresh high and offsetting another cluster of post-earnings selloffs in individual stocks (today it was Trade Desk , Microchip Tech and Block ). For the week, the NDX was up some 3.7%, almost three percentage points ahead of the equal-weight S & P 500 , enabling the standard-weight S & P 500 to hold within 1% of last week's intraday peak. Over the course of the week, acute concern over last Friday's poor employment report and broader apprehension toward the volatility-prone month of August was salved by increasing expectations of a September Fed rate cut, a glass-half-full take on new tariffs that emphasizes the room for exemptions and a broader sense that the brute force of the AI-buildout theme is too tough to fight. The S & P 500 is at levels first reached two weeks ago, in a healthy uptrend, with widely acknowledged likely support around 6150, both the old February peak and around the 50-day moving average – less than a 4% drop from here.

Article: In this article .FKRX300 Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Ryu Young-sang, CEO of South Korean telecoms giant SK Telecom, told CNBC that AI is helping telecoms firms improve efficiency in their networks. Manaure Quintero | Afp | Getty Images South Korea has tasked some of its biggest companies and promising startups to build a national foundational AI model using mainly domestic technology, in a rare move to keep the country apace with the U.S. The project will feature South Korean technologies from semiconductors to software, as Seoul looks to create a near self-sufficient AI industry and position itself as an alternative to China and the U.S. "The country aims to combine its dominance in memory chip production with the development of indigenous AI." The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) for Korea announced that five consortia have been selected to develop the models. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness," Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC. "This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents," The Futurum Group's Patience said. Meanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon . The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called "A." which is pronounced "A dot." Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot. Any AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek. "Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic," Kim told CNBC. An open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.

Carter, a defender for the American soccer team Gotham FC, is part of the England women's national team, nicknamed the "Lionesses," that just secured a historic win in the Euro 2025 championships after defeating Spain on penalties in the final in Switzerland in July. Carter had to take a step back from social media after facing intense racial abuse during the tournament and in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer, she shared how she's dealing with the online attacks. "I'm not someone who normally takes myself off social media, because I'm used to the critics and used to getting some of the abuse that we get as athletes and people in the public eye, as it happens a lot," Carter told Bryer. "So this time around, I think the way that I dealt with it was just to completely take myself off social media so that I wasn't able to see anything that was said and I could just focus on what was being said within my camp," she added. The England women's team came out in support of Carter after the abuse and decided not to take the knee — an anti-racism gesture — before the Euro 2025 matches, saying it is "clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism."

Article: President Donald Trump's latest tariffs, a sharp departure from the steep selloff triggered by his April 2 announcement of "reciprocal" duties, as investors grow increasingly numb to what they see as a negotiating tactic. India, targeted in part over its continued purchases of Russian oil, saw its tariffs jump from an earlier 25% to 50% on Wednesday on a broad range of goods . I think there's also a lot of precedent in terms of things being announced and then rolled back later," said Steve Brice, global chief investment officer at Standard Chartered Bank's wealth solutions unit. Investors' indifference towards Trump's tariff threats recalls a term for his pattern of announcing hefty tariff threats that jolt markets, only to scale them back or delay them, which was coined as "Trump Always Chickens Out" — or TACO . The markets bought into Trump's rhetoric in April when he said that his initial tariff positions were his final offer, which explains why equity markets fell heavily, said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds. "I think the markets are becoming a bit numb to the permanent volatility on these issues," he said, adding that markets attempted to price these in back in April and May, but pauses and repeated negotiations since then have made the markets "incapable of pricing it in any concrete manner." "The market is just not capable of pricing it in because of the chronic uncertainty," he said. On Wednesday, Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States."

Article: David Mcnew | Getty Images News | Getty Images Top insurers fear the climate crisis could soon outpace industry solutions, effectively threatening to make entire regions around the world uninsurable. Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz , one of the world's biggest insurers, recently outlined how the world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for financial services, such as mortgages and investments. In a LinkedIn post published in late March, Thallinger made the case for rapid decarbonization, pointing out that entire asset classes were "degrading in real time" as extreme weather events take their toll. Thallinger, who is responsible for investment management and sustainability at Allianz, told CNBC that approximately two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are currently uninsured, indicating a "major societal problem." We are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. "If this volume just grows even more, we simply have a societal situation that is not bearable anymore because it is just too much risk that is no longer covered," Thallinger told CNBC by video call. It's very, very difficult to deal with these assets as an investor." The warning comes at a time when the world is on course for a temperature increase of as much as 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century, according to the United Nations, a level that would trigger "catastrophic" consequences for the planet. Allianz estimates that the cost of economic losses from natural catastrophes is typically around 10 times higher than the cost of adaptation, noting that this provides a clear economic incentive for policymakers to invest in preventative measures. "If we continue, however, with the policies that we have out there, we are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. Zurich Insurance Group , Europe's fifth-largest insurer, said in April alongside a research paper assessing climate resilience that the outlook looks "alarmingly bleak." The Swiss insurer cited the Los Angeles wildfires at the start of the year as a stark reminder that even the world's wealthiest economies are unprepared for the impact of increasing climate risks. On an inflation-adjusted basis, Zurich said that average insured losses rose by 5.9% per year between 1994 and 2023, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.7% annually over the same period. "If insured losses continue to grow at this rate, premiums for climate risk coverage will need to increase to reflect the additional risk," Zurich Insurance Group said in the paper. "This in turn, will affect the level of protection that individuals and businesses are willing and able to purchase, with potential consequences for the overall functioning of the market." CAT bonds For insurers and reinsurers, the increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events has coincided with astronomical growth in the catastrophe bond market. First created in the 1990s, so-called CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, said in a recent report that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down.

Article: Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. The probe is focused on whether James' office caused a deprivation of legal rights under the color of law through its civil suits against Trump and his businesses as well as the National Rifle Association, these people said. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers' rights." A spokesperson for the U.S. In 2024, James' office did win its civil fraud case against the longtime head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, with a jury convicting him of diverting millions of dollars from the gun group for his own personal lifestyle. The letter called the "threadbare allegations" the "next salvo in President Trump's revenge tour against Attorney General James." In addition to her fraud case against Trump and his companies, James and her office have launched a number of successful legal challenges to his administration's agenda, dating back to his first term in office. In 2021, he sued to stop her from proceeding with her fraud investigation, saying, "Her mission is guided solely by political animus and a desire to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against a private citizen who she views as a political opponent." The lawsuit also alleged that Trump was the victim of "viewpoint discrimination." Trump later dropped the suit, but has continued to criticize James, including in an April Truth Social post that called her a "wacky" and "totally corrupt politician" who should immediately resign.

Article: Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. "We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That's what we want to do." Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would "take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said: "Well, we don't want to keep it. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who "look very hungry," that there is "real starvation" there and that "you can't fake that." Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said. officials briefed on the call described it as "a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid" in which Trump "was doing most of the talking." "The U.S. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option. The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. "Now all ideas are being exhausted." The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is "no chance they can kill every fighter." The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened. Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza. "Looking at the condition of hostages, it's clear that they don't have much more time," one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.

Article: Meta debuted the Instagram Map tool on Wednesday, pitching the feature as way to "stay up-to-date with friends" by letting users share their "last active location." The tool is akin to Snapchat's Snap Map feature that lets people see where their friends are posting from. Although Meta said in a blog post that the feature's "location sharing is off unless you opt in," several social media users said in posts that they were worried that was not the case. "Instagram randomly updating their app to include a maps feature without actually alerting people is so incredibly dangerous to anyone who has a restraining order and actively making sure their abuser can't stalk their location online…Why," said the user in a Threads post. "We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too," Mosseri wrote on Thursday. "We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share)." Still, some Instagram users claimed that that their locations were being shared despite not opting in to using the map feature. A Meta spokesperson reiterated Mosseri's comments in a statement and said "Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on." "If you do, only people you follow back — or a private, custom list you select — can see your location," the spokesperson said.

Article: Since early last year, Musk has been trying to convince shareholders that Tesla, his only publicly traded business, is poised to become an an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse, and not just an electric vehicle company. A centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles. Tesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis. On Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be "operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents," referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips. On the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent. Musk said the companies "are doing different things." He said, "xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models." Tesla uses "100x smaller models," he said, with the automaker focused on "real-world AI," for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for "artificial super intelligence." Musk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because "they wanted to work on AGI," one reason he said he formed a new company.

Article: In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WASHINGTON, DC August 6: US President Donald Trump shakes hands with CEO of Apple Tim Cook during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday August 6, 2025. "The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back." Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt. "CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time," said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple. "What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters," said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S. For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning , in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an "investment" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning "already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets," adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year. While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that "the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook." Trump had a different take. In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach.

Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly told analysts in the company's Thursday earnings call that there's still some lingering concern from advertisers related to tariffs "and broader market uncertainty" that the company discussed in May.

Article: "In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement," Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he has selected Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to a pivotal seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned Friday. "He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job," Trump added. "By selecting Miran, Trump has made a stop-gap appointment and given himself until January to make the main call," Marco Casiraghi, senior economist and strategist at Evercore ISI, said in a note. "This way Trump did not tie his hands, keeping his options open regarding the choice of the new Fed governor and especially the new Fed chair." Miran still needs Senate confirmation to the seven-person board, something unlikely to happen until the upper house reconvenes in September. With a vote likely weeks away on the nomination, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (S.C.) in a statement praised Miran as "an accomplished economist" who "has been instrumental in advising on economic policy and advancing a pro-growth agenda in his role as CEA Chair." Scott, who has been critical of the Fed's expansion project at two of its Washington buildings, added that he looked forward to "hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics." Prior to serving in the first Trump White House as senior advisor for economic policy under then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Miran was senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. He has since spoke in favor of reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has used extensively this year as part of a global trade war, and he also has been strongly pro-crypto. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the past has advocated for a shadow chair, reasoning that even if the Fed does not meet the administration's demands, Powell's positions could be counteracted by a dissenting voice on the board who would voice the White House's positions on monetary policy.

Article: Bonnie Cash | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. "What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards "Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs," said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. "Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation." For example, just 39% of independents approve of the president's handling of the economy, and that drops to 24% on inflation. The conflicts could be the result of the public simply having trouble keeping up with the breakneck changes to the economy, immigration, taxation and the political system issuing from the Trump administration. Those are the best numbers since the early years of the Biden administration as the nation emerged from the pandemic, and an 11-point improvement from the CNBC survey in April. The sharp improvement to +4 percentage points from -15 percentage points has come with a surge in stocks that followed the president backing off from sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs and the passage of tax legislation.

Article: "GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models," said Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead at OpenAI. The company said it expects to hit 700 million weekly active users on ChatGPT this week, and it is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale at a valuation of roughly $500 billion, as CNBC previously reported . During the briefing, OpenAI demonstrated how GPT-5 can be used for "vibe coding," which is a term for when users generate software with AI based on a simple written prompt. The apps had "some rough edges," an OpenAI lead said, but users can make additional tweaks to the AI-generated software, like changing the background or adding additional tabs, as they see fit. This launch will be the first time that Free users have access to a reasoning model, which is a type of model that "thinks," or carries out an internal chain of thought, before responding. "It's hard to believe it's only been two and a half years since @sama joined us in Redmond to show the world GPT-4 for the first time in Bing, and it's incredible to see how far we've come since that moment," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a Thursday X post, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's appearance at Microsoft headquarters in Washington in February 2023. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, said previous AI models have failed many of the company's most advanced tests because they struggle to make sense of complex math or logic within long documents. But Levie said GPT-5 is a "complete breakthrough." "The model is able to retain way more of the information that it's looking at, and then use a much higher level of reasoning and logic capabilities to be able to make decisions," Levie told CNBC in an interview.

Article: PE firms typically sell their portfolio companies through various exit routes such as trade sales to strategic buyers, secondary sales to other PE firms, and public listings via initial public offerings, allowing them to return capital and profits to limited partners (LPs), who are private equity fund investors. Johns Hopkins Carey Business School Jeff Hooke However, PE firms are buying and investing in more companies than they can offload them — which means investors are trapped in aging funds or waiting longer for their returns. The ratio of PE investments to exits has jumped from 2.6x in 2024 to 3.14x in 2025, the highest in a decade, as firms continue to delay sales, recent data from PitchBook showed . Zombie funds The slowdown has a side effect: the rise of "zombie funds" — private equity vehicles that exist but have little hope of fully exiting their investments or raising new capital. It's just sort of sitting there." A growing number of private equity investors are seeing their capital locked in so-called "zombie funds," a 2024 survey by the secondaries asset manager showed . "This is the second time in the last five years or so that the exit environment has been in this wait-and-see mode," said Kyle Walters, a PE analyst at PitchBook. "LPs were much more understanding the first time around … but this time, you see fewer patient LPs," he told CNBC, adding that LPs are opting to sell off portions of PE portfolios to secondary funds as they opt for cash rather than wait further. According to PitchBook, 54.7% of all active PE funds globally are now six years or older, higher than the 52.2% at the end of 2024 — a sign that fund timelines are stretching well past the norm. What's behind the exit freeze The exit slowdown began as early as 2022 but accelerated after April 2 when the Trump administration announced sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs that jolted financial markets, market watchers said. Harold Hope, global head of secondary investing at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, said the core issue is a "valuation gap" between what PE managers think their companies are worth and what potential buyers are willing to pay. Buyers and sellers are not seeing eye to eye," he said, explaining that the trend began after 2021, when buyers became more conservative as interest rates rose, among other factors. "With a lack of strategic buyers, the dead IPO market here [especially] in the United States, firms are left with the third alternative, which is selling to themselves via a continuation fund, or selling to other private equity funds," Hooke said. "It may never see the IPO market or strategic buyer for, you know, 15-20 years." Other alternatives: continuation vehicles General partners, who are the people or firms managing the private equity funds, are looking to alternative liquidity strategies. Goldman Sachs' Hope noted that continuation vehicles provide a way to generate liquidity in an environment when the fund manager may not want to — or can't — sell the entire business at a value that they believe is appropriate, he said. "Particularly as GPs regularly extend investment periods." The exit drought has also led some private equity managers — especially smaller or mid-sized firms — to explore alternative strategies, including allocating more toward public markets. "Rolling up and constantly putting equity into larger and larger deals is not something that we find relatively attractive going forward," said Jonathan Hahn, investment analyst at private markets investment firm NorthStar Capital. "It's an unsustainable practice… especially with business owners wanting to eventually pull out the equity and actually have it as cash." Instead, Hahn is leaning into the public market opportunity, adding that the firm has launched a new public equities fund because of the recent ramping up of activity within the space. He also observed that PE's sheen may be starting to wear off, noting that some investors are asking themselves: Why would I go into the private markets when I can get the same or better return in public markets and have better liquidity?

Article: The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy." Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer," Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, "we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices." If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030. While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals. But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine. India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler. In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price. "Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. "Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line. A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows. "It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Its total goods' exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data. The resulting drop in exports due to tariffs would mean the economy grows by closer to 6% this year and next, rather than the 7% growth forecast prior to Trump's announcement, Shah said. With notable variance across industries and little clarity over Trump's plans with sector-specific tariffs, here are segments that potentially stand to lose the most: Engineering goods Engineering goods, including products like auto parts, power equipment and industrial machinery, have been India's biggest of exports to the U.S. Rajesh Mehta, executive chairman of Indian jewelry maker Rajesh Exports, said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday that higher tariffs will be an "additional burden," while calling for government support for the sector . "Without a doubt, the new tariff rate is going to seriously test the resolve and resilience of India's textile and apparel exporters as we will not enjoy a significant duty differential advantage vis-à-vis many other countries, except Bangladesh, with whom we compete for a larger share of the US market," the Confederation of Indian textile industry said in a statement dated July 30 , before the latest hike in duties was announced. for 38% of its exports last fiscal year, making it "the most exposed" to potential risks of the tariff exemptions being rolled back, according to Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. In an interview to CNBC Trump said he would initially impose a "small tariff" on pharma, and then raise that rate to as high as 250% in a few years. "[India's] Chemicals overall have somewhat less US exposure but this masks the high pharmaceutical sector's US dependency therein," said Hermann, leaving the pharma sector highly vulnerable to Trump's potential tariffs. India competes against the likes of Europe in pharmaceuticals; Vietnam and Mexico in electronics; Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam in textiles; and Israel in gems and jewelry, according to Wan. In his latest tariff adjustment, Trump also eased tariffs on Thailand to 19% from the "reciprocal" tariff level of 36%, Bangladesh to 20% from 35% and Cambodia to 19% from 36%.

Trump has threatened to impose new sectoral levies that will impact countries including China, such as a tariff on pharmaceuticals that could go up to 200%, and an about 100% "secondary tariff" for buying Russian oil.

Article: President Donald Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States." Details on how much domestic manufacturing is required to qualify for the exemption remain unclear. However, South Korean chip majors Samsung and SK Hynix appeared to be exempted from the 100% tariffs, the country's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo was reported as saying on the radio. "We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors," Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that companies like Apple that are building or committed to building in the U.S. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, noted that "the devil is in the details" as there is no clear framework yet on how exactly the chip tariffs are going to work. While Japanese semiconductor process equipment markets may wobble at the start given the headline shock of "100% tariffs," the move could be positive for the industry given the number of Japanese chipmaking equipment that are indispensable for most chipmakers looking to ramp up U.S. As of this moment, the big companies are the "clear winners," said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, citing companies like Apple, Nvidia and TSMC as the ones with the "most dollars to pledge." "These are the big wins that President Trump wants to get," Newman said, adding that the smaller companies that do not have the same scale and leverage will have to negotiate.

Article: Technicians stand next to an oil rig which is manufactured by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant, during a media tour of the plant in Dhamasna village in the western state of Gujarat, India, August 26, 2021. President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

Article: "India is [a] country with a deep sense of self as an independent actor," he said, adding it will "never play deputy to any sheriff." That marks a stark reversal from earlier optimism, when Modi and Trump aimed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating." "All bets are off now," he added. India's External Affairs Ministry responded sharply to criticism over Russian oil purchases Tuesday, calling it "unjustified and unreasonable." The ministry also pointed out that Western nations criticizing India are themselves continuing to trade with Russia. Nikki Haley urged the administration not to "burn a relationship with a strong ally like India," highlighting that China, which is Russia's top oil buyer, received a 90-day tariff pause in May. Former Indian Finance Secretary Subhash Garg echoed that sentiment on CNBC's " Inside India " Tuesday: "Our positions are so different that there is very little possibility of a reconciliation." He suggested India should absorb the export hit and diversify to domestic or alternative markets.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

Article: The move was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes after the Reserve Bank of India delivered an outsized cut of 50 basis points at its last meeting in June. On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." While domestic growth remains "resilient," the central bank noted that the outlook for external demand is still "uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations." "The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, persisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to the growth outlook." During the RBI's last meeting, Malhotra said that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the 50-basis-point cut in June. As such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative." This means that the Monetary Policy Committee, which is the RBI's key decision-making body, will carefully assess the "incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy," Malhotra said. However, the BofA analysts left the door open for a possible rate cut later this year — likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 — once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. The RBI also maintained its GDP growth forecast for its financial year ending March 2026 at 6.5%, but cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous projection of 3.7%. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee also said on Wednesday that the near-term inflation outlook has "become more benign than anticipated earlier," while inflation in 2025 is expected to remain significantly below the central bank's target of 4%.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S.

But that did not quell growing unease within the country, as many viewed the layoffs as a sign of broader and disruptive changes underway in the IT sector, amplified by the growing influence of AI. TCS and its peers have long relied on India's vast pool of low-cost, skilled labor to produce software services, a model now coming under pressure as AI is set to automate repetitive tasks and as global clients demand higher levels of innovation. The youth unemployment rate in urban areas, among those aged 15 to 29 years, also spiked to nearly 19% from 17.9% in May, and 17.2% in April, according to the statistics ministry. watch now The labor market problem could persist for a few years, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of South Asia economic research at Standard Chartered, urging New Delhi to ramp up efforts in creating more salaried jobs.

Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Article: Businesses across Asia are increasingly warming up to stablecoins for cross-border transactions — a trend set to accelerate further as Hong Kong moves to legalize the use of digital tokens, experts told CNBC. Monthly stablecoin transaction volumes between businesses had surged to more than $3 billion by early 2025, from under $100 million at the start of 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Artemis from May. That has attracted the interest of major payment processors such as Visa , Mastercard , and Stripe , all of which have begun integrating stablecoin support into their payment infrastructure. Capella Hotel, a Singapore-based high-end hotel group, started allowing guests to complete transactions using digital currencies in October last year, due to "growing demand [for] secure and convenient payment option," according to its statement. The boutique handbag reseller is eyeing to expand crypto payments in its Hong Kong branch in the coming months, as well as in its Tokyo branch in the next few years. About 3% of the company's transactions are currently settled in stablecoins — a share that could climb to as much as 20% by year-end, Zhou estimates, translating into half a million Singapore dollars ($387, 512) in monthly revenue. While Beijing sticks to a conservative stance in mainland China, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, has emerged as a regulatory sandbox for Beijing with the aim of preserving its global edge in financial innovation.

"If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy." Last month, Trump likened the trade deal with Japan, which includes a pledge of $550 billion in investment, to "seed money." "Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States.

"The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Egon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets.

Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/heatwaves-drive-spikes-in-demand-for-air-conditioning-across-europe.html
Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

Article: President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum that requires universities to collect admissions data to prove they are not engaged in efforts to shape their student bodies along racial lines, according to the White House. Supreme Court ruling knocked down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, but universities have skirted that decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race. Department of Education said in a statement that Education Secretary Linda McMahon had directed the National Center for Education Statistics to collect from universities data on the race and gender of their applicant pool, on the students admitted and of all enrolled undergraduates. Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 member schools, said collecting such data was illegal under the very Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action. "This seems to be an effort to get institutions to provide information that we don't have and that we can't collect." But a senior Trump administration official said the administration's understanding of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action was that nothing in it "prohibits the collection of demographic data as long as such data is not used in admissions decisions." The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter, spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Article: Mary Kay burns incense at the entrance to the state-managed immigration detention center dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades on August 03, 2025 in Ochopee, Florida. A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Article: Pavel Bednyakov | Sputnik | via Reuters DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan traveled to Russia on Thursday for his second visit to the country in less than a year, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sign of the ever-strengthening ties between the two states. The trip, according to Emirati state media service WAM, was focused on the two countries' "strategic partnership" and on "ways to enhance cooperation, particularly in the economic, trade, investment, energy, and other areas that serve joint development, in addition to regional and international issues of common interest." The UAE is a longtime close ally of the United States and a major military and intelligence partner. It is also Russia's most important economic partner in the Middle East — and trade between the two has ballooned in recent years, particularly since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Bin Zayed told his Russian counterpart: "We would like this figure to be doubled both at the bilateral level and with Eurasian countries during the next five years," adding that relations between the two countries "are developing at an accelerated pace." Russia and the UAE signed a strategic partnership in 2018, and numerous visits between their leaders have been exchanged since then.

"As before, the UAE wants to continue to maintain a diversified foreign policy overall between Russia, the United States, and China, rather than choose only one." The UAE leader's visit also comes as the White House announced an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin to discuss Ukraine war ceasefire efforts — and in the wake of Trump announcing punitive tariffs on India for importing Russian oil, which the American leader says is "fuelling the war machine." For Russia, the ongoing relationship with the UAE is a win and is also "clearly a sign that they are not nearly as isolated as the West would like them to be both diplomatically and economically," said Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Rane. For [UAE leader] MBZ on a political front, this is a demonstration that he is independent of Washington, despite relying on American forces for security," Bohl said, referring to Mohammed bin Zayed by his initials. It is an important transit hub for dual-use goods, meaning goods that can have both civilian and military use, so this trade helps fuel Russia's war on Ukraine," Borshchevskaya said.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the Ukraine issue and discussed the possibility of developing strategic cooperation between Moscow and Washington, but declined to give more details until Witkoff had reported back to Trump.

"Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent," the executive order reads. It's the latest sign that Trump is following through on his threat to punish countries that buy Russian oil, as he's increased his rhetoric in recent weeks over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The tariffs against India came as Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Wednesday in Moscow with Putin, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. A White House official said the meeting "went well" and "the Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States."

The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men. Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as "very manual" and "not efficient." It is "something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were," he said.

WBD reported total revenue for the studios segment — which also includes distributing TV content — increased 55% during the quarter to $3.8 billion, with theatrical revenue up 38%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, because of the higher box-office revenue. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the studios segment was $863 million during the period, up from $210 million during the same period a year prior. In a letter to shareholders, WBD said it expects the momentum to continue, with the studios segment projected to generate at least $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year.

Investors have to decide what they think," Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "But Lilly is rolling, and you look at the beat and raise, strong growth on the back half, we're excited about the future for our company and for patients who need our products." The company's diabetes treatment Mounjaro topped expectations for the second quarter, raking in almost $5.2 billion in revenue. "And we've got a lot more coming in the pipeline."

This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business." The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff. Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 5 cents vs. $580 million expected The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. Overall, operating expenses were down 25% in fiscal 2025, with meaningful cuts to sales and marketing as well as research and development, metrics investors and analysts have long said were too high for the size of Peloton's business.

Article: Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving the way for its entrance into the market. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss "a significant and clinically meaningful outcome." "Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies," he continued. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill "has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects." The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. They bring Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, one step closer to potentially becoming a new, needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. "The goal was to create an oral pill that was convenient and can be made at a huge scale, really, for the mass market, and had weight loss that was competitive with other single-acting GLP-1s, and that's what we've achieved," Ricks said. Ricks said Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with hopes of launching the pill around the world "this time next year." That launch could fundamentally shift the space, helping more patients access the treatments and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacture pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. There are roughly 8 million patients on injectable obesity and diabetes drugs, but likely around 170 million who could benefit from the medicines, said Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in an interview. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at the University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in.

Article: "I think it was pretty loosey goosey for the last year or two, and I think the companies have got a lot better at that right now," said Manish Kashyap, CBRE's global president of leasing. "They're coming up with policies that allow hybrid structures and allow flexibility, but whatever their new policy is, their implementation around that, and the governance around that, is definitely a lot better." Nearly three quarters of the 184 companies surveyed by CBRE said they have met their attendance goals, up from 61% last year. The majority of survey respondents, 67% of companies, said they will either keep their office footprints at the same size or expand them within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago. Concerns about the economy and tariffs do have some companies hesitating to make long-term decisions, but even with that concern, more are taking on long-term leases than were a year ago, CBRE found. "You have organizations that finally have clarity and decision making, because they've been living in this world of hybrid for so long, and now they know what it truly looks like for them, so all those decisions that they may have put off, even if there's a little bit of economic uncertainty right now, they're still willing to move forward with some additional deals," said Julie Whelan, CBRE's global head of occupier research. Despite the fact that overall office vacancies are at 18.9%, just under the 30-year high of 19%, nearly half of the companies surveyed said they were concerned about the availability of high-quality office space over the next three years. That concern is most significant when it comes to prime space, which accounts for only 8% of the total office inventory and has much lower vacancy rate than the rest of the market.

The company has already raised prices by $1 to offset tariff costs and is working to expand its business outside of the U.S. I never thought I would see a day that I'm happy to see 55% tariffs, but it's a lot better than 170%, so I think once we have that resolution, we'll be in a better spot."

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's . Steel – but it's unclear how new leadership at the FTC and Department of Justice will view mergers in the retail industry, which can be felt more acutely by consumers. Amanda Lewis, who spent close to a decade scrutinizing mergers at the FTC and is now a partner at Cuneo Gilbert and LaDuca, previously told CNBC the merger is unlikely to raise many concerns because combined, Dick's and Foot Locker would represent around 15% of the sporting goods market.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs. But he added that "I think the devil will be in the detail." Here's what the company reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 78 cents adjusted vs. The results come after Pfizer in April expanded its cost-cutting efforts, which aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the past few years.

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of." An mRNA model is placed in front of the "Area 100 R&D" research laboratory for personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccines at a new facility of BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, on July 27, 2023.

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: The Bank of England voted by a fine margin to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday as the central bank resumed what it describes as a "gradual and careful" approach to monetary easing. The BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at its latest monetary policy meeting, but traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the decision among the bank's policymakers. As it turned out on Thursday, the nine-member MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the key interest rate, the "Bank Rate," by 25 basis points rather than keeping it on hold. Policy makers have had to weigh up sticky inflation — the consumer price index (CPI) rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — with a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth. In a statement Thursday, the bank said the MPC "remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term." The MPC was initially split on reducing or holding interest rates with four members wanting to hold rates, four others voting to cut and one policymaker voting for a larger 50-basis-point cut.

But as it faces the specter of rebuilding its devastated state after 13 years of war under a new government with a very shaky hold on power, the country needs all the help it can get, regional analysts say — not further punishment. "After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC. "While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States." A collapsed state Syria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post.

Switzerland's federal council said it had "great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." It added that it continued to seek a "negotiated solution" and was in contact with U.S. Manufacturing association Swissmem said a 39% tariff would hit the tech industry, exports and therefore the whole country "extremely hard," noting that every second franc brought into the economy was made from foreign trade. "This will lead to a weakening of the Swiss economy, the Swiss Franc and the Swiss equity market, particularly the all-important export sector." watch now The Swiss government needs to recognize that the time for "cherry picking, carve outs and special deals" is over, particularly for small, highly-exposed states, Wittmann added. Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that a 39% tariff rate would knock around 0.6% off Switzerland's GDP, or more with the inclusion of pharmaceuticals — but that he expected it to be negotiated down. watch now With the Swiss stock market closed for national day, indicators are instead feeding through other avenues such as the performance of London-listed Watches of Switzerland, which fell nearly 9% in morning deals. In a Friday note to clients, analysts at investment bank Jefferies cited the company, along with Richemont and Swatch Group, as among those that would take the biggest hits from the news, particularly relative to previous expectations. The rally has delivered challenges to the economy, which in May marked a return to deflation for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic — spurring the Swiss National Bank to cut interest rates to zero in June. 'I do not think it is the end' Rahul Sahgal, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" the tariff news was "very disappointing" after many rounds of negotiations with the U.S.

Article: imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade New US tariffs cloud outlook for exporters in Asia and beyond BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump’s new tariff rates on U.S. They are a revised version of what Trump called " reciprocal tariffs," announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan. Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on “flexible work” — the gig economy — for their livelihoods, the government estimates. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment. The slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week.

Burt Jones in federal court in Atlanta, asking a judge to permanently cut off Jones' ability to spend money from Jones' leadership committee, a special fundraising vehicle that allows Georgia's governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders to raise unlimited funds. Carr argues that the leadership committee violates Carr's First Amendment right to free speech as well as his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that favors Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone said Jones “is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.” Jones' campaign spokesperson Kendyl Parker called Carr a hypocrite because his office in 2022 defended the same law he is now challenging. The Carr campaign tried to get the state Ethics Commission to investigate the source of a $10 million loan that Jones made to his leadership committee, but the commission declined, saying Carr failed to allege a legal violation. Carr asks the court to block Jones from giving any cash to dark money groups and making any loans to his regular campaign committee during the primary, and wants the magistrate judge to investigate where Jones' $10 million loan came from. Carr's campaign continues to voice concern that Jones could raise unlimited sums to repay his loan and then give the repaid money to his candidate committee to spend in the primary, warning that such laundering would destroy campaign contribution limits.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File) FILE - In this long exposure photo, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a payload of Starlink V2 Mini internet satellites lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., late Sunday, July 23, 2023. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays.

Article: The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it is proposing to extend flight cuts at Newark, one of the three main airports serving the New York City-area, through October 2026 as it continues to face air traffic controller shortage and congestion issues. In May, the FAA ordered flight cuts at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport through the end of 2025 following a series of major disruptions at the United Airlines hub that snarled hundreds of flights and sparked alarm about the aging U.S. The FAA said on Friday the goal of the reduced flight rates is to "continue maintaining safety while alleviating flight delays due to staffing and equipment challenges, resulting in smoother travel into and out of Newark." Last month, the Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said it would investigate the FAA's 2024 decision to relocate some Newark air traffic controllers to Philadelphia from New York to address staffing shortages and congested New York City-area airspace. The FAA said "persistent low staffing levels and low training success rate" at N90 were among the reasons to move control of the Newark airspace in a bid to boost staffing levels and help ease congestion.

Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Thousands bowed their heads in prayer in Nagasaki on Saturday to mark the 80th anniversary of the city's atomic bombing, as the mayor warned that current global conflicts could push the world again into nuclear war. The western Japanese city was levelled on August 9, 1945, when the United States dropped a 10,000-pound plutonium-239 bomb, nicknamed "Fat Man", instantly killing some 27,000 of the city's estimated 200,000 people. Bodies were strewn about like stones." "Is it not this 'global citizen' perspective that will serve as the driving force behind stitching back together our fragmented world?" Suzuki asked, calling for a solution based on mutual understanding and solidarity. Representatives from 95 countries and territories, including nuclear superpower the United States, and Israel - which neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons - attended the annual ceremony at the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Park for the milestone year. "We can only pledge to take the initiative ourselves in making a step toward peace." Japan's leading organisation of A-bomb survivors, Nihon Hidankyo, won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for campaigning for a world without nuclear weapons.

Article: As federal takeover threats loom, the city of Washington waits for the White House to make its move FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in coming evenings as Trump puts into action his longstanding plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” On Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night's operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later doubled down on those comments, telling reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the NPS has aggressively stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier this week, the NPS announced that a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced in line with an Executive Order.

Article: Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men 9 hours ago Share Save Ben Fell BBC News Share Save NASA Who will be the next human to leave their footprint on the surface of the Moon? The loss of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, who guided the stricken mission safely back to Earth in 1970, means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but that date has slipped into 2026, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. The issues with Boeing's Starliner which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the "rapid unscheduled disassemblies" of SpaceX's Starship have become a customary sight to space watchers. NASA Apollo 13 was Jim Lovell's final mission Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth "Houston, we've had a problem" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11) NASA Buzz Aldrin, right, along with his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, before their mission to the Moon On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: "I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew." Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." NASA Charlie Duke, along with Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in Mission Control, during the Apollo 11 mission In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: "Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again." "I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so," he later told the BBC. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17) NASA Harrison Schmitt was the first scientist to visit the Moon Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972.

Article: The death of a New York City police officer in last week’s midtown office tower shooting is highlighting the growth of Bangladeshi immigrants in the nation’s largest police force New York Police officers hang a banner for the funeral of officer Didarul Islam, Thursday, July 31, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis) NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer’s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association. Didarul Islam — one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL’s headquarters — was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty. Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community. Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. “His legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.” When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells. Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved. The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them. “I never dreamt that I would go this far, but I always had an ambition to go somewhere where I can be challenged,” said Siddique, now a member of Mayor Eric Adams' security detail. Give me a chance.” Ishmam Chowdhury, a 26-year-old officer who graduated from the academy in May, said Islam’s death just a few months into his own career has left a lasting impression. “So yeah, I guess that’s a wake-up call for us that even though this is a noble job, we are definitely at grave risk.” Chowdhury said he dreamed of joining law enforcement even before he immigrated to the U.S. He also served about a year in the police force in Washington, D.C., after it opened applications to green card holders in 2023, but he and his wife felt isolated from friends and family.

Article: as President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian exports in July and threatened the delicate balance of supply and demand that holds the industry Why Trump's tariffs could be a disaster for Brazil's acai industry and American consumers BELEM, Brazil -- When U.S. After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it? If only people here eat it, it’s going to be a lot of acai, right?” Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. “If there’s too much acai here, people won’t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.” A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. “We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.” Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023.

Article: NEW YORK -- Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring — and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters. After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas. I want to buy a place, but I’m not going to do that until I’m living there and spend more time in different communities.” According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions. “The one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don’t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,” Barnett said. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities. Every place has trade-offs." If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Learning the grocery store, getting new cellphones, those are just procedural things, but being away from family — that’s the hardest part.” Sarah Friedell O’Connell, a retirement coach in Boston, looks at relocation this way: “You’re going to get a lot of hours back when you stop your full-time job. What are you going to do with that time?" As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona’s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.” He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators — such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family — and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels. Harmer's rule of thumb: When 80 % of your desired daily routine is achievable in a new location for at least 80 % of the year, you’re in the right ZIP code.

Article: More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.” A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms" that pits ratepayer classes against one another. Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather. The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share. Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant. Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.” PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power. The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever. Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed. But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs "will be a challenge.” In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Article: 'Are we not working class enough?' Students divided on civil service internship reform 3 hours ago Share Save George Sandeman BBC News Share Save BBC Some students say they are being left out of a major civil service internship scheme after ministers announced reforms aimed at encouraging more working class people to work for the government. 'I was put off before but now I'll definitely apply' Adam Allen, 20, is from Newark-on-Trent and studies sociology and criminology at the University of Warwick The civil service was not something Adam was aware of until he went to university and attended some outreach events. "How was I going to stand a chance against everyone else that's had a bit more of a leg up and a bit more of an advantage than me, in terms of personal networks and knowledge?" Around 200 people are expected to be admitted to the revamped internship programme next year. Adam, who is part of social mobility organisation The 93% Club for state school students at British universities, says changes to the internship programme have prompted him to think again about the civil service. "It feels like I will now be taken seriously and no longer just someone [applying] without a real shot." 'Working class but not working class enough?' Nell Ashworth, 21, is from King's Lynn and studies social policy at the University of York As the daughter of a nurse, the virtues of public service were something Nell Ashworth grew up with. "I've done all of this preparation for, I suppose, not very much reward." Nell is all too aware that those who perform well during the summer internship, which typically takes place between the second and third year of a university course, can be fast-tracked into a graduate job in the civil service. Civil service interns must be working class, government says Labour must tell its working class story, says minister The criteria now being used for the internships are set out by the Social Mobility Commission, an independent body which advises the government. "If I'd have known then I could have changed my plans and applied for this summer's internship instead." State school-educated Nell, whose parents were the first in their families to go to university, says she understands why the government is trying to encourage more people with working class backgrounds into the civil service. And then that puts me off working in the civil service because now I have no idea who's looking out for me." 'It will make the civil service more representative' Hannah Begum, 20, is from Leeds and studies politics and international relations at the London School of Economics (LSE) Improving society is central to what Hannah Begum would like to do for a career. "A lot of them don't really know what it means to live in Leeds or live up north and how different it can be." Hannah thinks there are far more opportunities for high-quality work experience when you are based in London - never mind the savings on accommodation and travel costs - and that reforms to civil service internships will open doors for people like her. "We're not going to get those people in government if we don't create the stepping stones in order for them to enter." Hannah does understand why the reforms to internships are controversial for some, but she urges them to see things from her perspective. "It needs to be taken into account that not everyone has the same privileges in terms of being able to get a job in government… [the reforms] are not going to mean less intelligent people getting in, it just means a bit more of an equal chance." 'It feels like the country I love doesn't want me'

Article: UK sees rise in complaints over thin models 8 hours ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards • @edwardsclm Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images The banning of high street fashion adverts which featured models who looked "unhealthily thin" has led industry experts to warn of a return to the super skinny trend. The aesthetic characterised by models with hollow faces and protruding bones was seen in the 1990s and early 2000s but in more recent years been pushed aside to allow space for the body positive movement which embraced curves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in 2025 it had received five or six of these complaints a week but in the two weeks after July's M&S ad ban it had more than 20. Getty Images Charli Howard is a model and body positivity activist Model and activist Charli Howard wrote a viral open letter after being dropped by her modelling agency for being "too big" despite being a UK size six to eight. A decade on she says: "I think we're on the cusp of seeing heroin chic return." The phrase heroin chic was used in the early 1990s, when some models were extremely thin, pale and had dark under eye circles reminiscent of drug use. In June, TikTok blocked search results for "skinnytok" - a hashtag which critics say directs people towards content which "idolises extreme thinness." "Some women are naturally thin, and that's absolutely fine. Next This Next advert was banned for portraying the model as "unhealthily thin" Zara, which had two adverts banned last week, said that both models had medical certification proving they were in good health. During her 20-year career she noticed "a brief moment of increased inclusivity" but was still turned down for jobs for "not being thin enough." "The body positivity movement raised awareness, but it didn't fully change the system. 'Many women are naturally very slim' Zara This Zara advert was recently banned by the UK advertising regulator Fashion journalist and consultant Victoria Moss does not think we are facing "heroin chic" but instead connects the trend to the rise of weight loss injections. "What's happening at the moment across broader culture is about thinness being held up as a moral health imperative, driven by the fervour over GLP-1 weight loss medication," she says. 'Body diversity is key' Simone Konu-Rae stylist and senior lecturer in fashion communication at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts, London says while it is important to "appreciate that the human body comes in a range of shapes and sizes", being thin is not necessarily back in fashion "it simply never went away". "The High Street is saying 'look, we have the same model as your favourite luxury brand, and our products look just as good at a fraction of the price'," she adds.

Article: NCA to investigate police officer sex abuse claims 16 hours ago Share Save David Spereall BBC News, Yorkshire Ed Thomas UK editor Share Save Getty Images Five women who were exploited by grooming gangs in Rotherham as children say they were also abused by police officers The National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over an investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham. The BBC reported in July that five women who were exploited by grooming gangs as children have said they were also abused by police officers in the town in the 1990s to early 2000s. Women abused as children by Rotherham gangs say police also sexually assaulted them ACC Barnett said: "Concerns around the mode of investigation have put the force, and not the victim survivors, at the centre of the narrative, and this fails to align with a truly victim-centred investigation. "I am also mindful there is a chance that some victim survivors may be suffering in silence and unwilling to make a report as a result of SYP's involvement." The inquiry will be carried out by officers from Operation Stovewood - the NCA's wider investigation into non-recent child sexual abuse in Rotherham. Prof Alexis Jay, who led the landmark 2014 report which exposed the scale of offending by grooming gangs in the town between 1997 and 2013, had told the BBC she was "shocked" the force was investigating its own former officers. Stephen Fildes/BBC Prof Alexis Jay previously said SYP should not be leading an investigation into its own former officers Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp had also called for a separate body to lead the probe, saying there could be no "conflicts of interest". Among the witness accounts reported by the BBC was the testimony of one woman who said she was raped from the age of 12 by a serving SYP officer in a marked police car. "Though our investigation will be independent of South Yorkshire Police, we will work closely with the force and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) to ensure that victims receive the best service and support as the investigation is transferred to us," he said. 'Step in the right direction' Last month, law firm Switalskis said it had hoped that alleged abuse by officers would have been unearthed following Operation Linden - a long-running IOPC investigation into how police responded to child sexual abuse in Rotherham. In a statement on Friday, Switalskis said: "We are pleased that SYP has decided to hand the investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse, corruption, and the facilitation of abuse by former SYP officers to the NCA. "Nevertheless, we view this as a step in the right direction and hope that more survivors will now feel able to come forward to the NCA." Operation Stovewood is investigating non-recent child sex abuse in Rotherham The IOPC said it had responded to "concerns about SYP's involvement and a perception of a conflict of interest". The IOPC said that "while we remain satisfied there was no conflict of interest with SYP", it believed that "transferring the investigation to the NCA may provide further reassurance to victim-survivors".

"If we continue on this trajectory, we will end up thrusting ourselves into a nuclear war." The attack on 9 August 1945, which analysts say hastened the end of World War Two, killed an estimated 74,000 people. Saturday's ceremony came a few days after the commemoration of the first atomic bombing, which targeted the Japanese city of Hiroshima 80 years ago on 6 August, killing an estimated 140,000 people. As part of Saturday's ceremony, water offerings were made in a moving and symbolic gesture - 80 years ago victims whose skin was burning after the blast had begged for water.

Article: Beloved by bands and bank robbers, the Ford Transit turns 60 9 hours ago Share Save Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent Share Save BBC Theo Leggett at the wheel of the oldest Ford Transit still in existence Climbing into a 1965 Ford Transit is like stepping into a time capsule on wheels. "There are lots of iconic cars: the Morris Minor, the Mini, the Land Rover, the VW Beetle, but there's only one iconic van, and that's the Transit," says Edmund King, president of the AA. Erica Echenberg via Getty Images Punk band The Damned was one of the groups to use Ford Transits on tour, seen here in 1977 Originally a collaboration between Ford's engineers in the UK and Germany, and primarily aimed at the British and European markets, the Transit was designed to be as versatile as possible. Before you know it, I had 180 workers in 28 Transit vans driving around London." 'Britain's most wanted van' The Transit's speed and loading space also appealed to people on the wrong side of the law. In 1972, so the story goes, a Metropolitan Police spokesman claimed Transits were being used in 95% of bank raids, adding that its speed and loading space meant it had become the perfect getaway vehicle. Meanwhile the stereotype of the bullying "white van man", defined by Sunday Times reporter Jonathan Leake in 1997 as "a tattooed species, often with a cigarette in his mouth, who is prone to flashing his lights as he descends on his prey", did not specifically target Transit drivers. Bloomberg via Getty Images Ford Transit production moved to Turkey in 2013 Today, Ford continues to highlight both the Transit's British heritage and the work that still takes place here, especially at its UK headquarters in Dunton, Essex. But we also build our diesel engines in Dagenham, just down the road, and we make power packs for electric vans in Halewood, near Liverpool." Most of the company's European production remains in Turkey, and that looks unlikely to change.

The massacre increased tensions between India and Pakistan, leading to the worst military confrontation in decades and the death of dozens of people, until a ceasefire was reached on May 10 after U.S mediation.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) A North Korean military guard post, loudspeaker, top right, and South Korean military guard post, bottom, are seen from Paju, South Korea, near the border with North Korea, Monday, Aug. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s military said Saturday it detected North Korea removing some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, days after the South dismantled its own front-line speakers used for anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts, in a bid to ease tensions. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t disclose the sites where the North Koreans were removing speakers and said it wasn’t immediately clear whether the North would take all of them down. In recent months, South Korean border residents have complained that North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda broadcasts. The South Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June after Seoul’s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, halted the South’s broadcasts in his government’s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals. South Korea’s military began removing its speakers from border areas on Monday but didn't specify how they would be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed if tensions flared again. North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn’t immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers. The speakers blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs, a playlist designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim has been pushing an intense campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family’s dynastic rule. The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea’s advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan. Lee, who took office in June after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, wants to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon’s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue. But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, rebuffed overtures by Lee’s government in late July, saying that Seoul’s “blind trust” in the country’s alliance with the United States makes it no different from its conservative predecessor. She later issued a separate statement dismissing the Trump administration’s intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea’s denuclearization, suggesting that Pyongyang — now focused on expanding ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine — sees little urgency in resuming talks with Seoul or Washington. Tensions between the Koreas can possibly rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. North Korea labels the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.

Article: After some delays and many adjustments, most of President Trump's tariffs kicked in this week, setting a 15% rate on most countries, though some others such as India could face much higher import taxes. The automaker said in July tariffs had already cost the carmaker about $1.1 billion in the previous quarter, but it opted to largely absorb those expenses and take a hit to profits. For example, the Budget Lab at Yale estimates that prices for clothing and textiles will be among those that see the biggest impact in the short term, with shoe prices potentially rising 39%. As noted, who pays the tariffs will likely be split, so a 15% tariff on the European Union, for example, doesn't necessarily mean that you'll pay 15% more for Italian olive oil. Sponsor Message The Budget Lab at Yale estimates the average cost from tariffs for households will be $2,400 this year, but it's an estimate based only on what's known about tariffs so far. Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Federal Reserve president, this week recalled how former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan used to say he knew when the central bank was successful in battling inflation: People wouldn't even be thinking about it. "So people are thinking about this, and I worry about what that means for how consumers and businesses will approach their strategies for engaging the market moving forward." toggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images North America The labor market could get worse The effects of tariffs could potentially also hit people where it tends to hurt the most: their job security.

Article: Equipped with her own tailored bee suit and a hood to cover her floppy ears, Maple — a former police dog — has an important retirement task: helping save thousands of honeybee hives. American foulbrood only becomes detectable to humans by smell when it reaches severe infection, at which point the colony risks death, said Meghan Milbrath, a researcher and assistant professor of entomology at Michigan State University. (Video: Michigan State University) “She basically just turns all of that effort into a few minutes of her running around sniffing,” Milbrath said of the 9-year-old dog, who works at MSU’s Pollinator Performance Center. It’s part of a larger bee conservation effort in a record-breaking year for colony death in the United States, according to a survey by Apiary Inspectors of America, Auburn University and Oregon State University. The colony losses, estimated at 56 percent in the year beginning in April 2024, result in an “increasing challenge to meeting the demand for crop pollination and honey production in the U.S.,” the survey said. Maple follows the paw prints of other “bee dogs” across the country that have delved into conservation — including Darwin, a German shorthaired pointer in North Carolina; Mack, a retired Labrador retriever from Maryland; and Mack’s successor, Tukka, a springer spaniel. Stejskal said Maple took a misstep and got injured while they were working on a cold case in Canada, forcing her to step away in April 2024 after seven years as a human-remains detection dog.

Article: — In a city that savors its short summers, Mayor Ben Walsh is telling residents to prepare to be disappointed as millions are slashed from the community budget, affecting everything from seasonal festivals to landscaping in parks. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “People pay their taxes and rightfully have an expectation that certain services are going to be delivered,” Walsh said of the cuts that went into effect July 1. “The current budget threatens our ability to deliver those services in a way that I believe our constituents deserve … People are going to feel it.” The $16 million drop in spending in one of New York’s largest cities mirrors budget woes playing out around the country as fears of economic uncertainty build. From big cities such as Los Angeles and Houston to smaller ones including Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Yakima, Washington, leaders nationwide are curtailing services or raising taxes to try to cover budget shortfalls. Advertisement Those programs, which pumped tens of billions of dollars into cities during the coronavirus pandemic, are winding down around the same time the Trump administration plans to slash some federal funding over political disputes about immigration, environmental and diversity policies. (Syracuse recently lost a $30 million grant to rebuild a historically Black neighborhood severed by the construction of Interstate 81.) Advertisement Advertisement “At this point, there is a lot of uncertainty and people trying to figure out what the full impacts will be,” said Chris Morrill, executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association, which has 26,000 members in the United States and Canada. “So many of them are being very cautious about doing anything new and looking at reducing some costs while trying to hold onto their rainy-day funds.” Experts said the challenges aren’t as great as those cities faced during the 2008 recession or the pandemic. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Walsh, an Independent, sought to balance the city’s $330 million budget with a 2 percent increase in property taxes and the withdrawal of $27 million from Syracuse’s emergency “rainy day” fund. “My approach has been to try to control our destiny as much as we can through the services we provided.” But the city’s 10-member Common Council, all Democrats, opposed Walsh’s plan. Advertisement “We are dealing with macrolevel uncertainty that filters down to the state level, the local level, and then down to the household level,” said Corey Williams, the chairman of the Common Council finance committee. “We are trying to minimize the uncertainty at the household level.” Advertisement Advertisement The council also rejected Walsh’s request to dip into reserve funds, fearing a bigger financial crisis could be looming. “I personally did not feel it was pouring at the moment — it was drizzling with a storm on the horizon.” Despite Walsh vetoing the budget cuts, the council overrode him in May. Walsh said he was merely trying to be “honest and transparent with my constituents.” Advertisement His list contained nearly a dozen ways the Syracuse Police Department would be affected by a $3.5 million cut, including slashing overtime. The spending cuts including the elimination of funds for the city’s network of ShotSpotter cameras that detect gunfire, which will make it harder for officers to curb gun violence and help victims, Cecile said. It’s also cutting funding for two housing inspectors, which Walsh’s statement said “negatively impacts the ability of the city to help ensure safe, quality housing.” Advertisement Syracuse is a city where a large concentrations of properties that have fallen into disrepair and it has one of the highest rates of childhood lead poisoning in the country. “And if you can’t enforce compliance, in terms of getting a housing inspector out to a property, that leaves children and all inhabitants of that home in danger.” Williams and Monto, the council members, said the budget they passed merely included broad spending targets.

On this idea of working with both parties, The Forward, which is a progressive Jewish outlet, reported a few months ago that in a speech to Republican attorneys general this summer, you said that student activists were “frothing at the mouth, looking like they just came out of Mosul.” You said that there is a “convergence of what I call the radical left and, like, Islamist groups here in the U.S.” And you praised the Trump administration’s punishing of universities like Harvard and others, saying, “God bless Secretary McMahon,” referring to the secretary of education. 1, I certainly was talking about activists, but only those who are completely masked, who don’t show their identity, who are dressed like other people we’ve seen unfortunately on the field of battle, and those student activists who are screaming and harassing and threatening other students. And then I give credit to the Trump administration for actually implementing aspects of the plan and taking a strong view, again, in the face of real, not imagined, real acts of hate, real acts of discrimination. Maybe I went a little overboard saying “God bless.” And at the same time, when I met with Secretary McMahon, I met with her in her office and told her, “Yes, I appreciate what you’re doing on these universities leaning in, and I’m worried about overreach, because going too far could not only harm the universities, it harms our whole country.” And the fact of the matter is, pulling back funding for research can have lots of deleterious impacts. So I said to her and to the antisemitism task force, “Yes, lean in, but don’t go too far.” What would be a sign that this administration has overcorrected, in your view?

Article: A police officer has died from injuries sustained while responding to a shooting outside the headquarters of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is near Emory University. "A courageous local law enforcement officer gave his life, and another was injured, after a gunman opened fire on at least four CDC buildings," she wrote in a post on X. "DeKalb County police, CDC security, and Emory University responded immediately and decisively, helping to prevent further harm to our staff and community." In a press briefing given on Friday, police said they became aware of a report of an active shooter at around 16:50 local time (21:50 BST) at a road intersection "immediately" in front of the CDC campus. Police said they found the shooter "struck by gunfire" on the second floor of a CVS pharmacy by the intersection - but could not specify on Friday whether that was from law enforcement or self-inflicted.

Article: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defiantly declared Saturday that his countrymen "will not give their land to occupiers," after President Donald Trump suggested that a peace deal would include some "swapping" of territories with Russia. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." His comments came after Trump announced on Truth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska. we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever." A White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were "decisions against peace," adding, "They will not achieve anything." The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday. The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.

Article: CNN — Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine. In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion. CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022. Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.” “There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.” He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.” But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.” “They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.” Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable. In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Article: Senate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly. Democrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success. Feinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.” She recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.” Cardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein. The Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns. Democrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor. Asked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.” “Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol. Feinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary. But Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.” Asked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Article: CNN — The governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists. The recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported. In the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.” Jennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News. “For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement. The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.” “Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered.

Article: CNN — The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. Video Ad Feedback Satellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant 03:36 - Source: CNN Satellite images show changes Russia are making to occupied nuclear plant 03:36 “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age. Children ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane. For everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.

A massive winter storm started the service problems during the holiday season, but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights. Part of what created worse problems at Southwest than at other airlines is that crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify it electronically, to let them it of their availability.

That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.” The 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team. “He’s here.” Hamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.” The safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL. I want to stand for that.” Beane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player “is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.” “(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added. “We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.” According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.

Article: CNN — The top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is “particularly proud of this sailor.” The sailor, LTJG Audrey Knutson, had their story shared on the Navy’s Instagram page last week. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted a portion of the clip with the caption, “While China prepares for war, this is what they have our US Navy focused on.” On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had “a lot of problems with the video.” But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.” Gilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary. “We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.” Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.” Last month, Republican Rep.

The district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.” It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.” No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.

Article: For the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify. Although Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace. Cars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.” Deserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971. Add to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution. David Boe/AP “Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.” Sherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail. Scott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division “We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.” Only Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments. “It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.” Alstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states. Incoming high-speed lines In March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor. The 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027. Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: “As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America’s most skilled workers to get there.” Brightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada. Coupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes. Costing $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion. With California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt. “The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours. “When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.” According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions. Rail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%. The enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.

So when First Lady Jill Biden visited the city to attend a vigil for the shooting victims of the Covenant School, it was an absolute given that a country music artist would be there. When a country singer gets off the road, chances are at 8:00 in the morning on Monday after the big weekend, that guy or gal is in line dropping their kid off at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. Audie Cornish 00:03:14 So getting an emoji like that or getting the obligatory "are you okay" that we all start to send each other now when there's a shooting, especially at a school, you're saying it it hits you in a place of what? Audie Cornish 00:06:59 I guess I want to start maybe with Wagon Wheel, because if people go to look you up, that might be the first song they learn about. I wrote it when I was about 17, going to school up in New England in a prep school called Exeter, and I was had just learned to play the banjo up there. Hey mama rock me Audie Cornish 00:07:46 You talk about the idea that your best known song, Wagon Wheel, is often blasting out of a truck, so to speak, that has an NRA sticker. Ketch Secor 00:08:05 When you make the kind of music that I make with a fiddle and a banjo and harmony singing and a particular style of songwriting, you're engaging in a community that might be different than your own sort of background, and it's not. Audie Cornish 00:08:50 And when you're around Nashville and you have political conversations, wherever the person falls on the spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this is The South. And whether it's supposed to be that way or, you know, I think we're in a state of considerable growth down south, but the vestiges remain, and they're important to talk about in this regard, because one of the vestiges is gun culture, and it's largely considered like the rebel flag in the past, just something that exists here. Ketch Secor 00:11:15 Well, I didn't know to go into this, but but I'm excited that we are, Audie, because, you know, country music really especially, and to clarify, contemporary country music on the radio is a real safe space for us to not talk about political divisiveness and not talk about things of of substance. So this sort of, you know, hallmark kind of these ideals that are tossed around might not be that realistic for today's reality of, you know, I worked I'm part of a global economy working two jobs. Instead, they are allowed to say, I taught my child how to, you know, I mean, when I was a kid in the eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned how to fire a weapon. So this is my way of saying it's not over and it won't be over until those deaths, those three deaths of American children gunned down in the third grade, until they mean something, that's when it'll be over. If in all these states and it's not just Tennessee, you've got these blue cities, these little blue dots in a sea of red, and by red I mean very conservative, very pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment legislatures. And and when Nashville in the early 1960s, in the late 1950s said its first foot forward, this was the proving ground, other parts of the South were too unsafe. You know, 50 years from now I think we're going to be looking back at these couple of years as the deciding time for a assault weapons ban in the United States. Audie Cornish 00:18:59 Again, I want to bring it to the question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones who given what we know about the music, number one, have been socially punished for activism by what we call Music Row, by music radio, by country music radio in particular, which still has a very kind of strong grip in a way programmers do, and even recent history. Ketch Secor 00:20:20 Hey, I'm just reaching out to all my Nashville music community in the wake of the shooting and sharing this story that I wrote that came out today in The Times. And when you look at the the roster, who's on the marquee, it's not the usual Americana folks who always say, you know, we stand with kids, we stand up against gun violence. Ketch Secor 00:22:34 There's nothing but up here because we we have started at the very baseline where music coming out of Nashville on the radio says nothing about violence against children in our schools or about the need to rethink the types of weaponry that is associated with the Second Amendment. You know, generally, just like I'm in a songwriting mood here, I'm in a a moment in time with a lot of different opportunities as a writer to engage on this, whether it's, you know, writing the right caption for a photograph on Instagram or writing an op ed piece for The New York Times or being on this podcast with you, Audie. There's so many ways to choose my words right now and try and have them be resonant for the pain that we're feeling in Nashville, Tennessee and around the country because we are just so tired, parents, that our kids are not safe in their schools. What that means for me as a songwriter is that I also have the chance to write new music about this and to put my money where my mouth is.

Article: (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.) Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic. For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Either way, here are some key things to know: Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Interest on your savings Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains) Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle Unemployment income Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account Tips Gambling winnings Income from a rental property you own Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received. “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions. Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million. Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more.

Article: Why some undocumented immigrants choose to pay taxes The National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including: • It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws. • Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform. How some pay taxes despite not having Social Security numbers Critics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.” Some noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method. Immigrant rights advocates are speaking out on social media In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue. “Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time. Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist who’s turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter.

Article: CNN — Tuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz Tax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that: Tax all types of income the same for high earners Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income. Tax wealth or unrealized capital gains We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable.

Article: “We Norwegians are usually modest people,” Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, “But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.” When you see this sundial, you'll know you're halfway through. If you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.” While the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle.

Article: Berlin-based Boris Eldagsen won the creative open category at this year’s Sony World Photography Award with his entry “Pseudomnesia: The Electrician.” The eerie black and white image shows two women from different generations – the older woman appearing to hang on to the younger woman from behind. Eldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to “separate competitions for AI-generated images.” Eldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a “cheeky monkey” in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images. They are not.” ‘Not about winning’ Eldagsen told CNN Tuesday: “It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don’t need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.” He said that AI had left many photographers feeling “threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.” Eldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation. “I was just making a test to see if they were aware – like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.” In further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement. ‘Misleading’ claims The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition’s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the “co-creation” of this image using AI. “As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.” The statement said organizers recognize “the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.” “While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,” the World Photography Organisation added.

Article: Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.” "Elder Sex" is Marilyn Minter's full set of images originally shot for a New York Times Magazine story on senior sex and intimacy. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy Marilyn Minter & LGDR A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors’ sex lives. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work. Seeking partners In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.” In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged. I’m not going to fake anything here.’” Changing attitudes Minter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said. Video Ad Feedback Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 - Source: CNN Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 But the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Though “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR She hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.

Article: New York CNN — Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure. Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them. Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.

McDonald's USA The improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations — a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald’s customers. “We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,” thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald’s (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call.

Article: CNN — Shares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 3% in early trading Monday after a report sparked concerns that its core search engine could lose market share to AI-powered rivals, including Microsoft’s Bing. Last month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Google’s search engine, prompting a “panic” inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.) In an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. In a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to “improve the quality of our results” and “offer entirely new ways to search,” including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words. “Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.” Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge. At an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring “the magic of generative AI” directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.” Microsoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Microsoft’s Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to “be responsible in each step along the way” as they build and release AI tools. For Google, he said, that means allowing time for “user feedback” and making sure the company “can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.” He also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.

Article: The best bidets we tested Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Finding the best bidet for your home can make a world of difference. Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Attachment Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored If you’re looking for a low-cost bidet that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is the bidet for you. Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushy’s compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of toilets here. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While I love the Tushy attachment, there’s one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa — and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested — wasn’t effective. Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience. Beyond being effective, the Toto’s stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or you’re worried a bidet with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more. Even though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you don’t have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored The Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isn’t much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Tushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features — a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water — for $359. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. Plus, since the Cloud doesn’t have a tank, it doesn’t look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water. The Cloud’s side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesn’t have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use. However, the round version of that bidet can feel a little small, so if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, our old value pick, the Alpha JX2, is probably the best bidet for you. How we tested I’ve conducted multiple rounds of testing and have formally tested 31 bidets over a period of nearly four years to find the best ones on the market. Performance General experience: I noted my overall impressions while using each bidet and what traits stood out the most, whether it was the comfort of the stream, simplicity of controls, ease of setup, etc. Aim/directional spray: I noted how good the aim of each bidet’s spray was and the overall range if it was adjustable and counted how many positions each bidet’s spray had. Number of key features: I counted the number of key features, which were whether the bidet had warm water, whether it had a dryer and whether it had a remote. Think of the Tushy Classic 3.0: You’re not replacing your seat, just putting a thin attachment underneath it (Tushy released two attachments, the Wave and Oasis, which actually replace your seat like an electric bidet. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments don’t have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didn’t get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Electric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, the Tushy Cloud and one of our previous picks the Alpha JX2, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy. So if you have a one-piece toilet you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidet’s requirements. While it’s a nice upgrade from the Classic, this bidet is missing the ability to adjust the stream’s position — a basic feature I was shocked wasn’t included — and it’s quite pricey. Other bidet seats we tested Alpha Bidet Alpha JX2 Bidet Seat Alpha Bidet This Alpha bidet seat was our previous best value bidet but was dethroned by the Tushy Cloud. Toto Washlet C5 Bidet Seat Toto If you want the remote and user presets of the K300 but don't need the endless warm water, the Toto C5 is the bidet for you. $469 $391 at Amazon This bidet is a slight upgrade from our runner-up bidet seat, the Toto Washlet C2, adding a remote control and the ability to set two user presets. The remote is oriented horizontally, so it isn’t as easy to use with one hand as some other remotes I tried, and the arm of the Cloud has lights so you can see which setting you’re on, which the remote of the Cloud+ does not. The flashiest feature of the Aura is its auto-open lid, which could be useful in a larger bathroom, but whenever I’d walk into mine the sensor would detect movement and it would open. Nova Bidet Eco Nova Bidet Seat Nova Bidet This bidet only comes in elongated versions and wasn't as comfortable to use as other bidets we tested, especially when it came to its dryer. Toto Washlet A2 Elongated Bidet Seat Toto If all you want is a comfortable stream, this Toto bidet is an okay pick, but I think the warm air dryer of the C2 is worth the extra money. $272 $245 at Amazon The most budget-friendly of Toto’s Washlet Bidet Series, the A2 includes many of the great features as the C2 — warm water, dual action spray with oscillator, adjustable water temp and volume settings, heated seat with temperature control and that convenient arm control panel we love. It’s high on comfort and ease of use, but for less than $100 more, the C2 provides warm air drying with three temperature settings, automatic deodorizer, technology that auto-cleans the wand and it also comes in round-front bowl styles. Prime Day Deal Bio Bidet BB-550 Bidet Seat Bio Bidet If you don't want to commit to spending as much for a bidet seat, this is another solid option, but it isn't as feature-filled as the C2. Easy to install once we traded out the toilet supply line hose for a longer, more flexible $10 piece from the hardware store, we like that it comes loaded with features including warm water, an adjustable heated seat, a seat sensor to keep any accidental sprays from happening, a warm air dryer, adjustable water pressure and even a night light. But the controls are located on the sides of the seat, which makes them much less intuitive to use than the Toto Washlet C2 and the Toto’s stream and dryer also prove to be more comfortable. Its spray wasn’t quite as good as Toto’s, and its dryer didn’t cover the wide area that Toto’s did, but it was comfortable, and in general, I enjoyed using this bidet. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but I think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX2 do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was my favorite stream pattern out of all the bidets I tested. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200; however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway bidets. Editor’s Note: We previously tested the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat, the Alpha Bidet JX and the Coway Bidetmega 200 Electric Bidet Seat, but they have since been discontinued and removed from this article.

Not only will a WoolAid biodegrade in four months, but while it’s on, the skin and wound underneath can breathe and thus stay dry rather than getting that unpleasant soggy feeling. — Rena Behar, copy editor $9 at Grove $20 at Amazon Baggu Standard Baggu Baggu Saying goodbye to single-use plastics at the grocery store is an easy way to become more environmentally sound. I love my Baggu bag for trips to the grocery store — or Target or CVS or Sephora — because it can fit pretty much everything I buy in one bag and be carried like a tote over my shoulder. — Emily McNutt, former senior travel editor $14 at Baggu $14 at Urban Outfitters Floofah for the Kitchen Floofah I have always hated plastic loofahs, but I have never found a great alternative.

Article: Just the past couple of weeks, we’ve seen the White House Fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency responsible for providing unbiased info on the labor market, because the president was displeased with the jobs report. But I think it’s worth remembering — or this is, I guess, my view — that him going after district redistricting in the country, him being obsessed with tariffs, those I think in his mind, aren’t related to each other. And he doesn’t want to lose control of the House next year, knowing that losing control of the House not only puts an end to his legislative agenda such that it exists, but exposes him to political vulnerability. And so far, of course, the Senate has gone along with him in virtually every respect, and he feels there are no guardrails and he can just do what he wants. But I also think that one of the things that he’s worked on since he got into office, even before, is undermining all other sources of authority, not just in terms of what kind of power they have, but also how people view them. He wants everybody to distrust the Department of Justice or the courts or certainly the media, because he wants them to be viewed as illegitimate, which just makes him the only source that his people look to. And I do think that this kind of falls into the category of if you can make everything look super partisan and super sketchy, that’s just in service of his greater power grab. This is a process that has gone on this for 100 years, in which two different sets of surveys are done, compiled by career members of the BLS and then released to the public. In 2012, Jack Welch, well lauded CEO of General Electric, claimed that in the run up to Obama’s re-election, the BLS had manipulated the unemployment number to show it going below 8 percent and he didn’t believe it had gone below 8 percent So the BLS has had these kinds of attacks before, but this is certainly one of the most remarkable things I’ve ever seen, where the president literally just woke up and fired the head of the BLS and claimed all the numbers were made up, which, as I just said, not a single economist. Steve mentioned earlier that the president seems to have this belief that he can of fire anyone in the executive branch and the entire federal bureaucracy and replace him with whomever he deems appropriate, kind of irrespective of what Congress has said. And part of the argument for this is that it enhances political accountability, the president being democratically accountable to the American people, giving him this kind of broader, almost unlimited removal power, and thus enhances the accountability of executive branch officials for the American people. And I’ll make one last point about this, which is historically, and I’m not here to tell you, I know for sure that this time will be the same or different. Well, that’s what I was going to ask you both, is that this move by Trump spotlights his panic about what’s happening, certainly how it will impact his party’s fortunes and whether he keeps a death grip on the government going forward. I mean, do you think that the tariffs and what we’ve got coming and the softening job numbers are the beginning of what Trump has been worried about or at least what his party has been worried about in terms of people actually being able to see what’s going on. If it turns out that under Trump there is a significant economic slowdown, if there is a recession, even I think that is a moment where the bottom can really fall out from under his administration and his political standing. But I do think that that’s a real danger for him, that in the absence of any other compelling thing outside of his particular cult of personality, to keep him buoyed up with the rest of the public, he just doesn’t have that much. quite negative, I think honestly, I would say on behalf of all of us who are journalists or opinion people or commentators on the situation, I think we’ve actually done a pretty good job of explaining to the American people what’s really going on in the Trump administration and what’s not going on, and I think that’s part of why he panics and does something like the BLS, but when you see polling data on that, I think you’re going to find that even that has backfired on him, and people are simply not going to believe that the data is manipulated or that he did the right thing in firing the head of the BLS. O.K, so the topic of political danger is a perfect segue into the second part of this, which is I have been following the Texas redistricting drama for weeks, since well before the new congressional maps were posted. So this week’s Hot new development is that Republicans have drafted the FBI to help them track down and arrest Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state in an effort to bog down this power grab. In response, Democrats I’ve been talking to including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, understand that they cannot take the so-called high road any longer, but are going to need to dig in and punch back hard. So my thought watching all of this, and I believe my suggestions way back when, was just that Congress should pass a bill ending partisan gerrymandering, which is well within Congress’s power to do. I think that the country should move away from single member districts, which necessitate gerrymandering, and move towards multi-member districts, which could open the door to more viable third parties in the American system. So in Texas, if they’re going to squeeze out five more Republican leaning congressional districts, this necessarily means spreading Democratic voters across other already Republican leaning districts, and these new districts may be only modestly or slightly Republican leaning, and prior districts from which you’re moving. And so part of what’s funny to me about all of this is that it’s clear that Donald Trump has a vision of what gerrymandering is, which is just that it’s a generic way to get more seats and there’s no cost to it. The other thing I’ll say here, just in terms of fighting fire with fire, whatever cliche you want to use is that there aren’t that many high population Republican states. And so if you do get into this game of tit for tat, you might end up in a situation where in fact, what you’ve done is made the map lean a little more Democratic than it otherwise would have been. If you stand down, if you elect us into a majority, we will pass a bill outlawing partisan gerrymandering, which in addition to I think being smart politics is just the right thing to do. But, I mean, the people in Texas, if you talk to them, are like, we can’t afford to just stand down at this point because they have taken this fight national and Republicans have no concerns about blowing through good government guardrails or anything like this. If you believe the latter, then I can understand the hesitation about wanting to abandon nonpartisan redistricting commissions and that kind of thing, because it feels like a retreat from ideals of fairness and good government. Then I think it leads you, inevitably to the conclusion that those people who are interested in actually fair elections have to do what it takes now to win the power to pass laws to ensure fair elections. And then hopefully, as Jamelle said, if we Democrats and I’m a Democrat can get back in power and can pass some laws to bring this to a better place, then that is the most optimistic scenario I can see. To build on that, I think that the best case scenario does involve Democrats nationally recognizing that the only way past this moment in our politics, past Trumpism, you might say, is through serious political reform. So I want to jump on that because I actually spent some time down in Austin, and I’ve talked to a lot of the Democrats who’ve been watching this thing down there for a long time. The people were lining up and in the Capitol to testify and the other arenas where they were having these things, people were lining up online to testify they had overflow rooms. Well, I mean, you got to I think it’s worth saying that public opinion is in a kind of dialectical relationship with actual politicians and that the baseline state of public opinion is they don’t like gerrymandering, but it may not be the most salient thing. And I think that if Democrats say to themselves, Oh, well, I don’t know if we can mobilize voters to care about this, I think they’re just not they’re not trying hard enough. And I would have to say the Democrats don’t come to this with absolutely clean hands, because back in 2022, they redistricted in the state of New York and the courts threw it out, claimed it was too partisan, and the court drew the boundaries for that election. So I think the American public finds all of this really complicated, confusing, and has a hard time figuring out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. So like Jamelle, I think this could be, once they get through this immediate response and how to deal with Texas specifically, it would be nice if this could go back on the table as a nationwide issue of reform. I would have never predicted that some of the nominees, some of the manifestly unqualified nominees that he put forward, Pete Hegseth, just to pick a name, would have gotten confirmed by the Senate. If the Republicans are willing to sit back and allow him to fire the head of the BLS, allow him, ironically, to weaponize the Justice Department after attacking Biden for so-called weaponizing the Justice Department, then I’m not sure what short of one of those two things I mentioned, is going to cause the Republicans to push back in any kind of major way. It would be surprising if it was a midterm Wipeout, but even if it were a midterm Wipeout, I think we’re in this weird zone where Republican lawmakers are not just politically afraid of upsetting Trump, but they are physically afraid for their safety. Which kind of brings me to where I want to wrap this up, which is that he is a lame duck president, as you point out, unless he totally blows up the Constitution, he’ll be gone in another few years. And if you buy that there’s such a thing as a moral ecology to a society, then Trump has influenced the moral ecology of American politics in such a way as to make the kind of open and explicit corruption and casual and open bigotry, all these things to make them common again in American political life. And so I love this view that there will be tangible policy things from the Trump era that may not last beyond Trump, that may not last beyond the personnel associated with them. But I started my career, as I said at the times Washington Bureau in June of 1974, and of course, in August of 1974, Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford got on television and said, we are a nation of laws and not of men. It’s possible that whatever’s left of the moderate wing of the Republican Party, and I will absolutely grant you that he’s driven most of them out of power and out of office, will reassert itself.

Article: Monochronic people “tend to live by the clock and are primed, at least during work hours, to prioritize obligations over relationships.” Polychronic people, on the other hand, “tend to give primacy to experiences and relationships that don’t always fit neatly into prearranged schedules.” If you prefer to work on one thing at a time, emphasizing deadlines and seeing interruptions as irritating, you’re monochronic. While I want to be productive, I want so much more to prioritize relationships over industry, to say “this can wait” when I’m fast at work and someone calls with last-minute theater tickets. My monochronic preference for uninterrupted stretches of time in which to work — oh, the exquisite relief of turning on “Do Not Disturb” on my laptop and knowing that it will also silence my phone, my iPad, the text alerts and weather alerts and news alerts and calendar alerts! I tell myself that nothing will feel as good as getting things done, but then I think of the cliché about people on their deathbeds never saying they wish they’d spent more time working. “If your goal is to complete a task, then we need to be monochronic for a window of time and shut out all distractions.” While switching gears may feel uncomfortable for those of us conditioned to do the thing until the thing is done, this framing highlights the stakes.

Article: Webster looks on during the commemoration of the bloodiest events in the Bureau's history on the 25th anniversary of a Miami shootout in which two agents were killed, in North Miami Beach, Fla., April 11, 2011. Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

(Peter Meecham/AAP Image via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The leaders of New Zealand and Australia on Saturday discussed closer cooperation between their expanding militaries against the backdrop of a recent extraordinary Chinese live-fire exercise near their shores. “We want to be one, sort of, essential Anzac force essentially operating within our region,” he added, referring to the Australian New Zealand Army Corps in which the two nations’ soldiers first fought together during World War I. Albanese said last month that he complained to China’s President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing about the lack of notice the Chinese had given of the live-fire exercise. Albanese and Luxon recognized their countries face the most unpredictable and dangerous strategic environment in decades and their alliance plays a critical role in protecting and advancing their shared interest in the region, they said in a joint statement. “We genuinely are able to have a conversation — I think a very mature one now — to say, look, we do have very different histories, we do have different systems, we do have different values, that does mean we do have differences. He described the rise from around 1% over the past two decades as “a big step up for us.” In a demonstration of Tokyo seeking deeper strategic ties in the South Pacific, Japanese warships docked in New Zealand on Friday for the first time in almost 90 years.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before walking across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Aug. (AP) — An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year. It was not clear what basis exists to contend that Smith's investigations were political in nature or that he violated the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, had earlier this week encouraged the office to scrutinize Smith's activities and had alleged that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president Kamala Harris, both Democrats. Smith brought two cases against Trump, one accusing him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the other of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both were brought in 2023, well over a year before the 2024 presidential election, and indictments in the two cases cited what Smith and his team described as clear violations of well-established federal law. There was no immediate indication that the same office investigating Smith had opened investigations into the Justice Department special counsels who were appointed by Garland to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Trump selected as his replacement Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host who has praised criminally charged influencer Andrew Tate as a “extraordinary human being” and promoted the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged.

Here are some things to know: Trump wants to redraw the Texas congressional map in hopes of adding five more GOP seats in Texas in the midterm elections to boost his party's chance of preserving its slim U.S. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics during the president's second term, had been in quiet talks with Texas Democrats for weeks about offering support if they chose to leave the state. Greg Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court, which is entirely controlled by GOP justices, to remove the Democratic House leader from office through an untested legal argument that the absent legislators have effectively forfeited their seats. In 2021, the Texas Supreme Court held that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year in a similar quorum break. 20, Abbott has the authority to keep calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for 30-day special sessions to pass the redistricting bill and any other item he believes should be addressed.

Claire's Chapter 11 filing follows the bankruptcies of other teen retailers including Forever 21, which filed in March for bankruptcy protection for a second time and eventually closed down its U.S. Claire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois and founded in 1974, said that its stores in North America will remain open and will continue to serve customers, while it explores all strategic alternatives. “Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire’s and its stakeholders.” Like many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, noted in a note published Wednesday Claire's bankruptcy filing comes as “no real surprise.” “The chain has been swamped by a cocktail of problems, both internal and external, that made it impossible to stay afloat,” he wrote.

Article: A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity. But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges — until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations. Will you marry me?” Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva — whom he met in 2021 — that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity. Any small stimulus — a smell, a breeze, a color — can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv. "It just feels less intense.” A 2014 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Israeli ex-POWs and combat veterans tracked over 35 years had higher mortality rates, chronic illnesses and worse self-rated health — conditions partly tied to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.

Article: (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) NEW YORK -- The 17 experts who were ousted from a government vaccine committee last month say they have little faith in what the panel has become, and have outlined possible alternative ways to make U.S. In a commentary published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former panel members wrote that Kennedy — a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders. The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's “destabilizing decisions." The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy’s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.” Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations.

Article: To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an x-ray, an ultrasound machine, and a bone density scanner -- all owned by the town. "This is important for our community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, "in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important." According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents. Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors -- by 2035. "This is a huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community." In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here. "It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends." Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said. "We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before," he said, "and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on." Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. He was kind of a different kind of physician." Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a 3-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June. Camron Browning, MD, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist. "My goal," he said, "was to be able to come home and serve my hometown." Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice. After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency. "This was always my dream."

Article: Kennedy Jr.'s statements before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday revealed a concerning lack of knowledge about the major health programs he'd oversee, should he be confirmed as HHS secretary. The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are narrow." In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income. Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program." He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues -- who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is "fully paid for by the federal government," when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees. Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be "rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges." "He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with," Benjamin said. Also, "he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true." Benjamin was asked -- given the number of Kennedy's misstatements -- whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles. [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does." Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite a few instances of disinformation." Multiple times, he suggested "that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll." Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, "Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID." Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations -- which he now denies -- raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.

Article: A western New York health insurance provider for seniors and the CEO of its medical analytics arm have agreed to pay a total of up to $100 million to settle Justice Department allegations of fraudulent billing for health conditions that were exaggerated or didn't exist. "Today's result sends a clear message to the Medicare Advantage community that the United States will take appropriate action against those who knowingly submit inflated claims for reimbursement," Michael Granston, a Department of Justice (DOJ) deputy assistant attorney general, said in announcing the settlement on December 20. This settlement is not an admission of any wrongdoing; it instead allows us to avoid the further disruption, expense, and uncertainty of litigation in a matter that has lingered for over a decade." Under the settlement, Independent Health will make "guaranteed payments" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement "historic," saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. Ross said that CMS "created a bounty" for health plans that added medical diagnosis codes as they reviewed patients' charts -- and whether those codes were accurate or not "didn't seem to bother some people." "Billions of dollars are being paid out by CMS for diagnoses that don't exist," Ross told KFF Health News in an interview. DxID specialized in mining electronic medical records to capture new diagnoses for patients -- pocketing up to 20% of the money it generated for the health plan, according to the suit, which said Independent Health used the firm from 2010 through 2017. "There is no upfront fee, we don't get paid until you get paid and we work on a percentage of the actual proven recoveries," Gaffney said, according to the complaint. The settlement simply resolves a dispute and provides closure to the parties." 'A Ton of Money' CMS uses a complex formula that pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients and less for people in good health. Independent Health violated those rules by billing Medicare for a range of medical conditions that either were exaggerated or not supported by patient medical files, such as billing for treating chronic depression that had been resolved, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Gaffney said renal failure diagnoses were "worth a ton of money to IH [Independent Health] and the majority of people (over) 70 have it at some level." Ross filed the whistleblower case in 2012 against Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, one of the nation's oldest managed-care groups. Ross, a former medical coding manager there, alleged that DxID submitted more than $30 million in disease claims -- many of which were not valid -- on behalf of Group Health for 2010 and 2011. For instance, Ross alleged that the plan billed for "major depression" in a patient described by his doctor as having an "amazingly sunny disposition." Group Health, now known as the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, denied wrongdoing. Ross, 60, said she is now "happily retired." False Claims Whistleblowers sue under the False Claims Act, a federal law dating to the Civil War that allows private citizens to expose fraud against the government and share in any recovery. At least two dozen such suits, some dating to 2009, have targeted Medicare Advantage plans for overstating the severity of medical conditions, a practice known in the industry as "upcoding." Previous settlements from such suits have totaled more than $600 million. In a surprise action in late January 2023, CMS announced that it would settle for a fraction of the estimated tens of millions of dollars in overpayments uncovered through its audits dating to 2011 and not impose major financial penalties on health plans until a round of audits for 2018 payments, which have yet to be done.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File) LOS ANGELES -- Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station’s empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy “WKRP in Cincinnati,” died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday. Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynold s in the 1983 comedy “Stroker Ace,” and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before their messy breakup in 1994. Their son, Quinton Reynolds, was “the best decision that we ever made in our entire relationship,” she said during the unveiling of a bronze bust at Reynolds’ Hollywood grave site in 2021. Anderson detailed their tumultuous marriage in the 1995 autobiography, “My Life in High Heels,” which she said was about “the growth of a woman, a woman who survives." “I think if you’re going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,” Anderson told the AP while promoting the book. Most of her career was spent on the small screen with early guest parts in the 1970s on “S.W.A.T.” and “Police Woman.” After “WKRP,” Anderson starred in the short-lived comedy series “Easy Street” and appeared in made-for-TV movies including “A Letter to Three Wives” and “White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd.” In 2023 she co-starred in Lifetime’s “Ladies Of The 80s: A Divas Christmas” with Linda Gray, Donna Mills, Morgan Fairchild and Nicollette Sheridan. I’m just devastated to hear this." Anderson is survived by Flick, her daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.

(Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) — Comic-Con got a lot of Ryan and a little bit of Rocky at a panel on “Project: Hail Mary,” the forthcoming film that's equal parts space adventure, real-science deep-dive, broad comedy and relationship drama. “If the universe depended on it,” Miller said, “can adult men make friends?” Rocky is already a cult favorite for readers of Andy Weir’s novel, and is sure to be a future staple of Comic-Con cosplay. Weir, who was part of the panel, chimed in: “From Emma Stone, to person of stone.” The film is adapted by screenwriter Drew Goddard, who also wrote the script for the 2015 Matt Damon movie “The Martian,” based on Weir's first novel. Gosling said he got on board the ship immediately after reading “Project Hail Mary” in manuscript form, and was only partly kidding when he called Weir, who was sitting next to him, “the greatest sci-fi mind of our time.” “I knew it would be brilliant, because it’s Andy, but nothing could prepare me,” Gosling said. “It took me places I’d never been, it showed me things I’d never seen, it was as heartbreaking as it was funny.” Gosling plays Ryland Grace, a middle school teacher and underachiever drafted for the mission. He gives a mealymouthed scream of “Where am ?!” When the lights came up in the room, Gosling said that he'd looked in the scene like a “space caveman” in a “placenta onesie.” The movie represents the return to directing, and return to space, of Lord and Miller for the first time since they were fired and replaced by Ron Howard by Disney and Lucasfilm from 2018’s “Solo.” Like, “The Martian,” the movie goes heavy on the science — Weir, also a producer, said he spent hours going over every equation one very white board.

'Significant volume' of EV sales Consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest monthly sales tally on record, behind roughly 136,000 sold in December, according to Cox Automotive data. (This comes as Tesla's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters, by about 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 9% in Q1, according to Cox data.) $7,500 tax credit puts EVs near price parity The tax credits — worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — aim to make EV purchases more financially enticing for consumers.

Article: James 'Jim' Arthur Lovell Jr., (born March 25, 1928) is a former NASA astronaut and a retired captain in the United States Navy, most famous as the commander of the Apollo 13 mission. "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements." One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame — thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission — immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell — that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: government is loathe to admit it, but economists say it's highly likely that the Treasury will have to hike taxes in the fall if it is to bung a black hole in the public finances that it has effectively created for itself. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the latest economic think tank to warn that taxes would have to rise later this year if British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules." These rules target both a balanced or budget surplus by the end of the decade — with the so-called "stability rule" requiring that day-to-day spending is funded by tax revenues rather than borrowing — and that debt, as a proportion of GDP, should be falling by the end of this parliament (in 2029-30), aka the "investment rule." "The Government is not on track to meet its 'stability rule', with our forecast suggesting a current deficit of £41.2 billion in the fiscal year 2029-30," NIESR said in an economic outlook released Wednesday. With the government having fixed its spending plans for the next couple of years in its recent Spending Review, "the only lever available is to raise taxation in a moderate but sustained way," the think tank said in the report titled "the Chancellor's Trilemma." The 'trilemma' refers to the bind Reeves finds herself in thanks to her own fiscal rules, tax and spending commitments made over the last year and the Labour Party's manifesto promise to not raise taxes on "working people." "Simply put, the Chancellor cannot simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments, and uphold manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people.

Article: Voyager Technologies clinched a $3.8 billion valuation two months ago, as the defense and space company's stock opened 125% higher on Wednesday at $69.75 apiece, above its $31 offer price. On Thursday, Northrop Grumman-backed Firefly Aerospace — whose Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down on the Moon earlier this year — surged in its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol FLY. This might seem like a small step for some industries, but it's a giant leap for traditional offerings for the space sector, where for some time players such as Intuitive Machines, Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile listed by way of mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) — shell firms that pool their IPO proceeds to consolidate with a private company and take it public, bypassing some of the typical regulatory scrutiny. But recent geopolitical volatility triggered by the conflict in the Middle East and by Washington's protectionist trade policies have cast a shadow over global appetite for dealmaking and going public, bankers have mentioned anecdotally. "Companies aligned with national priorities and innovation, and those able to present a credible equity story with realistic valuations and flexible timing, are likely to succeed in navigating this complex environment." Space companies, by definition, tick at least some of those boxes. Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPOX, qualified this is "definitely a good time for Space IPOs," with initiatives like the U.S.' push for the Golden Dome missile interception system fueling high valuations. "Still, most firms in the sector are dependent on foreign-made satellite components, creating a vulnerability to cost increases and deployment delays caused by trade disputes." He nevertheless warned that the "intensifying" competition in the private launch market — where companies are looking to reduce costs, particularly by deploying reusable tech and infrastructure — could create "downward pressure on costs." "This will be a key factor in lowering the sector's high entry barriers, making a new generation of space-based business models commercially feasible," Muehlbauer noted. These companies are not being valued on near-term cash flow, but on their ability to deliver long-term strategic infrastructure," Cristiano Dalla Bona, who heads North America ECM analysis at Mergermarket, said in emailed comments. Still, the credibility and visibility on growth of each new candidate will likely be scrutinized." The sector has also been firmly in the public eye, with headlines ranging from NASA layoffs, Elon Musk's vocal involvement with — and later explosive exit from — the White House and Trump's push for the Golden Dome missile interception system.

Trump said that he expects new U.S. "So can't tell you exactly when, but I want to be around a year from now." Apple on Wednesday said it created the so-called American Manufacturing Program that includes Corning , Coherent , GlobalWafers, Applied Materials , Texas Instruments , Samsung, GlobalFoundries , Amkor and Broadcom . "President Trump shared some kind words about that work, but he also asked us to think about what more we could commit to doing," Cook said about Apple's earlier initial $500 billion commitment. President, we took that challenge very seriously." Trump has criticized Apple and Cook for not making its smartphones in the U.S., a move that Apple has never signaled that it is likely to make. "If you look at the bulk of it, we're doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we're doing the glass here, we're doing the face ID module here," Cook said. Trump said on Wednesday that he planned to impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors and chips, but that Apple was exempt because it is committing to build in the U.S. are assembled in India to avoid Chinese tariffs, and although tariffs on India are going up to 25%, White House sources told CNBC that the iPhone maker will be "largely unaffected" by the India tariffs.

Thailand Thailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said in a post on X that the tariff rate levied on the country "reflects the close friendship and partnership between Thailand and the United States," according to a Google translation of his statement in Thai. However, he said that the government recognizes the impact of the tariffs on entrepreneurs and farmers, and has prepared "comprehensive support measures," including soft loans, subsidies, and tax measures so as to help Thailand adapt. Taiwan will also discuss supply chain cooperation and issues related to Section 232 in the future, he added, referring to the sectoral tariffs that Trump had imposed on national security grounds. 1] general tariff rate will ease and not burden our economy," according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Malay He also confirmed that Trump would be attending the 47th ASEAN summit in October, being held in Malaysia. "What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market," he said, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to local media, the country's Trade Minister Todd McClay said it seemed as though the tariff rates were targeting countries that have trade deficits with the U.S., but that the size of it was "really not significant or meaningful" in New Zealand's case. "Many of the exporters are saying they have been able to absorb the 10 percent, or in many cases pass it on, but at 15 percent it is going to start having a greater effect on our exporters," he said. On social media platform X, the country's federal council, said it noted "with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." "Switzerland has been and remains in contact with the relevant US authorities. "While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong," he said.

Article: Philip Fong | Afp | Getty Images Visitor interest in Japan plunged in June, amid a prophecy in a manga that predicted a "disaster" would strike Japan in July 2025. The prediction was in a 2021 reprint of a Japanese comic book, or manga, titled "Watashi ga Mita Mirai, Kanzenban" (which translates to "The Future That I Saw, Complete Edition") by artist Ryo Tatsuki. In the original printing of the book in 1999, the cover page referenced a "disaster in March 2011." In March 2011, Japan suffered its most powerful earthquake on record, the Great Tohoku Earthquake, which caused almost 20,000 deaths and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG told CNBC that the rumor was widely circulated in Hong Kong, where it spread over mainstream media, TV networks and through YouTube influencers. "This is the first time we've seen such an incident." Hong Kong and Japanese media reported earlier in July that Hong Kong airlines cut flights to some Japanese cities, including Nagoya. A January report from Japan's Asahi Shimbun, citing the country's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, also warned that the likelihood of a megaquake in the next 30 years had risen to 80%—a development that, combined with the prediction, created a "perfect storm" to deter travelers, Yuen said. However, Japan's Meteorological Agency said: "It should be noted that the issuance of information indicating elevated potential for a Nankai Trough earthquake does not necessarily mean that one will actually strike." Asian tourists more affected than Western ones JNTO data showed that the share of Asian tourists fell year on year in June, but that of Western countries rose.

Article: When I met with Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal just last week, he told me that talks were "progressing extremely well" and that he was confident India would secure a "preferential tariff compared to our peers and our competitors." Blueprint with Britain The acrimony with Washington, though, is a world away from the positive mood surrounding the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement concluded with the U.K. will eliminate tariffs on 99% of all Indian goods, up from about 73% currently, making the effective tariff rate for Indian exporters close to zero, according to the team led by Sajjid Chinoy, JPMorgan's chief India economist. "It's a proper strategic partnership for the future now." Some friction persists Despite the comprehensive nature of the agreement, the final deal does not include an exemption for India from the U.K.'s carbon tax, which is set to begin in 2027. Goyal said India would oppose any such measures, which he characterized as "non-tariff barriers." "India will continue to explore every option that's available to us under the World Trade Organisation to stop such measures from hurting trade between the two countries," Goyal said. "We are always very sensitive to the interests of our farmers, the interests of our [Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises], and will ensure that our areas of concern are well protected," Goyal said.

Article: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images Come Friday, the world will have to contend with higher tariff rates from the Trump administration, raising the specter of even more economic uncertainty. Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done "over 200 deals" in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that "90 deals in 90 days" was possible. Vietnam: tariffs more than halved Vietnam was the second to cross the line with the Trump administration, with Trump announcing a trade agreement on July 2 that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slashed from 46% to 20%. One point with Vietnam was a 40% "transshipping" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S, although it is not clear how this will be applied. Philippines: marginal decrease Unlike its ASEAN counterparts above, which had sizable reductions to its tariff duties, the Philippines saw a decrease of a single percentage point to 19% from 20% on July 22. goods as part of the agreement, according to Trump, who praised the country for what he described as "going OPEN MARKET with the United States." In addition, Trump also said that the Philippines will work together "Militarily," without specifying any details. after China, seeing its tariff rate cut to 15% from 25% on July 23, and being the first economy to see a lower preferential tariff rate for its key automobile sector. would "receive 90% of the Profits." The path to this agreement was fraught with uncertainty, with Trump saying days before the agreement that he did not expect the two countries to reach a deal. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou went as far as saying it was an act of "submission" and a "dark day." EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, however, called it "the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances." South Korea: also at 15% South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement, on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "90% of the profits" from that $350 billion investment will be "going to the American people." However, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the $350 billion fund will play a role in facilitating the "active entry" of Korean companies into the U.S. It was initially hit with a 34% tariff from "Liberation Day," before a series of back-and-forth measures between the two sides saw the duties skyrocket to 145% duties for Chinese imports to the U.S. For countries without a deal, it appears that a higher global baseline tariff of about 15%-20% will be slapped on them, according to Trump, higher than the 10% baseline announced on "Liberation Day." Countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. India: tariffs and a penalty On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on India, with an additional unspecified "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. "While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what Trump imposed on India on "Liberation Day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner, but at the high end of the 20%-25% range that the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that the partners were in an "intense phase" of talks, noting that it would be unlikely for an agreement not to include any tariffs, Reuters reported.

Article: First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re Andy Palmer The emergence of CAT bonds as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In just the last few weeks, Greece has been battling major wildfires across the country, temperatures notched a national record of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in neighboring Turkey, destructive and deadly flooding took place in Texas and climate change triggered record-breaking heat in Iceland and Greenland. 'Astronomical growth' Alongside increasing usage of the CAT bond market by insurers and reinsurers, it is thought that the portfolio diversification benefits of these bonds has helped to drive a surge in investor interest. Reinsurance company Swiss Re said in a report published Wednesday that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down. Andy Palmer, head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, said "astronomical growth" had helped to push the size of the CAT bond market to nearly $56 billion in the first half of the year. "One of the statements that historically was made to me in the past when I talked about CAT bond market growth was 'oh yeah, but it's the same guys just doing bigger deals.

Article: LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Thursday said that Microsoft and Amazon are hurting competition in the cloud computing industry and called for a probe into their market dominance under the country's strict new tech rules. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power" and reap financial gain exceeding the cost of capital expenditure over a sustained period. Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have built huge businesses by offering access to computing resources — such as data storage and processing — via the internet using data centers, large facilities that contain dedicated hardware. The CMA is concerned that certain practices within the space, such as egress fees and unfavorable licensing terms, are creating a "lock-in" effect where businesses are getting trapped into contractual agreements that are difficult to get out of. Microsoft said the regulator's decision "misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes." "Its recommendations fail to cover Google, one of the fastest-growing cloud market participants," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. Amazon also disputed the CMA's findings and said recommendations for a fresh probe into the two tech giants' dominance of cloud were "unwarranted." "It risks making the UK a global outlier at a time when businesses need regulatory predictability for the UK to maintain international competitiveness," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. Swift action will be "essential to ensure British businesses pay a fair price and to unleash choice, innovation and economic growth in teh U.K.," Chris Lindsay, Google's vice president of customer engineering for EMEA, said in a statement.

During this period, firms are limited to holding only £50,000 of total customer deposits — well below the hundreds of billions of pounds customers deposit with major high street lenders such as Barclays , HSBC and Santander . Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported Tuesday that a meeting arranged by British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves with Revolut and the PRA was cancelled after an intervention from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. "Revolut is already a regulated bank in over 30 countries, including some of the toughest jurisdictions in the world," he told CNBC, noting the company is worth more than some major U.K banks on a rumored $65 billion valuation . Regulators are nervous about getting it wrong due to the lingering "scar tissue" of the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fraud prevention platform Sardine AI.

Article: Conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch will give President Donald Trump regular updates on his health as part of an agreement to postpone Murdoch's deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him over a Wall Street Journal article about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday. "Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health," the filing says.

Days after reporting that the goods trade deficit tumbled 10.8% to its lowest since September 2023, the government said the full deficit including services also was its narrowest since then. The economy in the second quarter expanded at a 3.0% annualized rate after contracting at a 0.5% rate in the first three months of the year, but the headline figure masked underlying indications that activity was weakening.

Article: Brazil's Supreme Court put former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday ahead of his trial for an alleged coup plot, underscoring the court's resolve despite escalating tariffs and sanctions from U.S. In an interview with Reuters last month, Bolsonaro called Moraes a "dictator" and said the restraining orders against him were acts of "cowardice." Some Bolsonaro allies have worried that Trump's tactics may be backfiring in Brazil, compounding trouble for Bolsonaro and rallying public support behind Lula's leftist government. However, Sunday demonstrations by Bolsonaro supporters — the largest in months — show that Trump's tirades and sanctions against Moraes have also fired up the far-right former army captain's political base. Bolsonaro appeared virtually at a protest in Rio de Janeiro via phone call to his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, in what some saw as the latest test of his restraining orders. sanctions against the judge, adding: "I hope the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this person (Moraes) causing so much upheaval." The judge's orders, including the restraining orders under penalty of arrest, have been upheld by the wider court. Those orders and the larger case before the Supreme Court came after two years of investigations into Bolsonaro's role in an election-denying movement that culminated in riots by his supporters that rocked Brasilia in January 2023. In contrast with the tangle of criminal cases which mostly stalled against Trump, Brazilian courts moved swiftly against Bolsonaro, threatening to end his political career and fracture his right-wing movement. In a statement after the arrest on Monday, Congressman Bolsonaro called Moraes "an out-of-control psychopath who never hesitates to double down." Trump last month shared a letter he had sent to Bolsonaro. The arrest could give Trump a pretext to pile on additional measures against Brazil, said Graziella Testa, a political science professor at the Federal University of Parana, adding that Bolsonaro seemed to be consciously provoking escalation. "I think things could escalate because this will be seen as a reaction to the Magnitsky sanction" against Moraes, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner at the Think Policy political risk consultancy in Brasilia, referring to the asset freeze imposed on Moraes last week.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S.

Article: The EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website . Landlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away," said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform. Cambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists. "It's a $32 million program for the government, but it provides, in terms of return on investment — it's huge," said Nicole Upano, director of public policy for the NAA. "It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program." If Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In response at the time, the company said it stands "by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program." In July, the Journal also reported that the DOJ interviewed several doctors about UnitedHealth's practices and whether they felt pressured to submit claims for certain conditions that bolstered payments from the Medicare Advantage program to the company.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety "I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years." Cree, who is also a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. In a recent survey of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter. Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar." Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s. "All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a recent survey from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.

The following year, the agency granted the treatment full approval for patients 4 and older who could still walk and accelerated approval for patients 4 and up who could no longer walk. Executives this week tried to reassure investors that even if it can only treat patients who can still walk, where deaths haven't been reported, the therapy should bring in at least $500 million a year.

Though the pace of hiring is well off where it stood last year, the June total was the best since March and consistent with a slowing but still fairly vibrant jobs picture. "Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient." The report follows months of concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would hold back economic growth and stymie consumer spending.

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Article: "The new EU tariff of 15% means that UK exports to the US have become relatively cheaper, which could boost British trade with the US as American firms buy goods from Britain rather than the EU," he explained. consumers due to the lower tariff rate, meaning they may favor British products over those manufactured in the EU, Alex Altmann, partner and head of Lubbock Fine LLP's German desk, suggested in a note published shortly after the EU-U.S. "The UK's lower US tariffs do offer a major incentive for EU companies to shift some of their manufacturing bases to the UK or to expand their existing UK facilities," he added. Here the UK benefits from its major trading partner averting a recession which could have resulted in a decline in UK exports to the EU," he said in written comments. "If the US had proceeded with 30% tariffs against most EU goods, UK goods with a 10% tariff, which is paid by the US importer in most circumstances, could have appeared significantly more attractive," she said.

Article: President Donald Trump talks to the media as he meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (not pictured) at Trump Turnberry golf club on July 28, 2025 in Turnberry, Scotland. tariffs on incoming goods look to be settling in only slightly less than what President Donald Trump had threatened in April, but the difference has been enough to ease some of Wall Street's worst recession fears. With the U.S.-European Union trade deal over the weekend, it now appears that the effective tariff rate, or the net impact aside from the nominal level, will end up in the 15%-20% range. That's well above the low single-digit rate in place at the beginning of the year, but well off the feared 25% rate or worse that could have happened as a result of the April 2 announcement. Tariffs still a danger Commentary around Wall Street following the U.S-EU deal for 15% tariffs echoed the belief that the recession risk had dimmed, even if tariffs still have the strong potential to exert a stifling impact on growth. "We still believe the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation: Not a recession, but a backdrop where the adverse effects of trade and immigration controls on growth outweigh the boost from deregulation and fiscal largesse," Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Zezas wrote. economy skewing toward a slowdown, but with more clarity on the fiscal situation and deficits now front-loaded, the risk of a substantial recession is easing." The U.S.-Europe deal will give the Federal Reserve more to chew on this week when it discusses the impact that tariffs will have on inflation. Since Trump has taken office, the Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate steady, in large part because policymakers are cautious over the impact tariffs will have on inflation. The Fed is expected to approve a rate cut in September, and the chances of that happening seemingly would increase if the economy weakens while inflation is held in check. "But with major trading partner tariffs stabilizing closer to 15% than the much higher rates proposed on April 2, markets and Fed officials will be increasingly confident that the drag on growth and upside risk to inflation will be modest."

Article: "I got that to mean that I think he's going to start recommending lower rates." Powell and his fellow policymakers have been reluctant to lower rates as they wait to see the impact Trump's tariffs have on inflation. Prior to Trump's remarks, White House budget director Russell Vought kept up the heat on the Fed's renovation project, pushing the case for a review of the central bank while pressing for lower interest rates. "There's a whole host of issues with regard to the Fed, and we want to make sure that those questions get answered over time," Vought said during the "Squawk Box" appearance. "This is not a pressure campaign on the Fed chairman." The tone following Thursday's meeting was more conciliatory after months — and even years — of rancor between the Trump White House and the Powell Fed. Both sides characterized the tour as positive, with a Fed official releasing a statement Friday saying the central bank was "honored" to welcome Trump as well as other Republican officials.

Article: Horacio Villalobos | Corbis News | Getty Images The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates steady amid major economic uncertainty, as the European Union scrambles to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.S. "The environment remains exceptionally uncertain, especially because of trade disputes," the ECB said in a statement, adding that its inflation and growth outlook from June remained supported by recent data. While annual inflation in the euro area hit the central bank's 2% target last month, traders widely expected a hold in July — in large part due to geopolitical volatility. As of Thursday, the future of that trade relationship remained up in the air, with one possibility being a 15% baseline tariff rate on all EU imports to the U.S., along with retaliatory measures on the EU's part. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane told CNBC earlier this month that "the last cycle is done, bringing inflation down," but that policymakers would remain alert to any changes in the medium-term outlook. Growth risks 'tilted to downside' In a news conference following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the euro zone economy had performed better than expected in the first quarter. Stressing current levels of uncertainty in forecasting, Lagarde went on to say that risks to growth were "tilted to the downside," with an escalation in trade tensions potentially dragging down exports, investment and consumption, as well as weighing on business and household sentiment. Lagarde noted Thursday that a stronger euro could "bring inflation down further than expected" and that higher global tariffs could concurrently dampen price rises, if countries with overcapacity reroute their exports to the euro area. That is still up from a rate of around $1.026 at the start of the year, as investors have broadly shifted away from the greenback due to political and fiscal uncertainty. Higher fiscal spending and extreme weather events also risk an uptick in inflation, she said, describing the current situation as "wait and watch" but policy overall as in a "good place."

Article: Recycling the metal also consumes only 5% of the energy it takes to produce the same amount of primary aluminum through a smelter, making it more environmentally friendly, according to the International Aluminium Institute, a trade association. That has provided a windfall for some domestic producers but has pushed up costs through the supply chain, with downstream users like PepsiCo and Campbell Soup facing price hikes on everything from beverage cans to tinplate steel. The United States, which until recently exported about 2 million tonnes of scrap annually , has begun to export much less, partly because of the lack of supply but also because of diversion to feed local recycling capacity. "There is a clear incentive to export scrap from Europe to the U.S.," said Hydro's Christophersen, though he noted that volatility in the transatlantic trade environment is limiting those flows. "We're not seeing a lot of scrap exports [from Europe at the moment] because the trade environment is so volatile and are fully dependent on where Europe ends up when it comes to tariff [with] the U.S.," he added. A compelling business case Building a new recycling facility requires only about 10% of the capital expenditure and can be completed in one to two years, less than the five-to-six-year timeline for a traditional smelter.

(Netflix via AP) This image released by Netflix shows characters, from left, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira in a scene from "KPop Demon Hunters." (Netflix via AP) NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of “KPop Demon Hunters,” everyone is a fan. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 — empowered girl groups used as references for the film’s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X. They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys’ hit song “Soda Pop,” for example, references the ’90s K-pop group H.O.T. She considers “Kpop Demon Hunters” to be “a musical with songs inspired by K-pop,” not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for “Mamma Mia.” The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. “If you don’t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.” Zabrinah Santiago, a San Diego-based longtime K-pop fan and freelance illustrator who goes by ItmeZ online, was so inspired by the animation style of the movie that she raced to make fan art. She sold illustrated fan cards of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys at her booth at the Los Angeles Anime Expo, held in July, two weeks after the movie was released on Netflix. Kang says for “KPop Demon Hunters,” her team wanted to bring together demons and Jeoseung Saja — the grim reaper in Korean mythology — for a film that could look both very traditional and modernized — what she says is common in K-dramas but not in animation. “It’s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.” Santiago was initially skeptical of the title “KPop Demon Hunters.” “I feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. “But I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.” Indeed — if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin.

(AP Photo/Janvier Barhahiga , File) KINSHASA, Congo -- Rwanda-backed rebels have killed at least 80 people in eastern Congo in recent weeks, Congolese authorities said, despite the ongoing Qatar-led peace process aiming to end the conflict. The army said in a statement late Friday that it is “fiercely condemning a series of mass murders of civilians by the RDF/M23-AFC coalition" in South Kivu, including of 80 people on Aug. human rights chief said that M23 killed 319 people over the past month in a different part of the region, describing the toll as one of the largest documented in such attacks since the M23 rebels resurfaced in 2022. human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the rebels, backed by members of the Rwandan Defense Force, targeted four villages in North Kivu province’s Rutshuru territory between July 9 and July 21. “We call for the opening of an independent investigation and hope that the organizations that published this report can participate in it.” The M23 earlier this year seized two key cities in eastern Congo, in a major escalation with the help of neighboring Rwandan forces. The two sides on July 19 signed a declaration of principles in Qatar to end the fighting and commit to a comprehensive peace agreement that would include the restoration of state authorities in key eastern cities controlled by the insurgents.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.” “Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.
