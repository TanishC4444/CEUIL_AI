Article: Nvidia has denied that its chips have any "backdoors" that would allow anyone to access or control them, after Chinese regulators summoned officials from the company to explain risks associated with its H20 chip. While Nvidia was given assurances by Washington that it would be allowed to resume exports of its made-for-China H20 general processing units, the AI chips have attracted increased scrutiny from Beijing. According to the Cyberspace Administration of China, Nvidia met with Beijing officials on Thursday regarding national security concerns posed by the H20 chips, which are expected to resume shipments to China following an effective ban in April. Nvidia was requested "to clarify and submit relevant supporting documentation regarding security risks, including potential vulnerabilities and backdoors, associated with its H20 computing chips sold to China," according to a CNBC translation of a statement from CAC.

Article: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images Come Friday, the world will have to contend with higher tariff rates from the Trump administration, raising the specter of even more economic uncertainty. Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done "over 200 deals" in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that "90 deals in 90 days" was possible. Vietnam: tariffs more than halved Vietnam was the second to cross the line with the Trump administration, with Trump announcing a trade agreement on July 2 that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slashed from 46% to 20%. One point with Vietnam was a 40% "transshipping" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S, although it is not clear how this will be applied. Philippines: marginal decrease Unlike its ASEAN counterparts above, which had sizable reductions to its tariff duties, the Philippines saw a decrease of a single percentage point to 19% from 20% on July 22. goods as part of the agreement, according to Trump, who praised the country for what he described as "going OPEN MARKET with the United States." In addition, Trump also said that the Philippines will work together "Militarily," without specifying any details. after China, seeing its tariff rate cut to 15% from 25% on July 23, and being the first economy to see a lower preferential tariff rate for its key automobile sector. would "receive 90% of the Profits." The path to this agreement was fraught with uncertainty, with Trump saying days before the agreement that he did not expect the two countries to reach a deal. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou went as far as saying it was an act of "submission" and a "dark day." EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, however, called it "the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances." South Korea: also at 15% South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement, on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "90% of the profits" from that $350 billion investment will be "going to the American people." However, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the $350 billion fund will play a role in facilitating the "active entry" of Korean companies into the U.S. It was initially hit with a 34% tariff from "Liberation Day," before a series of back-and-forth measures between the two sides saw the duties skyrocket to 145% duties for Chinese imports to the U.S. For countries without a deal, it appears that a higher global baseline tariff of about 15%-20% will be slapped on them, according to Trump, higher than the 10% baseline announced on "Liberation Day." Countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. India: tariffs and a penalty On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on India, with an additional unspecified "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. "While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what Trump imposed on India on "Liberation Day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner, but at the high end of the 20%-25% range that the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that the partners were in an "intense phase" of talks, noting that it would be unlikely for an agreement not to include any tariffs, Reuters reported.

Article: First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re Andy Palmer The emergence of CAT bonds as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In just the last few weeks, Greece has been battling major wildfires across the country, temperatures notched a national record of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in neighboring Turkey, destructive and deadly flooding took place in Texas and climate change triggered record-breaking heat in Iceland and Greenland. 'Astronomical growth' Alongside increasing usage of the CAT bond market by insurers and reinsurers, it is thought that the portfolio diversification benefits of these bonds has helped to drive a surge in investor interest. Reinsurance company Swiss Re said in a report published Wednesday that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down. Andy Palmer, head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, said "astronomical growth" had helped to push the size of the CAT bond market to nearly $56 billion in the first half of the year. "One of the statements that historically was made to me in the past when I talked about CAT bond market growth was 'oh yeah, but it's the same guys just doing bigger deals. In terms of the investors buying CAT bonds, Swiss Re's Palmer said dedicated ILS fund managers account for approximately 75% of the market, with he majority of that money stemming from pension funds. Insured losses German reinsurance giant Munich Re said in a report published Tuesday that insured losses from natural catastrophe events amounted to $80 billion in the first six months of 2025, marking the second-highest first-half figure since records began in 1980.

Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/heatwaves-drive-spikes-in-demand-for-air-conditioning-across-europe.html
Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

Article: LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Thursday said that Microsoft and Amazon are hurting competition in the cloud computing industry and called for a probe into their market dominance under the country's strict new tech rules. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power" and reap financial gain exceeding the cost of capital expenditure over a sustained period. Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have built huge businesses by offering access to computing resources — such as data storage and processing — via the internet using data centers, large facilities that contain dedicated hardware. The CMA is concerned that certain practices within the space, such as egress fees and unfavorable licensing terms, are creating a "lock-in" effect where businesses are getting trapped into contractual agreements that are difficult to get out of. Microsoft said the regulator's decision "misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes." "Its recommendations fail to cover Google, one of the fastest-growing cloud market participants," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. Amazon also disputed the CMA's findings and said recommendations for a fresh probe into the two tech giants' dominance of cloud were "unwarranted." "It risks making the UK a global outlier at a time when businesses need regulatory predictability for the UK to maintain international competitiveness," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. Swift action will be "essential to ensure British businesses pay a fair price and to unleash choice, innovation and economic growth in teh U.K.," Chris Lindsay, Google's vice president of customer engineering for EMEA, said in a statement.

"Revolut is already a regulated bank in over 30 countries, including some of the toughest jurisdictions in the world," he told CNBC, noting the company is worth more than some major U.K banks on a rumored $65 billion valuation . Regulators are nervous about getting it wrong due to the lingering "scar tissue" of the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fraud prevention platform Sardine AI.

However, as realization dawned that a weaker pound translates into higher earnings from overseas revenues, the index rallied and, a week later, it was some 2.6% higher than it had been before the referendum. However, the Footsie is also packed with companies that do little or no business in the U.K., such as Antofagasta , a Chilean copper miner; Fresnillo , a Mexican silver miner; Mondi , a global leader in paper and packaging with 100 production sites around the world but none in Britain; and Ashtead Group , a plant and tool hire company that derives more than 90% of its earnings from the U.S., where it trades under the name Sunbelt Rentals — the name it will take when it moves its primary stock listing early in 2026. Even a number of businesses traditionally seen as quintessentially British to the extent that they have (or have had) the word in their company moniker, such as BP , BAE Systems and British American Tobacco , derive the majority of their earnings outside the U.K. At its launch, 41 years ago, the Footsie was full of companies that made the majority, if not all, of their sales and profits in the U.K., including a clutch of domestically oriented brewing, pub and hotel operators in Scottish & Newcastle, Bass, Whitbread, Grand Metropolitan and Allied Lyons; two flat pack furniture and joinery companies in Magnet & Southerns and MFI; and a whole host of then U.K.-focused retailers, including Burton Group, House of Fraser, Sears (no relation to the U.S. Carlos Jasso | Afp | Getty Images With globalization yet to take off — this was, of course, before the fall of the Berlin Wall — even those financial services companies in the Footsie were largely domestically focused, including the insurers Commercial Union and General Accident (now both part of Aviva Group), Prudential and Sun Life and lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Midland Bank (now part of HSBC) and Barclays, which was yet to embark on its push into the wholesale and investment banking activities with which it is most closely associated these days.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men. Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as "very manual" and "not efficient." It is "something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were," he said.

Article: Brazil's Supreme Court put former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday ahead of his trial for an alleged coup plot, underscoring the court's resolve despite escalating tariffs and sanctions from U.S. In an interview with Reuters last month, Bolsonaro called Moraes a "dictator" and said the restraining orders against him were acts of "cowardice." Some Bolsonaro allies have worried that Trump's tactics may be backfiring in Brazil, compounding trouble for Bolsonaro and rallying public support behind Lula's leftist government. However, Sunday demonstrations by Bolsonaro supporters — the largest in months — show that Trump's tirades and sanctions against Moraes have also fired up the far-right former army captain's political base. Bolsonaro appeared virtually at a protest in Rio de Janeiro via phone call to his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, in what some saw as the latest test of his restraining orders. sanctions against the judge, adding: "I hope the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this person (Moraes) causing so much upheaval." The judge's orders, including the restraining orders under penalty of arrest, have been upheld by the wider court. Those orders and the larger case before the Supreme Court came after two years of investigations into Bolsonaro's role in an election-denying movement that culminated in riots by his supporters that rocked Brasilia in January 2023. In contrast with the tangle of criminal cases which mostly stalled against Trump, Brazilian courts moved swiftly against Bolsonaro, threatening to end his political career and fracture his right-wing movement. In a statement after the arrest on Monday, Congressman Bolsonaro called Moraes "an out-of-control psychopath who never hesitates to double down." Trump last month shared a letter he had sent to Bolsonaro. The arrest could give Trump a pretext to pile on additional measures against Brazil, said Graziella Testa, a political science professor at the Federal University of Parana, adding that Bolsonaro seemed to be consciously provoking escalation. "I think things could escalate because this will be seen as a reaction to the Magnitsky sanction" against Moraes, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner at the Think Policy political risk consultancy in Brasilia, referring to the asset freeze imposed on Moraes last week.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S.

Trump, meanwhile, claimed on social media that the report, which painted a dour picture of the economy, was "RIGGED" and the previous months' revisions had been "CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!" The only way to protect the integrity of economic data, said Hassett, is to replace the economists and statisticians who lead the agencies that collect data.

Asked to provide evidence for Trump's claims of impropriety, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that revisions made to prior months were "the evidence." Trump also said the revisions were evidence of someone manipulating the data, "I assume in the hopes of getting 'Kamala' elected." "What you saw on Friday was the effect of trying to do a better job, getting more information," Beach said, referring to the revisions. Despite the old-fashioned style of surveying households through the mail and in-person interviews, the first-release estimates of jobs added or lost each month has been getting more and more accurate over time, according to Yale Budget Lab director Ernie Tedeschi.

Revisions are common in jobs report data, as the initial estimate often becomes more precise as additional payroll data becomes available in subsequent months.

Pirro, a 1975 graduate of Albany Law School, has significantly more courtroom experience than Martin, who had never served as a prosecutor or tried a case before taking office in January. In the final minutes of his first term as president, Trump issued a pardon to Pirro's ex-husband, Albert Pirro, who was convicted in 2000 on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.

In response, Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since 2007 but has been militarily battered by Israel in the war, said it would not relinquish "armed resistance" unless an "independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital" was established. Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza war and deal for the release of half the hostages ended last week in deadlock.

Article: A federal agent with US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) exits his vehicle near MacArthur Park, as a large group of federal law enforcement agents gather in the area, in Los Angeles, California, on July 7, 2025. Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing Monday afternoon at which the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12 by Judge Maame E. She wrote the government cannot use factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion to detain someone. "If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion," the judges wrote. The Los Angeles region has been a battleground with the Trump administration over its aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and Marines for several weeks. Among the plaintiffs is Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a video taken by a friend on June 13 being seized by federal agents as he yells, "I was born here in the states, East LA bro!" They want to "send us back to a world where a U.S. can be grabbed, slammed against a fence and have his phone and ID taken from him just because he was working at a tow yard in a Latino neighborhood," American Civil Liberties Union attorney Mohammad Tajsar told the court Monday. The federal government argued that it hadn't been given enough time to collect and present evidence in the lawsuit, given that it was filed shortly before the July 4 holiday and a hearing was held the following week. Sung, a Biden appointee, said that in an area like Los Angeles, where Latinos make up as much as half the population, those factors "cannot possibly weed out those who have undocumented status and those who have documented legal status." She also asked: "What is the harm to being told not to do something that you claim you're already not doing?" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the Friday night decision a "victory for the rule of law" and said the city will protect residents from the "racial profiling and other illegal tactics" used by federal agents.

It was unclear why Tae Heung "Will" Kim, who is a legal permanent resident with a green card, was detained July 21, his attorney Karl Krooth said at a news conference. Kim, who went to South Korea to attend his brother's wedding, is now in removal proceedings to be deported and is being held at an immigration detention facility in Arizona, Krooth said, adding that he has yet to talk to his client. But one attorney told the Washington Post, which first reported on Kim's detention, that he fulfilled a community service requirement and successfully petitioned for nondisclosure to seal the offense from the public record. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.

Medvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X that day. Trump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. On Friday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, "Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that."

Article: It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em Sydney!" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social not long after markets opened. Monday's gains come a little over a week after American Eagle first announced that the "Euphoria" star would headline its fall marketing campaign with the slogan: "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans." Initially, the stock rose in an apparent bout of meme stock mania, but over the past week, shares of the company have been down as American Eagle has faced criticism about the campaign. American Eagle has stayed largely quiet on the matter — releasing a brief statement on its Instagram account on Friday that said the slogan "is and always was about the jeans." "We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way," the company said. "Great jeans look good on everyone." The saga highlights the tightrope that marketers are walking when deciding what types of ads to run and the audiences they should be targeting when consumer attention is harder than ever to win and maintain. Bud Lite's ill-fated Dylan Mulvaney collaboration and the subsequent impact on its sales and its parent company's stock price, highlighted how things can go wrong when companies release marketing that some may consider "woke." On the other hand, American Eagle's campaign is now showing the other side of that coin – what can happen when a company releases marketing that isn't "woke" and perhaps more accepted on the cultural right. In the lead-up to American Eagle's campaign with Sweeney, the company has been struggling to grow sales, and the marketing blitz is one of the many things it's doing to reverse that negative slump. Whether or not that search interest translates to more shoppers buying jeans from American Eagle will be more clear when the retailer reports earnings, which is expected in the next few weeks. As of Friday's close, shares of American Eagle were down more than 27% so far this year as the company grapples with larger macroeconomic concerns related to tariffs, consumer spending and its own merchandising missteps. Earlier this year, the company said it would take a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise after it pulled its full-year guidance due to slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment. For its current quarter, American Eagle said in May that it expects revenue to fall 5%, comparable sales to be down 3% and gross margin to be lower compared with the prior year.

Leslie Josephs/CNBC The terminal — set to be roughly the size of the two new LaGuardia Airport terminals that opened in the past decade combined — will be dedicated solely to international travelers, which the developers said is key to the design. "From the very first pen to paper … we had the international customer in mind," Jennifer Aument, CEO of the New Terminal One, the company developing the project, said at a press conference at the airport last month. Leslie Josephs/CNBC CNBC and other media got a look at the construction progress, led by Aument, in early July as part of what the company said will likely be among the last hardhat tours of the facility before opening day. In addition to Terminal 1, the current Terminal 7, currently home to Alaska Airlines and Ireland's Aer Lingus, will be knocked down for a new Terminal 6, whose first gates are set to open next year.

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: JB Straubel, who helped launch Tesla and served as its tech chief until 2019, founded Redwood Materials in 2017 to recycle batteries and build a closed-loop supply chain for EVs. For its first microgrid, Redwood partnered with Crusoe, best known for the massive AI data center it is building in Abilene, Texas, as part of Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project backed by OpenAI, Oracle , SoftBank and others. "In the energy industry, the holy grail has been 24/7 renewable power, but forever the cost of batteries was too high, until today," says Cully Cavness, Crusoe co-founder, COO and president. Redwood says it has over a gigawatt-hour of reusable batteries in its inventory, the equivalent of 12,500 EVs, and it's designing 100 plus megawatt projects, up to 10 times the size of the pilot microgrid with Crusoe. We're already working on engineering projects that are in that type of magnitude." In addition to its recycling business, Redwood will now be competing in a growing energy storage market with established players like Tesla , which has built a successful energy business with its Megapack grid-scale storage. "The future demand for energy storage specifically is massive, so it's not surprising that players who traditionally haven't been in this space are looking to enter," said Pete Tillotson, senior research analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Potentially with clients where cost is a little bit more of a limiter."

David Cannon | David Cannon Collection | Getty Images When Nikesh Arora was named CEO of Palo Alto Networks in June 2018, the cybersecurity company was valued at about $19 billion and was taking on large networking vendors like Cisco and Juniper, which were building security into their products. Seven years later, Palo Alto's market cap has expanded by sixfold, driven in part by an acquisition spree that's seen Arora spearhead more than 20 deals in an effort to create a one-stop shop for all things cybersecurity. Arora's ambitions took a dramatic turn last week, when Palo Alto announced by far its biggest bet to date: the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security platform CyberArk . In the company's 2024 annual report published in October, Palo Alto named Alphabet as a competitor for the first time, listing it alongside Cisco and Microsof t as companies "that have acquired, or may acquire, security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market." In 2023, Cisco paid $28 billion for Splunk, which focuses on data protection. watch now In an interview with CNBC soon after last week's announcement, Arora said CyberArk fits squarely into his company's focus on AI and, in this case, the complexities that come with granting permissions and access. "Our entire acquisition strategy, our organic product growth strategy, our selling strategy, has always been based on that approach," said Arora, 57, who's seen his personal wealth top $1 billion with the big run-up in the stock. In CyberArk's earnings report last week, the company said revenue jumped 46% in the latest quarter to $328 million, equal to about 14% of Palo Alto revenue, based on the most recent report. Arora said in the conference call announcing the deal that he intends to work with CyberArk CEO Matt Cohen and Chairman Udi Mokady to "accelerate the pace of innovation." "We look for great products, a team that can execute in the product, and we let them run it," Arora told CNBC. "This is going to be a different challenge, but we've done well 24 times, so I'm pretty confident that our team can handle this." Most of Arora's acquisitions over the years have been of smaller startups. Roughly 10 months before leaving SoftBank, Arora said he was buying more than $480 million worth of stock in the Japanese conglomerate, which he said involved taking an "enormous risk" reflecting his confidence "about the future" of the company. While that's all firmly in the past, Arora said that over the years, he's "scavenged" different leadership qualities from each of his mentors, including an appetite for risk from Son. He was a skilled and experienced businessman but some worried that he hadn't created a notable product or founded a company like many of his industry peers, said Gallo, who recommends buying Palo Alto shares. In his first few years at the company, Arora made numerous acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion, helping Palo Alto penetrate the cloud security space as more businesses were moving their workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google's cloud. "Every company wishes they were in Palo Alto shoes, where they could actually offer all these different products," said Andrew Nowinski, an analyst at Wells Fargo who has a buy recommendation on the stock. You're not going to see many vendors like Palo Alto." With its expansion into identity management, Palo Alto is going big in a space that's viewed by experts as a key spending area for IT in the coming years. "That's your growth driver." Ofer Schreiber, senior partner and head of YL Ventures' Israel office, said Palo Alto has helped take an extremely fragmented market, consisting of lots of point solutions, and created a centralized vendor for clients. Analysts at KeyBanc lowered their rating to the equivalent of hold from buy, due partly to concerns about a lack of "meaningful synergies" in the product offerings and a view that customers would prefer an "independent vendor solely focused on identity." But TD Cowen's Shaul Eyal still recommends buying the shares. He said that what's made Arora successful is his "relentless focus on execution" and his strategy of betting on sizeable markets where Palo Alto can quickly scale and become the leader or runner-up.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of."

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In response at the time, the company said it stands "by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program." In July, the Journal also reported that the DOJ interviewed several doctors about UnitedHealth's practices and whether they felt pressured to submit claims for certain conditions that bolstered payments from the Medicare Advantage program to the company.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

Article: That topped the Dow Jones estimate for 2.3% and helped reverse a decline of 0.5% for the first quarter that came largely due to a huge drop in imports, which subtract from the total, as well as weak consumer spending amid tariff concerns. "The consumer is hanging in there, but still on edge until the trade deals are done." The period reported Wednesday includes President Donald Trump's April 2 "liberation day" tariff announcement. "The anti Trump story has been that we're going to have a recession or a depression because of the tariffs, which are going to jack up prices and cause consumers to run for the exits" Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, said on CNBC. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a metric that Fed watches closely as a demand indicator, rose just 1.2%, down from the 1.9% increase in Q1 and the slowest gain since the fourth quarter of 2022.

Article: Payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 104,000 for the month, reversing a loss of 23,000 in June and topping the Dow Jones forecast from economists for an increase of 64,000. Though the pace of hiring is well off where it stood last year, the June total was the best since March and consistent with a slowing but still fairly vibrant jobs picture. "Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient." The report follows months of concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would hold back economic growth and stymie consumer spending.

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Article: "The new EU tariff of 15% means that UK exports to the US have become relatively cheaper, which could boost British trade with the US as American firms buy goods from Britain rather than the EU," he explained. consumers due to the lower tariff rate, meaning they may favor British products over those manufactured in the EU, Alex Altmann, partner and head of Lubbock Fine LLP's German desk, suggested in a note published shortly after the EU-U.S. "The UK's lower US tariffs do offer a major incentive for EU companies to shift some of their manufacturing bases to the UK or to expand their existing UK facilities," he added. Here the UK benefits from its major trading partner averting a recession which could have resulted in a decline in UK exports to the EU," he said in written comments. "If the US had proceeded with 30% tariffs against most EU goods, UK goods with a 10% tariff, which is paid by the US importer in most circumstances, could have appeared significantly more attractive," she said.

Article: UN official says Israel expanding Gaza operations would risk 'catastrophic consequences' Just now Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Yang Tian BBC News Share Save Watch: UN official says Netanyahu's reported Gaza expansion plans risk "catastrophic consequences" A top UN official has warned there would be "catastrophic consequences" if Israel expands its military operations in Gaza, after reports Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is pushing for a total reoccupation of the strip. Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenča told a meeting of the UN Security Council such a move would be "deeply alarming" if true, and could endanger the lives of more Palestinians, as well as Israeli hostages held by Hamas. It has been suggested that the plan could be a negotiating tactic to pressure Hamas after a recent breakdown of ceasefire talks or an attempt to shore up support from Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. Israel's military said it already had operational control of 75% of Gaza, but the new plan would propose occupying the entire region - including areas where more than two million Palestinians now live.

Article: Court documents seen by the BBC allege the shipments included Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become a key focus of US export controls aimed at stopping China purchasing the cutting-edge technology. The DOJ alleged that over the last three years ALX Solutions, a company it said was run by Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, exported the chips from the US to China without the required licences. Two Chinese nationals have been arrested and charged with illegally shipping millions of dollars' worth of powerful AI chips to China, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Tuesday. "Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support or updates." According to court documents, California-based ALX Solutions had three known employees: Mr Geng handled the firm's finances, Ms Yang was its secretary, while its chief executive was not named in the documents. Business records showed the company sent goods several times from the US to shipping firms in Singapore and Malaysia between October 2022 and July 2025, the DOJ said, noting that both countries are used as transit hubs to "conceal illegal shipments" to China. Last December, ALX sent a shipment with export-restricted computing chips - including Nvidia's H100 and GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs - which was checked by US customs, according to court documents. In one 2023 invoice valued at more than $28.4m, ALX allegedly declared to Super Micro Computer, a supplier of Nvidia chips, that the devices were ordered for a Singapore-based customer. But a US export control officer in Singapore could not verify that the chips arrived in the country and the company named did not exist at the listed location, the court document said. "It appears that ALX Solutions shipped the Nvidia products to different end users." Super Micro did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC but said in a statement to the Reuters news agency that it was "firmly committed to compliance with all US export control regulations." It added that it would not comment on an ongoing legal case but would cooperate with authorities in any such proceedings.

Meta made the announcement as WhatsApp rolled out new anti-scam measures to alert users to potential fraudulent activity, such as a user being added to a group chat by someone not in their contacts list. Meta said WhatsApp "proactively detected and took down accounts before scam centres were able to operationalise them." In one case, WhatsApp worked with Meta and ChatGPT-developer OpenAI to disrupt scams linked to a Cambodian criminal group that offered cash for likes on social media posts to promote a fake rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme. "There is always a catch and it should be a red flag for everyone: you have to pay upfront to get promised returns or earnings." Scam centres that cheat people out of billions of dollars are known to operate from South East Asian countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand.

Article: NFL and ESPN reach nonbinding agreement for sale of NFL Network and other media assets toggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AP Ever since the NFL announced it was looking to sell NFL Network and other media assets, ESPN had been seen as one of the favorites to make a deal. Under the terms, ESPN will acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the rights to distribute the RedZone channel to cable and satellite operators and the league will get a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Along with the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN will have a second nonbinding agreement where the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property that can be used by NFL Network and other assets that have been purchased. "When I came back to Disney and assessed essentially the future of ESPN, it became clear that ESPN had to launch a bigger and more robust and digital or direct-to-consumer product, not only for the sake of ESPN's business, but for the sports fan," Iger said. "And obviously, when you start thinking about high-quality sports content, your eyes immediately head in the direction of the NFL because there's really nothing more valuable and more popular than that." NFL Network — which has nearly 50 million subscribers — would be owned and operated by ESPN and would be included in ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. "It'll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we'll continue to balance that in a really arm's length way where we'll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners." Sponsor Message The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel). "The moves align with the NFL's longstanding ambition to reach $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027 — a target first set in 2010, when league revenue stood at approximately $8.5 billion," O'Connor said. Intentionally ceding equity to the NFL transforms ESPN from a media licensee into a true platform partner — with few properties rivaling the league in terms of cultural significance, appointment viewing, audience reach, and monetization efficiency." No major changes yet Viewers will likely not see any immediate impacts until next year once everything is approved.

Article: pulls $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine contracts toggle caption Mark Schiefelbein/AP WASHINGTON — The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. Sponsor Message The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. "To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. "I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business," said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said "other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a "shift in vaccine development priorities," the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start "investing in better solutions." "Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

"After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC. "While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States."

On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." During its last meeting, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that given the 50-basis-point cut, there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth, and as such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."

Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to "our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain." It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as "meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. An uncertain future With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn't figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, "but the damage is already done."

The committee bestowed the prize on us in recognition of the work we have done over the past 70 years to build and strengthen the global taboo against the use of nuclear weapons. We’ve done this by using the testimonies of hibakusha, as atomic bomb survivors like me and my fellow members of Nihon Hidankyo are known, to spread the knowledge around the world of what nuclear weapons actually do to human beings.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Article: and others planned marches in the 1960s calling for Black voting rights has been reconstructed in its entirety at a museum near Detroit The Jackson Home, where Martin Luther King Jr. and others planned marches to call for Black voting rights in the early 60s in Selma, Ala., is shown being reconstructed at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Mich., Monday, July 14, 2025. The intricate operation to move and preserve the Jackson Home and other artifacts from the Civil Rights era preceded President Donald Trump's efforts to eradicate what he calls “divisive” and “race-centered ideologies,” and minimize the cultural and historical impact of race, racism and Black Americans. It was within the walls of the 3,000-square-foot (280-square-meter) bungalow that King and others strategized a series of peaceful marches from Selma to the state capital, Montgomery, that helped usher in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Jawana Jackson told AP in 2023 that she decided to ask the Henry Ford — a history museum complex in Dearborn, Michigan — to relocate and preserve her parents' house and its contents because she believes “ the house belonged to the world.” The building was taken apart and carried the more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to be reconstructed in Greenfield Village at the Henry Ford, and archivists are digitizing and cataloguing some 6,000 items contained within. “The fact that the Jackson family saved things for this long, even though they may have been out of date or old, they knew the significance of all the things that were in that home, and they saved them and preserved them,” Mooradian said. has withdrawn from the United Nation’s cultural agency because, according to the White House, UNESCO “supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November.” Trump also fired the Kennedy Center board and slashed funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. And the president issued an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," that condemns the Smithsonian Institution — a vast complex of museums, galleries and a zoo — for what he calls its “widespread effort to rewrite history.” The Smithsonian includes the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” Trump wrote. "And it’s important that we tell the truth, that people look to us for the truth, not for opinion, not for judgements but for the truth.” Just weeks after Trump's March executive order, the Rev. Amos Brown, paster emeritus of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church who was an activist in the Civil Rights Movement, said he was notified that two family bibles and a book on Black history that he loaned to the African American history museum in 2016 would be removed from the collection. The Smithsonian said in a June statement that it “routinely returns artifacts per applicable loan agreements and rotates objects on display in accordance with the Smithsonian’s high standards of care and preservation and as part of our regular museum turnover.” The Smithsonian and the African American museum have not responded to AP interview requests. The National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Museum of American History are holders of some of the most iconic artifacts from the Civil Rights era, including the lunch counter and stool from a Greensboro, North Carolina, diner where a group of Black college students conducted a sit-in to protest segregation. The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson has on loan a door from a grocery store where witnesses said 14-year-old Emmett Till of Chicago whistled at a white woman in 1955.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) Tudor Lakatos, who goes by the stage name Elvis Rromano, strikes a pose while getting ready for his performance with the Taraful Frunzelor band at the Terasa Florilor restaurant, in Bucharest, Romania, Friday, June 20, 2025. Decked out in a rhinestone shirt and oversized sunglasses, with his black hair slicked back into a 1950s-style quiff, Lakatos swivels his hips and belts out his own idiosyncratic versions of hits like “Blue Suede Shoes” at venues throughout Romania. Lakatos prefers to say that he “channels” the King of rock ‘n’ roll’s global appeal to break down stereotypes about the Roma and provide a positive role model for Roma children. “I only wanted one thing — to make friends with Romanians, to stop being called a Gypsy,″ he added, using an often derided term for people belonging to the Roma ethnic group. The Roma, an ethnic group that traces its roots to South Asia, have been persecuted across eastern Europe for centuries and are still associated with high rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. They account for about 7% of the population of Romania, where a fifth say they have faced discrimination in the past year, according to a recent survey by the European Union. At a time when anti-Roma discrimination was mainstream, Lakatos found that singing Elvis songs was a way to connect with ethnic Romanian students while rock music was a symbol of rebellion against the oppressive government. A school teacher for the past 25 years, Lakatos uses his music to show his students that they can aspire to something more than the dirt roads and horse driven carts of their village in northwestern Romania. I have said many times, ‘Call us what you want, dinosaur and brontosaurus, but at least join hands with us to educate the next generation.'” But Lakatos still crisscrosses the country to perform at venues large and small. On a hot summer evening, that journey took Lakatos to Terasa Florilor in Bucharest, a neighborhood joint whose owner takes pride in offering live music by local artists who perform on a stage made of wooden beams painted in vivid colors. In his version, the lyric Elvis made famous becomes simply “don’t step on my bare feet.” It’s a message that Elvis — born in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, during the Great Depression — probably would have understood.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power." — Holly Ellyatt In the markets U.K.

Article: 'Facial recognition tech mistook me for wanted man' 2 hours ago Share Save Sonja Jessup BBC London Home Affairs Correspondent Share Save BBC Shaun Thompson is challenging the Met Police's use of live facial recognition technology after he was wrongly identified as a suspect A man who is bringing a High Court challenge against the Metropolitan Police after live facial recognition technology wrongly identified him as a suspect has described it as "stop and search on steroids". Last month, the Met said it had made more than 1,000 arrests since January 2024 using the technology, including alleged paedophiles, rapists and violent robbers, of which 773 had led to a charge or a caution. The Met plans to double its use of LFR across London because it says it is helping catch dangerous criminals But Mr Thompson said his experience of being stopped had been "intimidating" and "aggressive". Every single time." He described how he had been returning home from a shift in Croydon, south London, with the community group Street Fathers, which aims to protect young people from knife crime. "When I asked what I was wanted for, they said, 'that's what we're here to find out'." He said officers asked him for his fingerprints, but he refused, and he was let go only after about 30 minutes, after showing them a photo of his passport. "I can only imagine the kind of damage it could do to other people if it's making mistakes with me, someone who's doing work with the community." 'Intrusive' or 'making London safer'? Big Brother Watch, whose director Silkie Carlo is bringing the legal challenge alongside Mr Thompson, said it was the first time that a misidentification case had come before the High Court. "Shaun's legal challenge is such an important opportunity for the government and the police to take stock of how this technology is spreading across London in a really unaccountable fashion." Big Brother Watch's Madeleine Stone says the legal challenge is a chance to "take stock" of how the "intrusive technology" is being used A Met Police spokesperson said that the force was unable to provide a full comment on Mr Thompson's case due to ongoing proceedings, but that it was confident its use of LFR was lawful. "We continue to engage with our communities to build understanding about how this technology works, providing reassurances that there are rigorous checks and balances in place to protect people's rights and privacy." In July, the Home Office said it would be setting out its plans for the future use of LFR in the coming months, including a legal framework and safeguards. The Met is planning to double its use of LFR to up to 10 times a week across five days, up from the current four times a week across two days. This helps us round them up." He pointed to a case where a registered sex offender, who'd been banned from being alone with young children, was picked up on LFR cameras in Denmark Hill, south-east London, in January with a six-year-old girl. We've worked really hard on this." The Met has said it works within existing human rights and data protection laws and its approach has been tested by the National Physical Laboratory, to check there is no gender or racial bias. Unless you're wanted, in which case, we arrest you." Registered sex offender David Cheneler was jailed for two years after LFR cameras spotted him with a six-year-old girl The Met has also announced plans to use LFR on the approach to and from this year's Notting Hill Carnival over the August Bank Holiday, although not within the boundaries of the event. It says the move will protect Carnival against a "tiny minority of individuals intent on causing serious harm to others" and the watchlist will include wanted suspects, as well as missing people "who may be at risk of criminal or sexual exploitation". 'An algorithm and a camera' "The Met Police has ramped up LFR in an extraordinary fashion over the last couple of years, in a way that raises questions around racial discrimination and the communities they're targeting", said Madeline Stone. However, it says it having to make savings due to "real term funding cuts" and expecting to lose around 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff by the end of the year. Mr Thompson told me he was concerned about the deployment of LFR in communities where there were already low levels of trust in policing and contrasted this approach with the work being done by Street Fathers. "We speak to the kids, we make time for the children, we put ourselves in hotspots." He said parents regularly called the group asking them to remove weapons they had discovered in their children's bedrooms.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns year as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

On Wednesday, Trump vowed to "substantially" raise tariffs on Indian exports, following a 25% hike and threats of penalties over Russian oil and arms purchases. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating."

Article: It's 2025, the year we decided we need a widespread slur for robots toggle caption Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe Debate over the song of the summer rages on, but if there were a contest for a word of the summer, one front runner would surely be the onomatopoeiac, clanker. One popular video from July shows a delivery robot on wheels – the kind that looks like a mobile cooler with flashing lights that look like eyes – stopped on a patch of grass on the side of a road. Clanker!" Sponsor Message Even with little background, it's clear from context clues that clanker is not a good thing, but in this installment of Word of the Week we will answer – what exactly does it mean? Adam Aleksic, a linguist, author and content creator best known across social media as the @etomologynerd , told NPR it's a derogatory term for robots that stems from the Star Wars universe dating back to 2005. … And then we adopted it because it sounds useful." While other sci-fi franchises and fandoms have created their own lexicon that included robot slurs — Battlestar Galactica and Blade Runner both used skin-job as a pejorative for human-appearing robots — Aleksic said, those terms didn't really catch on because they didn't make as much sense. He noted that clanker has already had a long life on Star Wars' subreddits, specifically subreddits about the Battlefront video game, and as a meme, where people use it to belittle robots. toggle caption Patrick Kovarik/AFP via Getty Images "I remember tweets from January of this year where people were saying, 'Oh, we need a slur for AI' And finally, it seems like that cultural need is being met," he said. So ironically, the people saying clanker, are assigning more of a personality to these robots than actually exists." Many of the memes circulating now zero in on the xenophobia of it all, and what social media users are calling, robot racism or robophobia. Using existing stereotypes and tropes, they joke about a not too distant future where robots are ubiquitous as second-class citizens, facing discrimination in the same ways that Black people and other racial or ethnic groups in America have historically faced. In one video with over 7.7 million views , TikTok user @vibestealer, who is a young Black man, pretends it's 2044 and his daughter has brought home a robot boyfriend. Another popular iteration of the meme features people pretending to apologize to their future robot overlords for past anti-robot transgressions, including use of the "c-word." The robots are coming for us all toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images North America The spread of clankers comes as AI is fundamentally transforming work and the workplace as we know them. Sponsor Message "We have a social need right now to respond to the proliferation of AI, especially when AI is taking human jobs, especially when they're replacing online creators," Aleksic said. "To be clear on a longer time horizon, and by longer we're talking about 15 to 20 years, not 50 or a hundred years, there will be virtually nothing that a human being can do that a machine can't do as well or better for a tiny fraction of the cost," Adam Dorr, the director of Research for Rethinx, a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank that focuses on understanding disruptive technology, told NPR. "That's simply where the technology of artificial intelligence and robotics and automation is headed." For now, he said, we are living in a grace period, where AI will enhance the work that we do.

Article: "And he also started to talk about very violent, gory things." It wasn't until Elliott was hospitalized, in early 2024, that Dana formed a more complete picture of how strangers online had brought him to the point of extensive self-harm and repetitive thoughts of suicide. And it was finally then that Dana learned about some of these networks, such as 764 and CVLT (pronounced "cult"), which have been linked to random violent attacks, arson, child sexual abuse material, child sexploitation, bomb threats, plots to murder and at least two deaths in the U.S. Now, more than a year after Elliott was hospitalized, Dana finally feels ready to share the story of what her family went through, in the hope that it may help other parents understand some of the dangers that children may encounter online. "But it seemed like somehow he kept finding other items to harm himself." Sometimes, Dana said, he would come to her for help after cutting himself, saying he felt like he was out of control. He parroted the ideology of accelerationist extremists, who frame Western civilization as decadent and corrupt and who promote the idea that total societal collapse is necessary to establish a new fascist order. He's always been very clear about having meaning and purpose." Sponsor Message Nihilistic violent extremism In March, the FBI issued a public service announcement warning of "violent online networks," such as 764 and CVLT, that target minors and other vulnerable individuals. The FBI has recently focused on a relatively new motive within this area, for which it has coined the term "nihilistic violent extremism." "The term Nihilistic Violent Extremism (NVE) refers to what is motivating some of these subjects to commit criminal acts," the FBI wrote in a statement to NPR. Reporting from The Washington Post has found instances where predators within these networks sought to boost their influence by encouraging victims to livestream their suicides, and by then sharing those videos. Sponsor Message "There is a massive mixture of harms that are occurring in this ecosystem," said Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism and the Accelerationism Research Consortium. "There are individuals who are collaborating with one another across transnational lines, using any and every ideological framework they can to push people into harming others [and] harming themselves." Kriner has testified as an expert witness in federal cases against people accused of involvement with these networks. And then they use those videos to further exploit them." Perhaps most concerning, say researchers of online extremism, is that minors targeted in these spaces are often encouraged to victimize other children. "He was very angry that he had been called out, [saying] that we were all being ridiculous and making too big of a deal of nothing." But at the hospital, it quickly became apparent that Elliott's condition had gotten very serious. They encourage their victims to carve certain symbols to call out certain members." Dana said medical staff assessed that Elliott was at moderate/high risk of suicide, but because he didn't intimate a plan for suicide, the staff wanted to send him home after treating his wounds. And she said right away, I suspect that your son is being extorted or has been contacted by a group called 764." Sponsor Message The officer told Dana that the FBI would be getting involved to determine whether Elliott had been contacted directly by anyone in the network. And he was fully naked." Sponsor Message Dana said she and law enforcement representatives found evidence that there had very recently been some direct messaging with someone whom they could not identify. The FBI told Dana that Elliott needed inpatient care for 30 to 60 days, primarily to "detox" from the harmful networks in which he had immersed himself for many months. toggle caption Joanna Kulesza for NPR "This is hard to say about your own kid, but he was the target of a good bit of bullying at school, oftentimes with a social media component," she said.

Article: And I tried to talk to the council and the mayor to work something out, and it didn't," says Wilson, a now-retired school bus driver, who led a group of other Black voters to sue St. Sponsor Message Their lawsuit was among the hundreds of cases that private individuals and groups have brought to enforce protections against racial discrimination under the federal Voting Rights Act, which then-President Lyndon B. "It wouldn't have happened" without the pressure of his lawsuit, says Wilson, a onetime candidate for alderperson who was later elected as a Democratic member of his Louisiana parish's police jury, a local governing board. "If you didn't go further, it just wouldn't happen." The legal path that allowed Wilson to fight against the dilution of his and other Black voters' collective power at the ballot box, however, may be ending soon, as a novel legal argument makes its way to the U.S. Contrary to decades of precedent, Republican state officials in at least 15 states contend that private individuals and groups do not have the right to sue to enforce Section 2 because they are not explicitly named in the landmark law's text. The justices may also be preparing to take up a broader question about the constitutionality of Section 2 protections, based on an order last week for legal briefs in a Louisiana congressional redistricting case originally filed by Black voters. At a time when the Justice Department under the Trump administration has backed off from voting rights lawsuits the department had brought when former President Joe Biden was in office, the prospect of voters of color no longer being allowed to bring their own cases has supporters of the Voting Rights Act concerned about the law's survival. "It's just going to be disastrous because if we can't do that, well, we just have no chance of fairness." An estimated 92% of Section 2 lawsuits have been brought by private individuals and groups since 1965 While the Voting Rights Act is widely considered one of the most effective civil rights laws in U.S. Still, estimates back up what has long been known in the legal world: Private individuals and groups, not the Justice Department, have brought the overwhelming majority of Section 2 cases. "Private plaintiffs have been party to 96.4% of Section 2 claims that produced published opinions since 1982, and the sole litigants in 86.7% of these decisions," writes Ellen Katz in a 2024 Michigan Law Review Online article summing up estimates by the Voting Rights Initiative at the University of Michigan Law School, which focused on cases filed after Congress last amended Section 2. Separately, going back to 1965, Morgan Kousser, a professor emeritus at the California Institute of Technology and historian of the Voting Rights Act, has tallied more than 1,800 Section 2 lawsuits, including those that ended with settlements. "Certainly counting the settlements as well and looking at how many of them are the result of private lawsuits makes clearer what the stakes are in destroying the private right of action." Sponsor Message How a Supreme Court ruling against a private right of action under Section 2 can have a "domino effect" So far, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose rulings apply to seven mainly Midwestern states, is the country's only federal appeals circuit that has found no private right of action under Section 2. While the Supreme Court has, for now, paused an 8th Circuit panel's ruling in the North Dakota redistricting case, some conservative justices have expressed openness to ending a private right of action for Section 2. Franita Tolson, an election law expert and dean of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, sees that as "basically subjecting the protections of the act to political whim." "This case is a cloud over this anniversary because essentially what it means is that it depends on who wins the election in order to make sure voters are protected," Tolson says. "And that is certainly not what Congress intended in passing the Voting Rights Act in 1965 or subsequently amending it so many times." In a report released before the law was amended with bipartisan support in 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee echoed a similar House committee report by underscoring "the existence of the private right of action under Section 2, as has been clearly intended by Congress since 1965." The 8th Circuit panel for the North Dakota case maintained, however, that because this kind of explicit language did not end up in the text of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2 "does not unambiguously confer an individual right" that private individuals and groups can enforce by suing. It all may be setting up what Tolson fears will be a "domino effect" on the sections of the law that survived the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Given Shelby County and what this decision could potentially do, there won't be much left for the Voting Rights Act — words on a page." Last week, a separate 8th Circuit panel ruled that private individuals and groups in its circuit's seven states also have no right to sue to enforce the law's Section 208 protections for voters with a disability or limited language proficiency. This year, Democrats in both the House and Senate have reintroduced the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in part to ensure that an "aggrieved person" has the right to bring a lawsuit under the law. Native American voters in North Dakota and Black voters in Alabama are waiting for clarity from the courts toggle caption Jack Dura/AP Amid the court rulings and legal discussions, Jamie Azure, chair of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, is trying to stay focused on what drove his tribal nation to partner with the Spirit Lake Tribe to sue North Dakota's secretary of state. Now having to appeal to the Supreme Court to ensure their right to bring this lawsuit in the first place, Azure says he remains undeterred and mindful of how the Civil Rights Movement helped pave this legal path for tribal nations today to fight for their voting rights. As the lead plaintiff in a Section 2 congressional redistricting lawsuit that Black voters brought against Alabama, Milligan's name has become shorthand for the 2023 Supreme Court decision in which a majority of justices, in an unexpected move, upheld the court's past rulings on Section 2 and sided against the southern state. "We look at the numbers of Section 2 voting rights lawsuits, and if I'm on the football team that's opposing that and I say, 'Wow, this play here is killing us,' well, then, of course, I would attack the play," explains Milligan, now a senior fellow with the Western States Center, a civil rights organization that advocates for inclusive democracy. But the problem facing Republican state officials arguing against a private right of action under Section 2, Milligan notes, is that they're "asking federal judges to discount and ignore congressional legislation and years of legal decisions that these same courts have made." Spokespeople for the offices of the Alabama and North Dakota state attorneys general did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. With so many fronts in the battle over the Voting Rights Act, Azure of the Turtle Mountain tribe says he hopes that their lawsuit at least sends a message to his nation — that their vote matters. Sponsor Message "Sometimes that's hard to tell people because we've had so many generations of distrust with the federal government, with the state government, now even with the tribal governments. "And I really hope that at the end of the day, that message also gets put out to everybody — the people elected into power should not be able to rig the systems to exclude certain types of voters from having an impact."

Article: Voice of America director says Trump officials are illegally ousting him toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images The conflict over Voice of America's future is coming to a head as a federal judge demands answers from Kari Lake, who is overseeing its federal parent for the Trump White House. The judge overseeing the Abramowitz suit and related cases has written that he is worried that Lake and the agency are failing to comply with his earlier order to ensure the Voice of America is fulfilling its congressionally mandated role to provide reliable news to all corners of the world. Lamberth wrote in an order on July 30 that Lake and the government had failed to tell him of planned mass reductions in force or the "monumental personnel decision" of removing Abramowitz as director and reassigning him to North Carolina from its Washington, D.C. Lamberth noted Lake's statement on the right-wing investigative site called "Just the News": "I'm working to eliminate the agency, and it's been a big job, but we're working hard at it." Lake told NPR later that day that the judge was "another example of a federal judiciary that is activist and out of control." Sponsor Message On Aug. Agency for Global Media, informed Abramowitz that he would be dismissed for refusing to accept the proposed reassignment, which was to become the chief administrative officer at a shortwave radio facility in Greenville, N.C. This idea that he should be sent to an engineering facility for helping shortwave radio around the world doesn't make any sense at all." "What it's really about — obviously everybody understands this — is trying to get rid of Mike Abramowitz as part of the process of trying to get rid of Voice of America." The North Carolina facility has just three full-time employees, according to Kate Neeper, Voice of America's chief strategy officer. A federal judge found illegal and unconstitutional acts; an inspector general found "waste or gross waste" by Trump-appointed CEO Michael Pack; and investigators for the Office of Special Counsel found abuses of power and violations of legal protections of the editorial independence of the Voice of America's newsroom. Sponsor Message Congress passed a law in early January 2021 requiring that a majority of a bipartisan advisory board vote for the removal of the head of Voice of America or its sister networks. Given the 2021 law, it is not clear whether Lake has the statutory power to dismiss Abramowitz without the explicit backing of that panel, which does not currently have any members. international broadcasting's importance to our national security," a joint statement sent to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in late June by all but one of the panel's dismissed members stated. "We urge Congress to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and prevent the wanton destruction of these important institutions that have advanced American interests for so long." The Justice Department legal team, led by Assistant Attorney General Brett A. A two-time unsuccessful MAGA candidate for statewide office in Arizona, Lake has emerged as one of Trump's most outspoken advocates, assailing Voice of America and other federally funded international broadcasters on Fox News, Newsmax and other right-wing sites. Lake described herself in a note sent in early March to staff as "the senior advisor for the administration." In May, as she announced that she had struck a deal with the far-right network OAN to get rights to use its content and coverage on Voice of America without cost, Lake called herself the senior advisor to the agency's chief operating officer. Later that month, Lake filed a declaration with the court listing her title as "senior advisor to the acting CEO." The acting CEO, a veteran Voice of America and agency staffer named Victor Morales, had been ousted by late July. 1 memo to Abramowitz spelling out that the agency is moving to fire him refers to Lake as "Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM." It is not clear by what process she was appointed to that role. In his July 30 order, Lamberth gave Lake and the government until next Wednesday evening to file a full explanation of what she's doing at the agency — and what's in store for the Voice of America.

Article: A federal judge on Wednesday is set to hold an evidentiary hearing over whether to block operations at the controversial facility because construction of the site allegedly bypassed federally required environmental impact studies. The hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are expected to testify -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a "one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda." Immigrant advocates have alleged that detainees have endured inhumane conditions, including flooded facilities, spoiled food, and sweltering heat -- and that they have limited access to their attorneys and are effectively housed in a jurisdictional "black hole." In a separate case challenging the legality of the facility, a federal judge ordered federal and state officials by Thursday to provide documentation showing which government or contractor is authorized to detain people at the sprawling complex. While Wednesday's hearing is limited to environmental issues -- including impacts on the nearby Big Cypress National Preserve -- the testimony is expected to shine a light on the operations of the facility and could result in a federal judge ordering the facility to be shut down until the required environmental impact studies are conducted. Rebecca Blackwell/AP On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced a similar partnership -- this time between the federal government and the state of Indiana -- to construct a migrant detention facility dubbed the "Speedway Slammer." Located 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, "Alligator Alcatraz" was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees. The site was initially conceived in the late 1960s as part of an ill-fated plan to build the "Everglades Jetport." As President Richard Nixon ushered in an era of new environmental protections -- including the law now being used to challenge Alligator Alcatraz -- the plan to build the site was scuttled, and the remaining tarmac was later used as an aviation training site. "Now, history is repeating itself as [plaintiffs] once again must act to prevent destructive development in the heart of the Everglades ecosystem in the same location," the current lawsuit says. The facility sits next to the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Big Cypress Area, ecologically sensitive and protected areas that house threatened species including the Everglade snail kite, Florida panther, wood stork, and Florida bonneted bat. "The hasty transformation of the Site into a mass detention facility, which includes the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts," the lawsuit said. The environmental groups and the tribe that brought the case allege that the sprawling facility was built without the federal or state government conducting an environmental impact statement, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) so the public and lawmakers can understand the impact of a project.

JPMorgan: Overweight, $138 JPMorgan recently increased its price forecast to $138 per share from $130.

Article: The wife of South Korea’s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol has appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol, arrives at the special prosecutor's office in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- The wife of South Korea’s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor Wednesday, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations. The investigation into Kim Keon Hee is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The team of investigators led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said Kim was questioned for about seven hours until Wednesday afternoon, but they didn’t specify whether she will be summoned again. Yoon and Kim have faced suspicions of exerting undue influence over the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate for a 2022 parliamentary by-election, allegedly at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee’s Democratic Party claims Yoon’s government tried to cover up. Yoon had been released from prison in March after the Seoul Central District Court overturned his January arrest, but the same court approved his new arrest in July, accepting a special prosecutor’s claim that he poses a risk of destroying evidence.

Article: Since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, they have imposed severe restrictions on women and banned education beyond primary school Murtaza Jafari, 25, an Afghan migrant, types code while teaching coding remotely to women currently living in Afghanistan, in Athens, Greece, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, and quickly set about implementing a dizzying array of restrictions for women: No visiting parks or gyms, no eating in restaurants, no working, except in very few professions. The new skills “helped me regain my confidence and clarity in my direction,” said the 24-year-old, who asked to be identified by her first name only for safety reasons due to the education ban. “I am so happy to be part of this journey.” The courses are part of Afghan Geeks, a company created by Murtaza Jafari, now 25, who arrived in Greece on a boat from Turkey years ago as a teenage refugee. Jafari said he started providing online courses last December to help women in his homeland, and as an expression of gratitude for the help he received as a youngster alone in a foreign country. “The main goal was to give back to the community, especially to the Afghan women, what I had received from the other people for free,” he said, sitting in his sparse one-room flat in downtown Athens. “And if I share it, it just goes and expands, and then there’s more people to learn things.” Jafari now has 28 female students in Afghanistan in three classes: beginner, intermediate and advanced. I don’t want to do it, because I respect their culture, their choice.” With the Taliban government’s restrictions increasingly confining women to their homes, and going as far as officially banning women’s voices and bare faces in public, the web has opened a new world of possibilities for women in Afghanistan. A year and a half ago, Zuhal, a young Afghan woman whose dream of going to university was shattered, partnered with a university professor to launch an online academy for women. “Our only aim or goal is to provide free education for girls and to enhance research in Afghanistan.” The academy, Vision Online University, now runs courses in a range of subjects, from psychology and foreign languages to Quranic studies, nursing and public speaking, among others.

Article: Guests rejected by Airbnb host because they're from Wales 36 minutes ago Share Save Danielle Herbert BBC News Share Save Jemma Louise Gough Jemma Louise Gough had requested to stay at the Airbnb in Manchester ahead of her visit for a gig Two women were left "gobsmacked" after an Airbnb host rejected a request from them because they are from Wales. Jemma Louise Gough, 38, and Jamie Lee Watkins, 37, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, booked a stay in Manchester ahead of watching Australian DJ Sonny Fodera at the Co-op Live Arena in November. In their booking the friends told the Airbnb host they were coming from Wales for the gig, before seeing their payment had been refunded and their booking request had been declined. When they asked the host why, she replied: "Because you're from Wales." Airbnb said the host, who did not respond further to the pair, had been suspended while it investigated, adding discrimination "has no place on Airbnb". The pair said they were even more baffled as the message was from a verified Airbnb "superhost", which requires maintaining a 4.8 or higher overall rating and a 90% or higher response rate. "I don't know what the entire country has done to her but we're so confused, we've had no answers."

Article: More controversially, in New York City and Rhode Island, nonprofits have run government-sanctioned “overdose prevention” centers, where people can use illicit drugs under the supervision of staffers trained to revive them if they collapse. But elements of the strategy known as harm reduction are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who in July barred certain federal grants from funding programs he said enable illegal drug use. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration — while blessing the use of federal funds for distribution of naloxone and fentanyl test strips — in a letter published July 29 said the “ideological concept of harm reduction” had been used to advocate for policies that are “incompatible” with the administration’s priorities. In Kentucky, a red state that has been among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis, staff members at Kentucky Harm Reduction Coalition fear the Trump administration’s rhetoric may lead local leaders to strip funding in the coming year. Advertisement Officials at SAHMSA were asked to review online documents and webpages that mention harm reduction for removal or editing, according to an email reviewed by The Washington Post and an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal Health and Human Services matters. Asked about the webpage removals, an HHS spokesperson said the administration believes “federal funding provided by the American taxpayer goes to effective, common-sense solutions that keep people out of cyclical crisis and move them into a life of recovery.” The executive order was aimed primarily at ending “endemic vagrancy” and disorderly drug-fueled crime that the administration asserts has made U.S. Advertisement To do so, the order pushes HHS to prohibit “discretionary” grants for harm reduction efforts “that only facilitate illegal drug use.” The order also vowed to end federal funding for programs that “fail to achieve adequate outcomes,” but does not define the standard. “If our leaders are serious about reducing overdoses and building safer communities, they must invest in what works: stable housing, overdose prevention centers, syringe service programs, and accessible treatment,” said Maritza Perez Medina, director of federal affairs at Drug Policy Alliance, a left-leaning group that advocates for harm reduction. “It’s alarming that cities using proven, lifesaving interventions could be punished for doing exactly what public health demands.” A long history Harm reduction programs grew as hundreds of thousands in the United States died of overdoses, peaking in 2022 at about 110,000 dead. Research funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in March concluded that between 2013 and 2020, states with more robust harm reduction policies, as scored by experts, were associated with reduced overdose risk. In a May budget document, the Trump administration said SAMHSA grants under Biden had been used to fund “dangerous” harm reduction activities, including money for syringe exchanges and supplies for “safe smoking,” which some public health advocates assert may be less lethal than injecting. In last week’s letter, SAHMSA said its funds can no longer be used to “support poorly defined so-called ‘harm reduction,’” activities, including for purchase of drug paraphernalia or “any other supplies to promote or facilitate drug use.” It stressed the administration’s “common-sense” approach focusing on prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. Advertisement Some government leaders and policy experts push back on the influence of progressive harm reduction organizations for messaging that destigmatizes illicit substance use, and has included controversial pushes for decriminalization of certain drug crimes. Those groups have twisted the public’s conception of harm reduction, giving the Trump administration ammo to bash the strategy even while publicly supporting naloxone and fentanyl test strip distribution, said Keith Humphreys, a former White House drug policy adviser during the Obama administration. But by law, federal dollars cannot be used to buy syringes, smoking supplies or directly fund overdose prevention centers anyway, said Rahul Gupta, former director of Biden’s White House Office of National Drug Control and Policy. The Justice Department argued it violated a decades-old law banning venues that operate “for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.” The legal fight continues; in July, an appeals court ruled the nonprofit can sue the government on allegations of violating religious freedom. Philadelphia Councilmember Quetcy Lozada (D), whose district includes the drug-ravaged Kensington neighborhood, slams mobile harm reduction groups for drawing crowds of users who shoot up outside residents’ homes and trash streets. Researchers in 2023 found that neighborhoods around the New York overdose preventions centers did not experience a significant increase in calls for police or emergency services, despite concerns from community members about crime spurred by the facilities.

Nearly a year into the run, hoping to edge scalpers out and keep more of the profits, “Hamilton” jacked its top ticket price way up, from $475 to a record-setting $849, which seemed to be the sweet spot for scalpers.

Article: speaks during a press conference held by Texas Democratic lawmakers after leaving the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw Texas' 38 congressional districts, in Aurora, Ill., Aug. But this is not the first time lawmakers have fled the Texas State Capitol avoid voting on a measure they disagreed with, “breaking quorum” by depriving the statehouse of enough legislators to conduct business. Greg Abbott speaks during a roundtable discussion with President Donald Trump, first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. After Abbot called a special session, 57 Democrats fled to Washington, D.C., prompting Republicans to enact a “call of the House," a procedure which mandates legislators’ attendance at the statehouse and allows the sergeant-at-arms to arrest members within Texas and bring them there. When one state representative, Philip Cortez, briefly returned to Austin in late July before rejoining the other quorum-breakers out of state, then-House Speaker Dade Phelan signed a civil warrant for his arrest. While a state district judge issued a temporary restraining order to prevent Abbott and Phelan from arresting the Democrats, the Texas Supreme Court quickly temporarily blocked that order, allowing Phelan to sign warrants for the 52 remaining absent Democrats. Lawmakers began to trickle back to the state capital, citing various personal and legislative concerns, such as the looming redistricting process that required maps to be approved before November that year. James Talarico posted on X at the time that he had come back to "clean up Greg Abbott’s latest messes from COVID to ERCOT [the Electric Reliability Council of Texas].” Some Democrats who remained in Washington were displeased. Jasmine Crockett, then a state representative, accused the legislators who returned of “trying to please the Governor and His OPPRESSIVE Agenda.” Beyond the financial cost, lawmakers faced few consequences once they returned to the state, besides then-speaker Phelan stripping state Rep. The Texas Tribune reported that Democrats spent around $10,000 a day on lodging and food during the walkout, paid by the House Democratic Caucus, additional fundraising around the quorum break, and out of lawmakers’ pockets. University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus told ABC News the FAA tracked planes that were suspected of taking Democrats out of the state, and no formal punishments were levied once they returned. Eric Gay/AP The New York Times reported at the time that then-Republican House Speaker Tom Craddick asked Texas Rangers to find and bring back the missing Democrats, but they did not have the authority to do so since the legislators were in Oklahoma. The first instance of quorum-breaking in Texas took place in 1870, when 13 legislators withdrew from the Senate but remained in the state, according to the Texas State Historical Association.

Read more CNBC Transcript: President of the United States Donald Trump Speaks with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Trump’s tariff playbook comes with a baseball twist Trump strikes EU trade deal with 15% tariffs Emre Peker, director for Europe at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said neither the EU's $600 billion investment pledge nor the $750 billion energy promise were realistic targets, "especially not in the way Trump characterized them on Squawk Box — that is, as a gift that he will use to invest in whatever he wants." "The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff. This tactic worked during Trump's first term, with the EU demonstrating soaring LNG and soybean imports from the US." Underlining problems with the feasibility of the EU's energy pledge, Peker said even if the bloc bought all U.S. 'A negotiating tactic' "I think it is a negotiating tactic, but I would have expected the EU to come up with the first round to be more realistic and more favorable to the EU," Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, lead energy analyst for the Europe team at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told CNBC by video call.

Article: As of the 2024-25 academic year, the amount families actually spent on education costs was closer to $31,000, on average, according to Sallie Mae's annual How America Pays for College report — but that figure is still up nearly 10% from a year earlier. "The last thing you want to do is leave free money on the table." There are other "stubborn statistics," too, Castellano said, which are at odds with the growing cost-consciousness among families. For example, only 71% of families submitted the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which serves as the gateway to all federal aid money, including loans, work study and grants. watch now And although most advisors say 529 college savings plans are a "no-brainer" when it comes to financial planning for college — largely because of the tax advantages — fewer than one-third of families utilize them, according to Sallie Mae. Recent data from Credit Karma paints an even starker picture: Fewer than one-quarter of the parents polled said they had a 529 account for their children and 43% said they've never heard of a 529 at all. Roughly 18% said they aren't contributing because they didn't realize the funds could be used for education expenses beyond college, such as K-12 private school tuition or trade and vocational programs — not to mention that Donald Trump's massive tax and spending package expanded 529 qualified education expenses even further to include educational therapies and tutoring, among other costs, for students starting in kindergarten.

Article: They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: Shares of AMD shed 6% in Wednesday's premarket trading hours after the chipmaker reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, missing the 49 cents per share analysts polled by LSEG had forecast. "AMD's Q2 results were decent at first glance ($7,685M/$0.48 vs Street $7,428M/$0.49), though the beat was entirely driven by Gaming, with a slight miss in Client and roughly in-line results for Data Center and Embedded. Gross margins as-reported came in slightly stronger than expectations, and roughly inline ex-charges, however overall profitability was impacted by higher than expected opex … Overall AMD's print wasn't awful; however it also didn't show any upside in anything that investors really care about (a problem for any stock that is up almost 80% since their last earnings report)." Goldman Sachs stands by neutral rating, raises price target to $150 from $140 Goldman's new forecast is 14% below AMD's current valuation. "We remain constructive on the company's ability to drive significant market share gains in the PC and enterprise server markets in the near term; however, we are more guarded on the company's ability to drive significant scale in Datacenter GPUs over time, and think operating leverage is likely to be hampered by the significant OpEx we believe is needed for the company to support its software and systems efforts tied to datacenters." Deutsche Bank maintains hold rating and lifts price target to $150 per share from $130 "Overall, we remain impressed with AMD's execution across its array of product lines, expecting solid growth to continue in CPUs and likely accelerate in DC GPUs. However, even with these growth drivers reflected in our model (CY25E EPS ~unchanged, CY26E ~ +10%), we see EPS power in the ~$6-7 range as largely being reflected in a current valuation (~25-30x P/E)." Morgan Stanley keeps equal-weight rating, lowers price objective to $168 from $185 Morgan Stanley's revised forecast calls for 4% downside. Lack of strong near term upside in GPU likely needed for stock to continue to maintain its premium, but MI400 is unchanged as a source of 2025 optimism — and key driver of value for the stock." JPMorgan reiterates neutral rating and hikes price target to $180 from $120 The bank's new price objective is approximately 3% higher than where shares of AMD closed on Tuesday. "AMD is improving its competitiveness across CPU and GPU products with Ryzen, EPYC, and Radeon Vega platforms and is on track to improve its market share and drive meaningful revenue growth in the near term. AMD is executing well toward its target financial model, but we remain Neutral as shares appear to be nearly fully valued." Wells Fargo stands by overweight rating and reiterates $185 price target Analyst Aaron Rakers' forecast is 6% above AMD's Tuesday closing price. "View 2Q25 results + 3Q25 as positive; see increasing confidence in materializing 2H25 MI355X ramp and note that 3Q25 guide does not include any MI308X contributions." Barclays maintains overweight rating, raises price target to $200 from $130 The bank's revised forecast implies 15% upside ahead. There are multiple ways to win with this name into '26 as Client and DC both hit their stride." Bank of America keeps buy rating, $200 price target "AMD continues to execute on its AI GPU pipeline, with the MI355X (Blackwell-compete) on track to volume ramp in 2H at multiple customers and the MI400 Series (Rubin-compete) and its Helios rack system also on track for 2026 launch. Overall, we expect AMD to be a consistent ~20%+ FCF generator over time." UBS reiterates buy rating and $210 per share price target The bank's forecast corresponds to a 20% upside. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases.

Article: That may not sound like much in the U.S., but it's nearly double the estimated living wage of about $6 a day for rural Mozambique , where Luís lives — and way more than he was earning just a year ago. Luís says he "didn't want to receive the money and just see it disappear from his hands," speaking in Emakhuwa, the local language in his village of Muvuruta in northeastern Mozambique. Sponsor Message "All of our pure cash USAID programs were ended," says Yolande Wright , vice president of partnerships at GiveDirectly, including $20 million that was to be delivered to the nonprofit from USAID this year. GiveDirectly gets funds from a variety of sources for its programs that give cash to people living in poverty like Luís and also to people at risk of joining violent extremist groups and to victims of natural disasters like earthquakes. After years of skepticism toward cash, last fall USAID full-throatedly embraced the model , stating it should become "a core element of its development toolkit." Now, the Trump administration has cast a pall of uncertainty around cash's future. In addition to withdrawing from foreign aid generally, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce signaled a shift away from cash in an April press conference, citing deep-rooted worries on the right about misuse and fraud. Some are trying to make the case to lawmakers as they hash out next year's budget that cash is a more effective, efficient and transparent way to deliver aid — one that doesn't require the bloated bureaucracy decried by the Trump administration. "And there's evidence to show it, like hundreds of studies." From underdog to darling A little over a decade ago, the idea of USAID, or any aid agency, simply giving someone like Luís $1,000 was largely unheard of, says Daniel Handel, policy director at Unlock Aid, a foreign aid think tank. I got forcibly reassigned because of it." But by fall 2024, USAID was embracing the model, putting out strategy documents arguing cash should be a core element of its developmental toolkit. "There's now a substantial evidence base supporting the fact that unconditional cash transfer programs improve the well-being of the transfer recipients and their family," says Alison Fahey , director of partnerships and strategic initiatives at The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT. "Across an accumulation of studies, we see people increasing their spending , improved food security , higher income , higher savings , better mental wellbeing , their kids are more likely to be in school ." Those benefits, Fahey says, come because cash gives people power — they can buy the things they know they need or invest in things they'd previously only dreamed of. From 2017 to 2022, cash aid's slice of total humanitarian assistance went from about 15% to about 24% — more than $10 billion — according to an analysis by the CALP Network, a group of over 90 organizations involved in cash assistance. In the April press briefing , State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that some cash aid programs were cancelled "because they provided cash-based assistance, which the administration is moving away from," citing concerns about misuse and fraud. In 2023, some GiveDirectly staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo stole over $1 million intended for families in extreme poverty, roughly 1% of the total cash dispensed by GiveDirectly that year. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio seemed to express some support for cash transfers over traditional USAID programs in a congressional hearing when discussing why some programs got cancelled. … In some cases, [aid should go] directly to the person, the group on the ground." Advocates see the cash transfer model, which doesn't require that money move through layers of bureaucracy, as one that could resonate with the administration.

Article: PLAINS, Georgia — Protestant churches often have two flags at the front of their sanctuaries, the American flag on the left and the white banner, blue rectangle and red cross of the Christian flag on the right. Advertisement The drama at Maranatha, where the 39th president taught Sunday school for years, is emblematic of how Plains is trying to move forward now that the town — for the first time in at least a half-century — is not completely defined by Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. One key draw is the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, and many are anxious over how the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts for the National Park Service could affect it. Jan Williams, a longtime friend of the Carters and, along with husband George, part of a once-competing peanut business, fears Maranatha will become nothing but a monument to the former president.

Advertisement As with the church flag kerfuffle, the yard signs were illustrative of people feeling more comfortable expressing their political views now that Jimmy and Rosalynn weren’t riding their bikes around town. “Plains has never been all Democratic or all Republican, but for the most part it’s always been very conservative,” said Phil Wise, a Plains native, architect of Carter’s 1976 Florida win and later White House aide.

(Formula TV via AP, File) A prominent Georgian journalist was convicted Wednesday of slapping a senior police officer during an anti-government protest and sentenced to two years in prison in a case that was condemned by rights groups as curbing press freedom. The case is just one of many to draw protests and international criticism in recent months as the ruling Georgian Dream party has been accused of eroding civil society and democratic rights in the South Caucasus nation. In a joint statement in January, 14 embassies, including those of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K., said Amaghlobeli’s case represented “another worrying example of the intimidation of journalists in Georgia, restricting media freedom and freedom of expression.” Gypsy Guillén Kaiser, advocacy and communications director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned that Amaghlobeli’s case was “a sign of the declining environment for press freedom in Georgia and a symbol for the fight between truth and control.” “You have to decide whether you’re going to vilify journalists, criminalize them, and present them as nefarious characters with malicious intent in order to control information, or whether you’re going to have a public that is truly free, freely informed and empowered,” Guillén Kaiser said. But this will not succeed — we will defend the interests of our state to the end.” Georgia has seen widespread political unrest and protests since its parliamentary election on Oct. Nearly all the leaders of Georgia’s pro-Western opposition parties have been jailed for refusing to testify at a parliamentary inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili, a probe that critics of Georgian Dream say is an act of political revenge. The critics accuse Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the party has denied. Among controversial legislation passed by Georgian Dream is the so-called “ foreign influence law," which requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “pursuing the interest of a foreign power.” That law later was replaced with one called the Foreign Agent’s Registration Act, under which individuals or organizations considered as “agents of a foreign principal” must register with the government or face penalties, including criminal prosecution and imprisonment. “I think that the main goal of the government was to scare us, for us to leave the country or shut down or change profession,” says Mariam Nikuradze, founder of the OC Media outlet.

Article: Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, has been a key funder of Texas Democrats in their mission to leave their home state in hopes of preventing Republicans from implementing a new Congressional map that they view as rigged. Powered by People, a voter registration and mobilization group, has been donating to the Texas House Democratic Caucus -- not members directly, or for any line-item expense -- to help cover upfront costs for the group, such as lodging and transportation, an O'Rourke spokesperson told ABC News. Powered by People has been putting funds aside since Trump's directive, and O'Rourke assured the caucus in the weeks leading up to the potential vote, if they wished to leave the state, they would have his support, both in rhetoric and cash. The O'Rourke spokesperson, who noted that O'Rourke's donor pool reaches all the way back to his 2018 Senate bid, said the group plans to release details on how much they've been able to fundraise to help support the quorum break efforts at some point. A spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus told ABC News that "members are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support from citizens across Texas and the country who stand with them." And they reiterated that the effort is being expensed legally. He denied all the allegations, calling them at the time a partisan "sham." He called the ensuing impeachment proceedings an "ugly spectacle," adding that they were "never meant to be fair or just." The Texas Senate acquitted Paxton in September 2023.

Article: prosecutors won’t seek the death penalty in their cases against Mexican drug lords Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero FILE - This image released by the FBI shows the wanted posted for Rafael Caro Quintero. prosecutors said Tuesday they won't seek the death penalty in their cases against Mexican cartel kingpin Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero, the drug lord charged with orchestrating the 1985 killing of a U.S. Caro Quintero’s attorney, Elizabeth Macedonio, said she and her client “look forward to resolving this matter quickly to bring closure to all parties.” Zambada's lawyer, Frank Perez, said the government's decision “marks an important step toward achieving a fair and just resolution.” Prosecutors said last winter that they were having plea discussions with Perez. Prosecutors wouldn't comment further Tuesday after telling judges in brief letters that Attorney General Pam Bondi had directed them not to pursue capital punishment for Caro Quintero, Zambada, or a third defendant, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, known as “The Viceroy." Sent from Mexico to the U.S. Carrillo Fuentes' lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, said he and his client “are very thankful and think it was the right decision.” The cases are unfolding in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where infamous Sinaloa cartel co-founder Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was tried and convicted. While Zambada was seen as the cartel's strategist and dealmaker, prosecutors have said he also was enmeshed in its violence, at one point ordering the murder of his own nephew. The White House has called him “one of the most evil cartel bosses in the world." Prosecutors say he is responsible for sending tons of heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine into the U.S.

Article: Florida Gov_ Ron DeSantis’ administration is apparently preparing to build a second immigration detention center, awarding at least one contract for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.” FILE - A sign marks the entrance to Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, a site used by the Florida National Guard, near Starke, Fla., July 15, 2025. (AP Photo/David Fischer, File) FILE - A sign marks the entrance to Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, a site used by the Florida National Guard, near Starke, Fla., July 15, 2025. Ron DeSantis ' administration is apparently preparing to build a second immigration detention center, awarding at least one contract for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.” The site would add to the capacity at the state's first detention facility, built at an isolated airfield in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz." Already, state officials have inked more than $245 million in contracts for that facility, which officially opened July 1. Florida plans to build a second detention center at a Florida National Guard training center called Camp Blanding, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) southwest of downtown Jacksonville, though DeSantis has said the state is waiting for federal officials to ramp up deportations from the South Florida facility before building out the Camp Blanding site. Civil rights advocates and environmental groups have filed lawsuits against the Everglades facility, where detainees allege they've been forced to go without adequate food and medical care, and been barred from meeting with their attorneys, held without any charges and unable to get a federal immigration court to hear their cases. President Donald Trump has touted the facility’s harshness and remoteness as fit for the “worst of the worst," while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the South Florida detention center can serve as a model for other state-run holding facilities for immigrants. The Florida Division of Emergency Management, the state agency that built the Everglades facility, has awarded a $39,000 contract for a portable emergency response weather station and two lightning sirens for what's been dubbed the “North Detention Facility," according to records in the state’s public contract database. The equipment will help enable “real-time weather monitoring and safety alerting for staff." The contract comes as the state approaches the peak of hurricane season, and as heavy rains and extreme heat have pounded parts of Florida. Immigrant advocates and environmentalists have raised a host of concerns about the Everglades facility, a remote compound of heavy-duty tents and trailers that state workers and contractors assembled in a matter of days. Last week, FDEM released a heavily redacted draft emergency evacuation plan for what the document called the “South Florida Detention Facility.” Entire sections related to detainee transportation, evacuation and relocation procedures were blacked out, under a Florida law that allows state agencies to make their emergency plans confidential. Questioned by reporters on July 25, FDEM executive director Kevin Guthrie defended the emergency response agency's plans for the makeshift facility, which he says is built to withstand a Category 2 hurricane, which packs winds of up to 110 mph.

Article: Attorneys for over 200 women are calling for a federal investigation of alleged sexual abuse they say was rampant for decades at juvenile bootcamps run by the Los Angeles County probation department LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys representing over 200 women said Tuesday they want the federal government to investigate allegations of rampant sexual abuse that occurred over decades at juvenile bootcamps run by the Los Angeles County probation department. The request comes months after Los Angeles County officials agreed to a $4 billion payout to settle 7,000 claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, the largest sex abuse settlement in U.S. The attorneys' clients were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they were sent to camps designated for “at-risk youth” who had committed minor offenses, separate from the juvenile halls. John Manly, one of the attorneys, said during a news conference Tuesday that the camps were akin to the island owned by Jeffrey Epstein where he allegedly brought underage girls to be exploited. “The sad and unbelievable truth is these camps were dens of sexual predation where LA County probation officers in charge of helping these children get on track turned them into human sex toys,” the attorneys said. His colleague, Courtney Thom, said one former deputy probation officer, Thomas Jackson, had been accused by at least 30 women of sexual assault during their time in the custody of the probation department. "When our client was released back to her grandmother, this deputy probation officer went out to her home and would take her from her home to areas within the community to continue sexually abusing her and continued to contact her and torment her throughout her adult life as well,” Thom said. As usual, the county abandoned their defense and blamed the employees.” Jackson’s case was referred by the county to prosecutors for investigation in December 2023 but they declined to prosecute because the alleged incidents happened too long ago, according to an April 7 memo, the Los Angeles Times reported. how can anyone assure this won’t happen again?” The county’s Office of County Counsel said in a statement that it is working with authorities to hold those who committed abuse accountable, but records are no longer available in many of the cases. “In addition, plaintiffs’ attorneys have not produced evidence enabling the County to identify perpetrators in the vast majority of claims." Nonetheless, the statement said, the county "wholeheartedly supports efforts to ensure that those who have committed crimes against minors are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” The plaintiffs in the $4 billion settlement were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years. Manly and Thom have represented plaintiffs in several high-profile sexual abuse cases, including gymnasts in their lawsuit against USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports doctor Larry Nassar, who was accused by more than 300 women and girls of sexual assault and is serving three prison sentences that will likely keep him locked up for life. The letter also called for an investigation of whether the county concealed allegations of ongoing abuse at the juvenile facilities when the Justice Department investigated the facilities in 2006 and established a federal monitor in 2008.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) A plinth that once held a statue of Confederate general Albert Pike is seen in a park near the headquarters of the Department of Labor on Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- Two Washington, D.C.-area statues commemorating the Confederacy will be restored and replaced, in line with President Donald Trump's pushback on recent efforts to reframe America's historical narrative. The National Park Service announced Monday that the statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate brigadier general and a revered figure among Freemasons, would resume its previous position in Washington's Judiciary Square, a few blocks from the U.S. The statue was pulled down with ropes and chains on Juneteenth in 2020 as part of mass protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. The Pike statue restoration, which is targeted for October, “aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and reinstate pre-existing statues,” the park service said in a statement. Unlike the Left, we don’t believe in erasing American history — we honor it.” In 2022, an independent commission recommended that the memorial be taken down, as part of its final report to Congress on renaming of military bases and assets that commemorate the Confederacy. Some of the figures also on the statue include a Black woman depicted as “Mammy” holding what is said to be the child of a white officer, and an enslaved man following his owner to war. In March, Trump issued an executive order entitled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” It decried post-Floyd efforts to reinterpret American history, stating, “rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame." The order targeted the Smithsonian network of museums as having “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” It also instructed the Interior Department to restore any statue or display that was “removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.” Pike, who died in 1891, is more known for his decades-long stint as a senior leader of the Freemasons than for his Confederate military career. When protesters toppled the statue in 2020 while police officers looked on, Trump — then in his first term — called it “a disgrace to our Country” on social media and called for their immediate arrests.

Republican leaders have frequently seized on episodes of violence to portray the city as a case study of violence in cities run by Democratic mayors, even as city officials note that violent crime overall is down more than 25% from the same period last year.

When the other officer arrived, Mills told him Johnson did not have a gun but said Johnson had tried to disarm him several times, according to police body camera footage. The lawsuit said Johnson, who was Black and a standup comedian, was having a mental health crisis when he was killed at a vast remote airport parking lot near where he lived. Employees had called 911 five times over about two hours asking for police to check on Johnson as he walked barefoot on the lot’s hot pavement, according to the lawsuit and information previously released by police. Mills responded alone after the employees reported that Johnson was “trying to fight them.” Johnson did not respond to Mills’ questions and rushed toward the officer, according to body camera footage. After Mills pushed Johnson off him and ordered him to move back, Mills pulled out his gun and said he would shoot Johnson if he didn’t get on the ground. District Attorney Brian Mason has not yet decided whether the shooting was justified or criminal charges should be filed following an investigation by other area law enforcement agencies, his spokesperson, Christopher Hopper, said. At a May 29 press conference on the shooting, Aurora police Chief Todd Chamberlain said that “the absence of a weapon does not mean there is an absence of danger.” Johnson's mother, Taushica Carter, said that as a military veteran, she has trouble understanding how someone who took an oath to uphold the law killed her only child.

Article: Brazilians are divided over a house arrest order against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office Division among Brazilians over Bolsonaro house arrest order could set the tone for next election Demonstrators rally in support of former President Jair Bolsonaro at the entrance to his residential complex, to denounce his house arrest order by the Supreme Court, in Brasília, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) Demonstrators rally in support of former President Jair Bolsonaro at the entrance to his residential complex, to denounce his house arrest order by the Supreme Court, in Brasília, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) SAO PAULO -- Brazilians were divided Tuesday over a house arrest order against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office. Supporters of the far-right leader and some moderates see the ruling as harsh, while allies of incumbent President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other moderates want to move on and leave the issue for the judiciary. “One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,” the analyst said. “The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.” Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who put Bolsonaro on trial for his alleged role in the coup plot to keep him in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election, ordered the 70-year-old former president's arrest for violating precautionary measures imposed on him by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons. The polarization between supporters and critics of the former president took Brazil's congress by storm Tuesday and was also reflected in figures from pollster Quaest, which say 53% are favorable to the order against the far-right leader and 47% against it. Since de Moraes’ order, Bolsonaro allies are pledging to stop congress unless an amnesty bill is passed in favor of the far-right leader and his supporters involved in the coup plot probe. “I've already told speaker Hugo Motta that I will do that in the first moment I am working as the speaker of the house during one of his trips abroad,” Cortes said. We need to start working with respect, civility and dialogue so congress can fulfill its mission in favor of Brazil and our population.” Members of Brazil's opposition say such a move would also allow Bolsonaro to run in next year's election, from which he was barred by the country's top electoral court for abuse of power in 2022. Meanwhile, Lula and his allies initially showed they wanted to move past the issue of Bolsonaro's house arrest and focus on trade negotiations with Trump, who imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian import goods starting Wednesday. If the next Brazilian election has the same standard of the previous face off between Lula and Bolsonaro, the winner will be decided by turnout and a very slim number of moderates. Eduardo Leite, a moderate from the Rio Grande do Sul state, embodied the split among many Brazilian voters who will likely have to chose one of the two camps in 2026. "I don't like the idea of a former president not being able to speak, and even less see him get arrested for that before he is put on trial at the Supreme Court,” Leite said. “Our country does not deserve to remain hostage to this legal-political tug of war that only hinders us all.” Gilberto Kassab, the chairman of the centrist Social Democratic Party, has both Bolsonaro and Lula supporters in his party's ranks and said “exaggeration on both sides are contaminating Brazil.” “I express my solidarity to the former president, I regret his arrest without discussing the merits of the issue.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states Things to know about the Voting Rights Act and the cases that could unravel it FILE - Luci Baines Johnson looks at the desk May 16, 2023, on display at the LBJ Presidential Library, that President Lyndon B. His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Article: The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 60 years ago but has been slowly eroding for more than a decade The Voting Rights Act marks its 60th anniversary as its core provisions are being eroded North Dakota Democratic Rep. Jayme Davis poses for a photo in her office with a 2024 campaign sign on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at Turtle Mountain Administrative Offices on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color." The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1, saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect." The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill, but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

But President Donald Trump's call for Texas to blatantly redraw the maps to better ensure that Republicans retain control of the House in the 2026 elections has blown the lid off of the practice. In response to events in Texas, Democrats in California are considering a draft proposal to reshape their own district maps and cut away five Republican seats while securing more precarious seats already held by Democrats. Kathy Hochul said if Texas proceeds, “we must do the same.” The proposal, however, would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the legislature twice and be approved by voters. The House Majority leader, David Moon, a Democrat, says he will sponsor legislation to trigger redistricting in Maryland if Texas or any other state holds redistricting ahead of the census. Ron DeSantis has said he was considering early redistricting and “working through what that would look like.” That's because a law in the Republican-led state requires it before the 2026 midterm elections. ____ Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

Article: government personnel to leave a region in the north of the country affected by a toxic spill from a Chinese-owned mine that happened six months ago 6 months after toxic mine spill in northern Zambia, US Embassy orders personnel out of the area FILE - This image taken from video Wednesday, Feb. The embassy said in an alert on social media that new information revealed that “hazardous and carcinogenic substances” including arsenic, cyanide, uranium and other heavy metals had polluted a major river system flowing through the town of Chambishi and the nearby city of Kitwe, and had possibly become airborne, following an accident at the mine in February. Environmentalists and others raised concerns over the extent of the damage months ago following the spill at the mine run by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a division of China's state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining group. The spill happened when a tailings dam that holds acidic and heavy metals waste from the mine collapsed, according to investigators from the Engineering Institution of Zambia, resulting in some 50 million liters (13.2 million gallons) of toxic materials flowing into the Kafue River system. Within days of the spill, dead fish could be seen up to 100 kilometers (60 miles) downstream, raising fears that the contamination could affect millions living along the Kafue River, which runs for 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) through the heart of the southern African country. Sino-Metals apologized and committed to help with cleanup efforts, which included the Zambian Air Force dumping hundreds of tons of lime into the river in an attempt to counteract the acidic waste.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to.

Article: The EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website . Landlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away," said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform. Cambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists. "It's a $32 million program for the government, but it provides, in terms of return on investment — it's huge," said Nicole Upano, director of public policy for the NAA. "It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program." If Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.

Lawyers from the free speech group, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, brought the lawsuit on behalf of the student newspaper at Stanford University, the Stanford Daily, arguing that several of its staff members have been forced to self-censor or quit the paper out of fear that the government could retaliate for what it publishes. The lawsuit says that the newspaper, which is open to all students and has more than 200 members, has weathered resignations and withdrawn stories by noncitizens who were concerned that publishing content about Israel or the conditions in Gaza could leave them vulnerable to deportation.

Article: watch now President Donald Trump is taking a victory lap over the foreign investment pledges he has secured as part of several recent trade deals, variously describing the multi-billion dollar commitments as a "signing bonus" and "seed money" and a "gift." "If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member bloc economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy." Last month, Trump likened the trade deal with Japan, which includes a pledge of $550 billion in investment, to "seed money." "Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the President reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Moreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview. "The European Union and her Member States have very limited capabilities to direct private actors to make these purchases and investments," David Kleimann, a trade expert and senior research associate at ODI Europe, told CNBC. Shuji Kajiyama | Via Reuters As part of the deal, the White House says that Japan "will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries." Japan, on the other hand, says the deal involves a mix of investments and loan guarantees totaling a maximum of up to $550 billion, Bloomberg reports. "But such claims are completely off the mark."

Article: Fugitive jailed for murder of mother walking dog Just now Share Save Alice Cunningham & Laura Foster BBC News, Suffolk Reporting from Ipswich Crown Court Share Save Suffolk Police A man has been jailed for the murder of Anita Rose who died after being attacked while walking her dog near her home village of Brantham, Suffolk A "dangerous" fugitive who savagely murdered a woman while she was walking her dog has been jailed for life. Anita died four days after she was found with serious injuries and Barclay, 56, of no fixed address, was sentenced to a mandatory life term of life - and will serve a minimum of 25 years after he was found guilty of murder following a trial at Ipswich Crown Court. Suffolk Police Roy Barclay was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the murder of Anita Rose On the day she was attacked Anita left her house at about 05:00 (BST). BBC Crimewatch A statement from Richard Jones, Anita Rose's partner, was read during the hearing At the time of the attack, Barclay had been wanted on recall to prison having breached the conditions of his licence. Suffolk Police Barclay had been captured on CCTV in the Brantham area on the day Anita was attacked The court first heard how Anita had enjoyed living in Brantham and had taken to help neighbours and other vulnerable residents when they were in need. Her daughter, Gemma Rose, described the "immeasurable" loss and revealed she had taken to telling her own children about "how dangerous the world is" in an effort to protect them. One of her sons, Ashley Rose, told the court he had desperately tried to help the investigation by buying a drone to find some of his mother's personal items that had been missing and were later found in Barclay's possession. Suffolk Police Barclay had been living in a camp in Brantham when he attacked Anita Judge Levett said Barclay was an "unpredictable, dangerous" man who was "prone to terrible outbursts of violence at the slightest confrontation". Barclay only served five years in prison before he was released on parole but Judge Levett told him this should have been enough time for him to work on his "temper". Watch: How a man who murdered a woman was caught Judge Levett also questioned why Barclay had chosen to remain silent by not answering police questions when he was arrested or why he did not give evidence in his trial. "It may have been her challenging you about what you were doing, she may have caught you doing things which caused offence, but I am satisfied so as to be sure that, for whatever reason, at the time of the incident your intention was to kill Anita and not simply to cause her really serious harm." Barclay had previously pleaded guilty to remaining at large after being recalled to prison. "Three days after the attack he left Anita's phone in Ipswich enabling it to fall into the hands of others while causing a distraction and diverting significant resources, this ultimately led to his downfall with further CCTV obtained capturing his actions." Nicola Pope, of the Crown Prosecution Service, similarly described the attack as "savage". "By carefully building a case with DNA recovered from Anita's belonging and sightings on CCTV – combined with previous bad character evidence against Barclay – we were able to present a clear picture to the jury."

Republican leaders have frequently seized on episodes of violence to portray the city as a case study of violence in cities run by Democratic mayors, even as city officials note that violent crime overall is down more than 25% from the same period last year.

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to convene his security cabinet on Thursday to discuss expanding Israel’s military campaign into the rest of Gaza, even amid growing domestic criticism that such a step would endanger the lives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in the enclave. Netanyahu’s high-stakes proposal comes as the last military operation, which began in mid-March, has come to a virtual standstill and as negotiations with Hamas for a cease-fire and a hostage-for-prisoner exchange have reached an impasse. A hunger crisis in Gaza, which many aid agencies and foreign governments blame on Israeli policies, has spurred an international diplomatic backlash against Israel, including from some of its closest traditional allies. In Israel, the proposal to extend the military takeover of the enclave into the heart of Gaza City and central areas of the territory, where officials believe hostages are being held, is causing growing concern, especially among the families of the hostages and their supporters.

(AP Photo, File) FILE - In this image taken from video, President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera arrives at a polling station in Bangui, Central African Republic, Sunday, July 30, 2023. (AP Photo, File) BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow's state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic's government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow's demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). "Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an x-ray, an ultrasound machine, and a bone density scanner -- all owned by the town. "This is important for our community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, "in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important." According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents. Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors -- by 2035. "This is a huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community." In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here. "It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends." Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said. "We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before," he said, "and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on." Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. He was kind of a different kind of physician." Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a 3-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June. Camron Browning, MD, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist. "My goal," he said, "was to be able to come home and serve my hometown." Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice. After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency. "This was always my dream."

Article: Kennedy Jr.'s statements before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday revealed a concerning lack of knowledge about the major health programs he'd oversee, should he be confirmed as HHS secretary. The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are narrow." In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income. Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program." He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues -- who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is "fully paid for by the federal government," when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees. Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be "rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges." "He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with," Benjamin said. Also, "he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true." Benjamin was asked -- given the number of Kennedy's misstatements -- whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles. [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does." Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite a few instances of disinformation." Multiple times, he suggested "that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll." Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, "Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID." Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations -- which he now denies -- raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.

Article: The mall-based boutique, long known for its ear piercing services and eclectic mix of jewelry and accessories, is staring down about $500 million in debt, rising competition and an evolving retail landscape that's made it harder than ever to grow a business profitably. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders," CEO Chris Cramer said in a news release. "We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives." The company said stores will continue to operate as it looks to monetize its assets and continues a review of "strategic alternatives," which could mean finding a buyer that's willing to keep the business running. Tariffs are expected to impact its supply chain, and sleeker, savvier competitors have entered the market, such as Studs and Lovisa, the upstart ear piercing chains that have promised a safer, and cooler, approach to piercings. This is more attuned to what younger consumers want and has left Claire's looking somewhat out of step with modern demand," GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note.

Article: 27 minutes ago Share Save James Gallagher • @JamesTGallagher Health and science correspondent Share Save Getty Images mRNA vaccines were heralded as a medical marvel that saved lives during the Covid pandemic, but now the US is pulling back from researching them. And another question is where should mRNA vaccines fit into the pantheon of other vaccine technologies - because there are many: Inactivated vaccines use the original virus or bacterium, kill it, and use that to train the immune system - such as the annual flu shot use the original virus or bacterium, kill it, and use that to train the immune system - such as the annual flu shot Attenuated vaccines do not kill the infectious agent, but make it weaker so it causes a mild infection - such as the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine do not kill the infectious agent, but make it weaker so it causes a mild infection - such as the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine Conjugate vaccines use bits of protein or sugar from a bug, so it triggers an immune response without causing an infection - like for whooping cough use bits of protein or sugar from a bug, so it triggers an immune response without causing an infection - like for whooping cough mRNA vaccines use a fragment of genetic code that temporarily instructs the body to make parts of a virus, and the immune system reacts to that Each has advantages and disadvantages, but Prof Finn argues we "overhyped" mRNA vaccines during the pandemic to the exclusion of other approaches, and now there is a process of adjusting. The claim that mRNA vaccines do not protect against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu "just isn't true", says Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Vaccine Group, who is soon stepping down as the head of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government. The same measles or HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case.

Earlier, Witkoff took an early morning stroll through Zaryadye Park, a stone’s throw from the Kremlin, with Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian president’s envoy for investment and economic cooperation, footage aired by TASS showed. Dmitriev said later on social platform X that “dialogue will prevail.” READ MORE: Russia will no longer aide by self-imposed moratorium on intermediate-range missiles Dmitriev played a key role in three rounds of direct talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in recent months, as well as discussions between Russian and U.S. A Russian offensive that started in the spring and is expected to continue through the fall is advancing faster than last year’s push but is making only slow and costly gains and has been unable to take any major cities. On Tuesday, Trump said “we’ll see what happens” regarding his threat to slap tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, which could increase import taxes dramatically on China and India. The Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis warned in an assessment this week that there are “clear signs that the Kremlin is preparing for a broader confrontation with NATO,” including a military build-up along Russia’s western flank with alliance countries in recent years. Russia announced Tuesday that it no longer regards itself as bound by a self-imposed moratorium on the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race.

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's .

Article: Hiroshima survivors fear rising nuclear threat on the 80th anniversary of atomic bombing toggle caption Louise Delmotte/AP HIROSHIMA, Japan — Hiroshima on Wednesday marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. "There will be nobody left to pass on this sad and painful experience in 10 years or 20 years," Minoru Suzuto, a 94-year-old survivor, said after he kneeled down to pray at the cenotaph. Mayor says world should have learned from tragedy Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui warned against a growing acceptance of military buildups and of using nuclear weapons for national security during Russia's war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Mideast, with the United States and Russia possessing most of the world's nuclear warheads. "They threaten to topple the peacebuilding frameworks so many have worked so hard to construct." He urged younger generations to recognize that such "misguided policies" could cause "utterly inhumane" consequences for their future. "We don't have much time left, while we face a greater nuclear threat than ever," said Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese grassroots organization of survivors that won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for its pursuit of nuclear abolishment. Hours before the official ceremony, as the sun rose over Hiroshima, survivors and their families started paying tribute to the victims at the Peace Memorial Park, near the hypocenter of the nuclear blast 80 years ago. Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, noting Nihon Hidankyo's Nobel Peace Prize and countries' re-commitment to a nuclear free world in "the Pact for the Future" adopted last year. Guterres stressed the importance to carry forward the survivors' testimony and message of peace and added: "Remembering the past is about protecting and building peace today and in the future." Near Hiroshima's iconic Atomic Bomb Dome under high security, more than 200 protesters gathered, holding posters and flags carrying messages such as "No Nuke, Stop War" and "Free Gaza! toggle caption Louise Delmotte/AP Survivors want nuclear abolishment, not deterrence Wednesday's anniversary comes at a time when possession of nuclear weapons for deterrence is increasingly supported by the international community, including Japan. Sponsor Message Some survivors said they were disappointed by President Donald Trump's recent remark justifying Washington's attack on Iran in June by comparing it to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the mild response from the Japanese government. "I don't think we can get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it was justified by the assailant." In the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said Wednesday that he was praying for those who suffered physical, psychological and social effects from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, adding that the event remains "a universal warning against the devastation caused by wars and, in particular, by nuclear weapons." Japan seeks US nuclear protection Japan's government has rejected the survivors' request to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or attend its meetings as observers because it is under the protection of the U.S. Matsui, the city's mayor, in his speech Wednesday, urged Japan's government to sign and ratify the nuclear weapons ban treaty, a request also made by several groups of survivors in their meeting with Ishiba after the ceremony. Past prime ministers have stressed Japan's status as the world's only country to have suffered nuclear attacks and have said Japan is determined to pursue peace, but survivors say it's a hollow promise.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) The Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.” “Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” she said. The new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York, California and Connecticut, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois. The administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a “non-sanctuary city.” The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a “Page Not Found” error message. The administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

Article: Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre” at the Santa Fe Opera House This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. (Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

Sponsor Message But in a sign that some new penalties over Russia's war were already underway, President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order saying he would slap an extra 25% tariff on India over its purchases of Russian oil. Yuri Ushakov, an adviser to Putin, was quoted by state media as calling the discussions "useful" and "constructive." Ushakov added that while the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the "Ukraine issue," they also discussed "perspectives for possible strategic cooperation" between the US and Russia. Trump is frustrated The meeting came as President Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin over his failure to suspend attacks on Ukrainian cities despite months of U.S.-led peace efforts. Trump had campaigned to return to office vowing he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin developed over his first term in office to end the war in "24 hours." But Trump says his patience has grown thin with daily reports of Ukrainian civilian casualties from Russian attacks. Europe Trump cuts deadline for Russia to reach peace deal with Ukraine Trump cuts deadline for Russia to reach peace deal with Ukraine Listen · 3:31 3:31 Soon Trump upped his ultimatum, announcing last week that Russia had just "10 or 12 days" before to make peace. When asked later if there was a way for Russia to avoid the additional economic pressure, Trump told reporters Tuesday: "Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed." Trump also questioned whether any penalties could push Russia to change course. "In order to solve the issue in a peaceful way," continued Putin, "we need deep conversations, and not in public, but in the calm quiet of the negotiating process."

Article: So I've seen my share of meltdowns," he added, referring to the combination of two rails which were ultimately acquired after their consolidation by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway , as BNSF. Ferguson cited past deals in the rail sector in voicing his concerns, such as when CSX and Norfolk Southern acquired and divided up Conrail in 1997, and a similarly timed Union Pacific takeover of Southern Pacific. They need our voice if they're going to know how to do this on day one, and without us at the table, we're very fearful that they're going to make the same mistakes and create meltdowns." SMART Transportation Division (SMART-TD) has already stated its intention to petition the government to block the deal , with Union Pacific's safety record among its primary concerns. The merger , announced last week, would be the largest buyout ever in the rail sector, and would create the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail operator, combining Union Pacific's strength in the western U.S. The Union Pacific–Norfolk Southern merger, when approved, will benefit America, supporting reindustrialization and moving products more efficiently across the U.S.," a company spokesperson said, adding, "we have a history of implementing technology changes, such as NetControl across our 32,000-mile network without issue." On an analyst call hosted by the Union Pacific last week to discuss the deal, CEO Jim Vena told analysts that the combined companies will deliver faster, more comprehensive freight service to U.S. Craig Decker, managing director and lead of the transportation & logistics infrastructure investment banking team at Brown Gibbons Lang & Company, tells CNBC there could be the potential to displace or eliminate key transload, warehousing and container/chassis management at the intermodal interchange points as a result of the merger. He said the implications of this deal extend to "the various partners in the supply chain, including the trucking companies, whose relationships and networks have been configured and are dependent on their existing rail relationships." The key determinant in whether this merger will go through is the Surface Transportation Board, which has historically frowned on mergers of Class 1 freight rails, the largest rail networks in the U.S., according to Decker. "Under normal circumstances, I would say that the STB will disapprove of the deal as it did with CP/CSX, but given President Trump's willingness to tackle incredibly tough negotiations and his success thus far, his influence becomes the wildcard which will decide whether this deal eventually gets approved," he added. SMART-TD Ferguson said the union will go before the board and lay out its case that the deal is not good to keep commerce and transportation safely moving in the U.S. Ferguson tells CNBC that the risk to jobs from creating a new transcontinental rail network will extend well beyond the two freight rail companies in the transaction, and potentially hit labor across the middle of the country.

Article: Technicians stand next to an oil rig which is manufactured by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant, during a media tour of the plant in Dhamasna village in the western state of Gujarat, India, August 26, 2021. President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

Article: How Trump's secondary tariffs on Russia could hit the global economy 16 hours ago Share Save Jonathan Josephs • jonathanjosephs Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images "I used trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars", President Trump has said Despite being the world's most sanctioned country, Russia has continued to use its vast energy wealth to bankroll its war in Ukraine. Bloomberg Russia's vast energy industry has helped bankroll its invasion of Ukraine Increased energy prices "The key channel by which secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian energy could impact the global economy would be through the level of energy prices," says Kieran Tompkins from the consultancy Capital Economics. He explains that "the current backdrop is one where OPEC+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon." Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump. "That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them." Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images "The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable," the country's foreign ministry said Pricier iPhones from India Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. India calls Trump's tariff threat over Russian oil 'unjustified' US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone production to India - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. Imports to the US from India are already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up, and he told CNBC that number could be raised "very substantially". The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from India which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that's just 10% of 2021 levels. Derailing trade talks with China China is buying the most Russian oil, and a decision by President Trump to impose secondary tariffs on Chinese goods would be much more challenging to fulfil. That's because US imports from China are worth five times as much as those from India, and a lot more of those imports are consumer goods such as toys, clothes and electronics. Secondary tariffs aimed at Beijing would also risk upsetting a much broader renegotiation of trade between the world's two biggest economies that Trump has been pursuing since his first term in office. He explains that it would be "very difficult" to peel the Chinese away from the Russians without a good reason, given how closely Presidents Xi and Putin have worked together in recent years. On top of that, the last time Trump tried using triple-figure tariffs against China, he found it did not work - as it almost cut off all trade between the two countries. Further harm to US-EU commerce Analysis by the Finland-based Centre for Research and Clean Air shows that the EU and Turkey are also still amongst the biggest buyers of Russian energy. In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, acknowledged the problem, saying "Russia has repeatedly attempted to blackmail us by weaponizing its energy supplies" as she laid out plans to end imports by the end of 2027. The US-EU trade relationship is the biggest in the world, and the pair have just negotiated new trade terms which will see a 15% tariff be applied on most EU exports to the US.

Article: The quest to create gene-edited babies gets a reboot toggle caption VICTOR HABBICK VISIONS/Science Photo Library/Getty Images A Chinese scientist horrified the world in 2018 when he revealed he had secretly engineered the birth of the world's first gene-edited babies. Now, however, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, futurists, East Coast entrepreneurs, and pronatalists — who fear falling birth rates pose an existential threat to the human race — are eager to push the technology forward. "We want to be the company that does this in the light, with transparency and with good intentions," Cathy Tie, a biotech entrepreneur, told NPR in an interview about her new company, dubbed: Manhattan Project. We believe the scale of our mission, to end genetic disease, is just as significant as the original science behind Manhattan Project." Tie said she plans to move slowly and carefully, with stringent bioethical oversight, to explore a variety of gene-editing technologies. "Right now the goal is really just to inform regulators and the public what this technology is capable of — and what it's not — and hopefully empower regulators in the future, when proven safe and efficient, to allow research in this space," Tie said. "And I think that we have the responsibility to talk about this with patients that do have these terrible diseases and see if they want the option to not pass that on to future generations. Parents should have the choice." But the company would not go beyond preventing illnesses, such as the genetic lung disease cystic fibrosis and the inherited blood disorder beta thalassemia, she said. "We draw the line at disease prevention." She co-founded the firm with Eriona Hysolli, who headed biological sciences at Colossal Biosciences, which is working on a controversial project to use gene-editing to bring back extinct animals like the wooly mammoth. "I truly believe that these tools are very powerful and can lead to benefits to human health." The Manhattan Project did not reveal more details, including how much money had been raised, the investors or a timeline. Sponsor Message "We are definitely evaluating whether it makes sense to actually incubate and help build a company that we think could do this safely and responsibly," said Lucas Harrington, who co-founded SciFounders, a San Francisco venture capital firm. "I think there's huge benefit if it can be done safely and responsibly." Harrington envisions using newer and hopefully safer gene-editing techniques, such as "base editing," to modify embryos to make babies. The Chinese scientist used the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA much more easily than ever before but can cause potentially dangerous random mutations. "I think how we've been going about it until now has really been burying our head in the sand and not wanting to talk about it because it's too controversial," Harrington said. "The good that Bootstrap Bio can do is to basically speed up the development of this technology and also expand people's conception of what biotech is actually good for," said Chase Denecke, the CEO of the California startup Bootstrap Bio, Inc., on the podcast OpenSocietyWTF. "People can say, 'Well, you're playing God by using this type of technology.' And I say, 'People would say that with any technology of the past,' " said Malcolm Collins, a self-described pronatalist. "I'm really excited for a future within human history where there are some people that have decided to really lean into technologies like this," Malcolm Collins told NPR in an interview. And if people would like to start to do that at a genetic level they should have every right to do so." Room for painstaking science Many scientists favor carefully exploring the editing of DNA in human sperm, eggs and embryos to learn more about human reproduction and possibly someday prevent diseases. So I think that makes it even more dangerous and even more sinister." This new push comes as He Jiankui, the CRISPR babies scientist, has shifted from repentant to defiant since being released from prison. "Human heritable gene editing is clearly a terrible solution in search of a problem," said Tim Hunt, chief executive officer at the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, which along with the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy and the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy recently called for a 10-year moratorium on inheritable gene-editing. And I think that's a very dangerous way to approach these technologies," said Katie Hasson, the associate director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a genetics technology watchdog group in Berkeley, Calif. "I'm very worried that all of this together means we're headed straight into a new era of high-tech, market-based eugenics." But the Manhattan Project's Hysolli argues it would be unethical not to use the technology if it's safe.

Article: Trump-Modi ties hit rock bottom with new tariffs on India over Russian oil 58 minutes ago Share Save Vikas Pandey BBC News, Delhi Share Save Reuters Donald Trump has accused "good friend" India of funding Russia's war against Ukraine by purchasing its oil Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first world leaders to visit Washington weeks after US President Donald Trump started his second term. Trump has now imposed a total of 50% tariffs on goods imported from India, and his earlier threat of levying an extra 10% for the country's membership in the Brics grouping, which includes China, Russia and South Africa as founding members, still stands. He initially imposed a 25% tariff, but announced an additional 25% on Wednesday as a penalty for Delhi's purchase of Russian oil - a move the Indian government called "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable". Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump has warned of higher tariffs against India if it continues to buy Russian oil The US president hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir at the White House just weeks after a bitter conflict between the two South Asian rivals. "The fact that this is happening against the backdrop of heavy and high-level US engagement with Islamabad immediately after an India-Pakistan conflict is even more galling for Delhi and the wider Indian public. A source in the Indian government said that Delhi gave many concessions to Washington, including no tariffs on industrial goods, and a phased reduction of tariffs on cars and alcohol. Getty Images Delhi has said that India and Russia have a time-tested partnership But these sectors are a red line for Modi or, for that matter, any Indian prime minister. "We're seeing Trump continuing to ratchet up his pressure tactics, trying to cut Russia off from its most important oil buyers by penalising them for doing business with Moscow," he says. India is already the world's third biggest consumer of crude and may surpass China in the top position by 2030 as its energy demand is likely to increase with a fast-growing middle class, according to International Energy Agency (IEA). Many in the West see this as India indirectly funding Moscow's war but Delhi denies this, arguing that buying Russian oil at a discount ensures energy security for millions of its citizens. Moscow is also Delhi's biggest arms supplier, though its share in India's defence import portfolio dropped to 36% between 2020-25 from 55% between 2016 and 2020, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Article: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 38 Palestinians were killed overnight and into Wednesday in the Gaza Strip while seeking aid from United Nations convoys and sites run by an Israeli-backed American contractor, according to local health officials. READ MORE: Israeli minister visits flashpoint holy site as officials say 33 more aid-seekers killed in Gaza Another escalation of the nearly 22-month war could put the lives of countless Palestinians and around 20 living Israeli hostages at risk, and would draw fierce opposition both internationally and within Israel. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition allies have long called for the war to be expanded, and for Israel to eventually take over Gaza, relocate much of its population and rebuild Jewish settlements there. President Donald Trump, asked by a reporter Tuesday whether he supported the reoccupation of Gaza, said he wasn’t aware of the “suggestion” but that “it’s going to be pretty much up to Israel.” More Palestinians killed in scramble for food At least 28 Palestinians were killed overnight and into Wednesday in the Morag Corridor, an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where U.N. Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies, said another four people were killed in the Teina area, on a route leading to a site in southern Gaza run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American contractor. UN experts say Israeli-backed aid group should be dismantled Israel facilitated the establishment of four GHF sites in May after blocking the entry of all food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months. The United Nations, which has delivered aid to hundreds of distribution points across Gaza throughout the war when conditions allow, has rejected the new system, saying it forces Palestinians to travel long distances and risk their lives for food, and that it allows Israel to control who gets aid, potentially using it to advance plans for further mass displacement. special rapporteurs and independent human rights experts called for the GHF to be disbanded, saying it is “an utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law.” The experts work with the U.N. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots when crowds threatened its forces, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray and fired into the air on some occasions to prevent deadly crowding at its sites. Israel’s blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible for anyone to safely deliver aid, and aid groups say recent Israeli measures to facilitate more assistance are far from sufficient. Hospitals recorded four more malnutrition-related deaths over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 193 people, including 96 children, since the war began in October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Jordan says aid convoy attacked by Israeli settlers Jordan said Israeli settlers blocked roads and hurled stones at a convoy of four trucks carrying aid bound for Gaza after they drove across the border into the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.

Article: The news Shares of Apple jumped nearly 6% on Wednesday after a White House official confirmed to CNBC that the tech giant will raise its investment in United States manufacturing by another $100 billion to a total of $600 billion over the next four years. Apple also faces significant legal challenges: a Justice Department antitrust case against Alphabet that threatens billions of dollars in annual payments for Google search priority, and a years-long legal battle with Epic Games over App Store commissions. Last week, Apple reported a killer quarter , which bought the company and the stock more time to clarify its AI strategy and deal with the looming legal and tariff headwinds. On [last] Thursday evening's post-earnings call, Cook projected a $1.1 billion negative effect from tariffs in the September quarter, assuming no changes." That "assuming no changes" part has been the wildcard since Trump started all the tariffs talk. Bottom line Jim has been saying for months and months that Apple must get right with Trump, who does not seem to care about the company's previous commitment or the two dozen factories that Apple had already planned to open. They'd just have to recreate the entire thing, and what the president is going to say is, 'Listen, I know you don't want to do it, but we want it. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Article: Apple to invest $100bn after pressure from Trump 11 minutes ago Share Save Natalie Sherman BBC News Share Save AFP/Getty Trump and Apple boss Tim Cook tour a manufacturing facility in 2019, when Apple avoided tariffs on its products after announcing investments in the US Apple is planning to boost investments in its home country by another $100bn (£750m) as it comes under pressure from the Trump administration to do more manufacturing in the US. The White House said the money would be used to encourage firms to make more Apple parts in the US and would add to the company's previous pledge to spend $500bn in the US over four years. On an investor call last week, chief executive Tim Cook referenced the company's earlier commitment and said it was looking to "do more" as it tries to avoid a wave of tariffs poised to hit its products. Earlier this spring President Donald Trump singled out Apple by name, threatening to raise tariffs on the company's products if it did not move manufacturing of its iPhones to the US. Analysts said any significant change to Apple's supply chain would take time, but the company's promise might help it win lighter treatment from the White House, given Trump's focus on increasing business investments in the US. "Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security," spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.

Moscow and Washington are still signatories to multilateral international treaties that aim to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons, but the increasingly erratic relationship between the countries, combined with the dwindling treaties, has many worried. and Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I, or SALT I, which was the first treaty that placed limits on the number of missiles, bombers and submarines carrying nuclear weapons. and Russia in the immediate future are “highly unlikely” because the level of trust necessary to negotiate and follow through with an arms control agreement does not exist, Kaushal at RUSI said. and Russia, it could drive a “competitive spiral” in which Washington could develop more nuclear, as well as conventional, weapons to counter what it perceives as a threat from Beijing, Kaushal said.

Article: Tea Dating Advice, an app designed as a safe space for women to anonymously discuss men they’ve dated, faces mounting legal challenges after a data breach last month exposed users’ personal information and images. The women who filed the suits accuse Tea Dating Advice Inc., the company behind the viral app, of failing to properly safeguard their personally identifiable information after images of users’ government IDs containing their full names and addresses were leaked online. Founded in 2023, the Tea app says it allows users to perform criminal background checks on potential dates, enter photos from a dating app profile into a reverse image search and search dates’ phone numbers. Advertisement The hack was first reported by 404 Media, which said users on the online forum 4chan claimed to have uploaded the images of women and their IDs to the site, long known for its discussion boards containing racist, extremist and misogynistic content. The app, “which marketed itself as a sanctuary where women could anonymously warn each other about dangerous men, instead became the very threat it promised to protect against,” one lawsuit, filed by a woman listed anonymously as Jane Doe, reads. The women behind the lawsuits include a single mother from Nevada fleeing domestic violence, as well as a woman from Northern California who used the app to warn others about a man who allegedly sexually assaulted two women in her community, according to court documents. Advertisement A third plaintiff, Griselda Reyes, says in her complaint that she now “has anxiety and increased concerns for the loss of privacy, as well as anxiety over the impact of cybercriminals accessing, using and selling” her private information. In a July statement, Tea said that it had detected “unauthorized access to our systems” and about 72,000 images had been exposed, including some 13,000 images of photo identification documents and selfies submitted as part of the user verification process.

Article: It is the latest attempt by Italian officials to launch the Messina Bridge project - several have tried over the years but plans have later been scrapped due to concerns over cost, environmental damage, safety or potential mafia meddling. The designers claim the bridge – which is due to be built on one of the most seismically active areas in the Mediterranean – will be able to withstand earthquakes. Rome has given final approval to a €13.5bn ($15.6bn) project to build the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting the island of Sicily to the region of Calabria, on the tip of Italy's boot. According to the final project, the bridge over the Messina strait will span 3.3km (2.05 miles) and stretch between two 400-metre (1,300 feet) high towers, with two railway lines in the middle will run and three lanes of traffic on either side. Transport minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing Lega party and a government ally of Meloni, celebrated the milestone, saying that the goal was to complete the bridge between 2032 and 2033. Since the first plans for it were drawn up more than 50 years ago, various ideas for it have had to be shelved for various reasons and it has long faced stern opposition. This has included concerns that huge amounts of taxpayers' money would be siphoned off by the Sicilian and Calabrian mafias, which have a broad influence over politics and society in southern Italy.

Osi Umenyiora and Efe Obada are two of those who have been born overseas and proved it is possible to pick up the game late and still succeed, but you must be able to understand a playbook. During a video call with BBC Sport, the 32-year-old held up two law books - each more than an inch thick - and said: "Learning both of these was easier than learning an NFL playbook, which is absolutely absurd. It recalibrates what you think is hard." Speaking to the BBC after beginning his NFL journey in 2018, Christian Wade held his hands several inches apart and said "the playbook's like this".

Article: ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Egypt’s foreign minister, on a visit to Greece on Wednesday, described the international response to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza as shameful and urged powerful Western nations to increase pressure on Israel. “The international community should be ashamed of the tragic situation unfolding in Gaza and the devastating actions being carried out by Israel,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told reporters in Athens. Widespread reports of hunger in Gaza have heightened international concern over the devastating consequences of Israeli military operations launched nearly two years ago, following deadly attacks by Hamas-led militants inside Israel on Oct. READ MORE: Dozens killed seeking aid in Gaza as Israel considers further military action The Egyptian minister described Israel’s military campaign in the territory as a “systematic genocide,” but reiterated his government’s position that it “firmly rejects any displacement of the Palestinian people from their ancestral lands.” Abdelatty held a two-hour meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis to discuss a planned undersea electricity grid connector between the two countries and an ongoing dispute between Greece and Libya over sea boundaries for offshore oil and gas exploration.

Article: WATCH: What’s behind the recent surge in mosquito-borne illnesses The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions. “This suggests that most of the population had no preexisting immunity, making it easier for the virus to spread quickly.” In response to the outbreak in Foshan, near Hong Kong, Chinese authorities have begun taking measures like distributing mosquito nets, having workers spray residential areas, streets and construction sites with insecticide. People who do not empty bottles, flower pots or other outdoor receptacles, where water might accumulate and allow mosquitoes to breed, can be subject to fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,400) and have their electricity cut off. The number of outbreaks has increased since 2000, just as there have been more outbreaks of other mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue and Zika, according to Robert Jones, an assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Jones said the risks of chikungunya epidemics have risen due to climate change and urban expansion, warning that the current outbreak could spread to other parts of southern China with humid climates and dense cities.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

Claire's Chapter 11 filing follows the bankruptcies of other teen retailers including Forever 21, which filed in March for bankruptcy protection for a second time and eventually closed down its U.S. Claire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois and founded in 1974, said that its stores in North America will remain open and will continue to serve customers, while it explores all strategic alternatives. “Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire’s and its stakeholders.” Like many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said.

(Vertical Entertainment via AP) Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. But it’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work. It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I’ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she’s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto). Miller’s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest “Dame Of Darkness” is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. There’s lots of fretting over why Katherine won’t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. But coherency of the vision is limited, as is the audience’s investment, though there are some lovely and inspired touches like using Iranian artist Reza Riahi to hand paint several animated flashback vignettes based on her memories of her fathers. Thomas co-wrote the script with her husband, journalist John Micklethwait, which includes a particularly poignant monologue for her character telling her daughters, essentially, to grow up and move on — a mature and worthy statement that might come a bit too late. But Thomas did have the good sense to end with a song that might just conjure up some feelings for any “Heartburn” fans out there: Carly Simon’s “Coming Around Again,” this time a duet with Alanis Morissette.

The plan is to be presented to the cabinet by the end of this month for discussion and approval, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam told a press conference after the six-hour cabinet meeting. In June, American officials presented a roadmap to Lebanese authorities that proposed Hezbollah's full disarmament in exchange for Israel halting its strikes and withdrawing troops from five locations in southern Lebanon, which have been occupied despite a ceasefire deal reached in November. The group's leader, Naim Qassem, in a televised address while the cabinet meeting was underway, said Hezbollah would not discuss "the issue of the weapons" while Israeli attacks continue, accusing Israel of breaching the terms of the ceasefire. Despite its weakened status, Hezbollah still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia Muslim population, and discussions around its disarmament risk elevating tensions in the country, where many still remember the 1975-1990 civil war.

Article: Public health experts dismayed by RFK Jr.'s defunding of mRNA vaccine research toggle caption Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg/Getty Images The Trump administration is cancelling almost $500 million in contracts to develop mRNA vaccines to protect the nation against future viral threats. The federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, which oversees the nation's defenses against biological attacks, is terminating 22 contracts with university researchers and private companies to develop new uses for the mRNA technology, Health Secretary Robert F. The mRNA technology was used by the first Trump administration to create the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, which are widely considered a medical triumph that safely and effectively saved millions of lives. "This may be the most dangerous public health judgment that I've seen in my 50 years in this business," says Michael Osterholm, who runs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "While we believe the mRNA vaccines should be taken off the market, the announcement is a positive move towards protecting public health," said Mary Holland, the group's president and CEO, in a statement. "It could put the US at a strategic national security disadvantage and would be a significant threat to the national security of the United States." In announcing his decision, Kennedy claimed the COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe, ineffective, helped drive the evolution of the virus and could not keep up with new mutations. Kennedy says the federal government is instead investing in an alternative technology that uses whole killed viruses and can produce "natural immunity." While that technology has produced effective vaccines, it's a much older approach that can have safety issues and is not nearly as nimble in responding to new threats, experts say. "It is irresponsible to strip funding from future technologies with great potential and shift it towards outdated old fashioned technologies," says Rick Bright, who ran BARDA during the first Trump administration. "We're taking our country from 2025 back to 1940 and we all know that's a recipe for disaster and failure." Sponsor Message The mRNA technology is the only vaccine technology that can be developed quickly enough to respond swiftly to a new pathogenic threat, experts say. "In an outbreak, when you are facing a rapidly spreading virus – whether it's from nature or a nation-state adversary – speed is the name of the game," Bright says. "The deleterious impact is not only in the contracts that they're canceling but they're trying to make the case to the public that mRNA technology doesn't work very well and it's unsafe," Hotez says.

Article: President Donald Trump points towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holding a document during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Reuters Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation last week brought back a scenario that seemed to be fading but could have important ramifications for how the central bank conducts policy. With the open seat on the influential central bank board, President Donald Trump now has a number of strategic options, including one where he could appoint a so-called shadow chair whose job would be largely to serve as an instigator until a successor to current Chair Jerome Powell could be named. Will Trump use the position to nominate a gadfly to torment Powell, a frequent target of blistering criticism from the president, or pursue a different strategy focused more on the long-term direction of the Fed? One is he can put a stop-gap appointment to fill the Kugler seat for the remaining four months of the unexpired term," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said Wednesday on CNBC. "Or he could just decide to compress the entire process and pick the person he wants to be the Fed chair now." watch now Kugler's decision to leave the Fed with little notice would be important under normal circumstances, but the nature of her situation on the board raises the ante. Taking into account the Senate calendar, the new governor would serve at best three or four months, then have to undergo yet another confirmation hearing should Trump decide to reappoint the person. While Trump could be tempted to go the shadow-chair route — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the past has advocated for that course — it might be an unappetizing choice for the nominee. So he might be tempted with the idea of putting somebody in the seat for a few months, see how they do, if they pass the audition, then be given the nod for the next Fed chair. If she had stayed in the seat, the appointment wouldn't have come at least until her term expired in January and would have been for a full 14-year term on the board. Former Fed Chair and past Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on CNBC that Trump's rate demands "should be frightening to markets." "A shadow chairman with only four months to go has some risk," said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel.

"And then they did a revision about two weeks later, and the revision was down by almost 900,000 jobs," he alleged. When a host pushed back, Trump doubled down, claiming "the numbers were rigged." watch now "They announced these phenomenal numbers the two days before the election and a little bit before that, always these great numbers ... "New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID," he claimed in an Aug. "America is a Nation in Decline because Sleepy Joe, and Lyin' Kamala, didn't do their job." The BLS would later revise that weak jobs figure upward — but not until after Trump had won the election. A Labor Department official, in comments provided by the White House, criticized McEntarfer's leadership, saying that she waited too long to inform the department about data-collection challenges at the BLS. Instead, Trump announced McEntarfer's firing in a Friday afternoon social media post that accused her of having "faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory." CNBC has reached out to McEntarfer for comment. "Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes." The post came hours after the initial jobs report for the month of July showed weaker-than-expected growth.

Article: Not as attractions, but for food toggle caption Henning Bagger/AFP via Getty Images A European zoo stirred up intrigue and controversy after a social media post asking for surplus pets to be donated to feed captive animals went viral. "Chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs form an important part of the diet of our predators – especially the European lynx, which needs whole prey that resembles what it would naturally hunt in the wild," the zoo wrote. "That way, nothing goes to waste - and we ensure natural behavior, nutrition and well-being of our predators." Sponsor Message The zoo also accepts horses as part of its fodder program. The Facebook post quickly became a battleground between commenters who were appalled at the concept of euthanizing healthy pets for animal feed, and those who applauded the zoo for its method of maintaining a practical food supply for its animals. "No one would bring his healthy pet to a zoo so they can kill it and feed it to their animals." "In Denmark, this practice is common" The Aalborg Zoo says dogs and cats are excluded from the program. "When keeping carnivores, it is necessary to provide them with meat, preferably with fur, bones, etc., to give them as natural a diet as possible," zoo Deputy Director Pia Nielsen said in a statement to NPR. What experts say Experts say that it is important for captive animals to be fed whole animal parts, including fur, bones and organs, to maintain the sort of eating habits they would exhibit in the wild. Sponsor Message "The problem with just feeding lions meat is that the offal (liver, heart, etc.) is much richer in various nutrients than muscle meat – wild lions only start eating the muscle tissue after they've finished the offal," Craig Packer, founder and director of the Lion Center at the University of Minnesota, told NPR in an email. "So feeding lions anything besides horse and cow meat would probably be a welcome change." The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) is an accreditation body for conservation programs in the United States. In 2015, the country's Odense Zoo made international headlines for its decision to kill and publicly dissect a 9-month-old female lion in front of school children, as a means to control the facility's lion population – a practice the zoo had been carrying on for decades. A year before in the capital city of Copenhagen, animal rights activists were horrified to learn that a healthy two-year-old giraffe known as Marius had been euthanized and his remains fed to the zoo's lions.

Article: See today's video update from Mike above.) Another day of mild churn in the market under the surface of a headline S & P 500 rally that was largely propelled by Apple shares. The S & P 500 has spent the week in the range, bounded by last Thursday's all-time high above 6400 and Friday's low near 6200, set after the shock of that jarringly weak July employment report. Even after today's jump, Apple stock is lagging the performance of the Nasdaq-100 by 25 percentage points so far this year – representing plenty of room for catch-up but also reflecting the market's skepticism of the company's answer to the AI boom. The 10-year Treasury yield is holding just above 4.2% , a level it's spent very little time below over the past year except when the market was undergoing a "growth scare" (last summer/fall and in the April tariff panic). A sharp twitch higher in yield just before noon seemed to coincide with a sudden drop in the prediction-market odds of former Fed governor Kevin Warsh being nominated by President Trump as the next Fed chair. Unclear if the Treasury market will continue to key off of this horserace; perhaps only in the absence of macro inputs such as tomorrow's weekly jobless claims and next Tuesday's July CPI report.

Article: Wrong remains from Air India crash 'adds to trauma', says family 6 minutes ago Share Save Thomas Mackintosh BBC News Share Save Instagram Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, who ran a spiritual wellness centre in Ramsgate, were among the dead in the Air India plane crash A woman whose brother died in the Air India crash and then received the wrong body says it has "added trauma" to her family. Fiongal Greenlaw-Meek, 39, and his husband Jamie, 45, were among the 242 people on board the flight which crashed on 12 June soon after taking off for London Gatwick from Ahmedabad. The Foreign Office said it continues to support families affected by the Air India crash with "dedicated caseworkers", adding that the "formal identification of bodies is a matter for the Indian authorities". "Somebody mislabelled remains - that has added trauma." She said it appeared there was a "lack of forensic protocols" at the scene of the crash, and the site was "not closed for 48 hours". It was shocking and is confusing." There were 230 passengers and 12 crew on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, including 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian. Many people living in a residential neighbourhood near Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport where the jet came down were also killed, taking the number of confirmed casualties to at least 270. "She went straight to the hospital to give a blood sample, we were told it would be up to 72 hours to get a positive identification - and that was about right. I think for her that made it more real to be able to see that." Arwen Greenlaw Ms Greenlaw explained when the casket was returned it was tested and found to be "the remains of two different people". As a result, a coroner in London decided to carry out further tests and the family were able to get some DNA from Fiongal's headphones that proved the remains were not his. If he had not been matched we could get our heads around that." EPA Investigators are still trying to establish the cause of the crash Mr Greenlaw-Meeks founded The Wellness Foundry in Ramsgate, in Kent, in 2018 with his husband joining as a managing director five years later. Moments before boarding the Air India flight, the pair posted a video to social media on their last night in the country, where Mr Greenlaw-Meeks reflected on a "magical experience". They were two halves of one." The Foreign Office told the BBC it is continuing to liaise with the Gujarati government and the Indian government on behalf of the Inner West London Senior Coroner to support the coronial process. "We have allocated dedicated caseworkers to each family who wish to have one." Ms Greenlaw's comments come days after a separate memorial service was held on Sunday in Wembley to remember two other victims who died on the flight - Ashok and Shobhana Patel.

Article: BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) — Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow’s state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic’s government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow’s demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. WATCH: ‘Putin’s Sledgehammer’ reveals how the Wagner Group became so powerful it threatened him A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). “Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Article: MILAN (AP) — Italy cleared the way Wednesday to build the world’s largest suspension bridge linking the Italian mainland with Sicily in a massive 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) infrastructure project that has been long delayed by debates over its scale, earthquake threats, environmental impact and the spectre of mafia interference. The Strait of Messina Bridge will be “the biggest infrastructure project in the West,” Transport Minister Matteo Salvini told a news conference in Rome, after an interministerial committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the project. Premier Giorgia Meloni said that the bridge “will be an engineering symbol of global significance.” Salvini cited studies showing the project will create 120,000 jobs a year and accelerate growth in economically lagging southern Italy, as billions more in investments are made in roads and other infrastructure projects accompanying the bridge. READ MORE: Venice protesters say Bezos’ star-studded wedding highlights growing inequality Preliminary work could begin between late September and early October, once Italy’s court of audit signs off, with construction expected to start next year. The Strait of Messina Bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.2 miles), with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometers (more than 2 miles), surpassing Turkey’s Canakkale Bridge, currently the longest, by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet). With three car lanes in each direction flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 cars an hour and 200 trains a day — reducing the time to cross the strait by ferry from up to 100 minutes to 10 minutes by car. The project could provide a boost to Italy’s commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related, helping it to meet a 1.5% security component. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO’s southern flanks, qualifying it as a “security-enhancing infrastructure.” READ MORE: NATO leaders agree to hike military spending and restate ‘ironclad commitment’ to collective defense if attacked Salvini confirmed the intention to classify the project as dual use, but said that was up to Italy’s defense and economic ministers. A group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use. Concerns over organized crime Environmental groups have lodged complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies had not demonstrated that the project is a public imperative and that any environmental damage would be offset. But Italy’s president insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy out of concerns that the ad-hoc arrangement would weaken controls. Salvini pledged that keeping organized crime out of the project was top priority, saying it would adhere to the same protocols used for the Expo 2015 World’s Fair and the upcoming Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. The project has been awarded to a consortium led by Webuild, an Italian infrastructure group that initially won the bid to build the bridge in 2006 before it was later canceled. The Canakkale Bridge, which opened in 2022, was built using an engineering design similar to the one devised for the Messina bridge, including a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to allow wind to pass through the structure, according to Webuild. Addressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, Webuild has emphasized that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces.

Yet, when Garner’s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage. “We definitely have a, ‘Whoa, not my problem,’ kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we’re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it’s happening in front of us,” Cregger said. “Living in America, I’ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I’ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don’t know, it feels real.” Brolin — who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, “The Goonies,” to the Marvel universe — initially hesitated when approached for the film. How do you deal?” For Ehrenreich, who’s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, “Weapons” offered a different pace, but its horror wasn’t what drew him in. “The weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I’ve read in years,” Ehrenreich said.

Article: President Donald Trump said Wednesday he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are "building in the United States." The announcement of new sector-specific tariffs shows Trump ratcheting up his efforts to pressure businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. "But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge," he said.

Article: college students without legal residency are losing access to in-state tuition as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration What to know as Trump's immigration crackdown strips tuition breaks from thousands of students Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks at a news conference at the Drug Enforcement Administration, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Arlington, Va. Last year, Florida ended its tuition break for students living there illegally, “Federal law prohibits aliens not lawfully present in the United States from getting in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. The law allowed students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they had lived in Texas for three years before graduating from high school and for a year before enrolling in college. Texas now has about 57,000 qualifying students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. For example, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a 34,000-student campus along the border with Mexico, a state resident will pay about $10,000 in basic tuition for a minimum full-time class schedule in the upcoming school year. After the Trump administration filed a lawsuit calling the law unconstitutional, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a key Trump ally, chose not to defend the law in court and instead filed a motion agreeing that it should not be enforced. “Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful," Drummond said in a statement. At least 21 states and the University of Michigan system have laws or policies allowing tuition breaks for the immigrant students, according to the National Immigration Law Center, which favors them.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Apple CEO Tim Cook joined President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a commitment by the tech company to increase its investment in U.S. “This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America,” Trump said at the press conference. “Today’s announcement is one of the largest commitments in what has become among the greatest investment booms in our nation’s history.” As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the United States as part of an initiative called the American Manufacturing Program, but it is not a full commitment to build its popular iPhone device domestically. They produce components — semiconductor chips included — that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we’re grateful to the President for his support,” Cook said in a statement announcing the investment. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and Cook for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was “a little problem” with the Cupertino, California, company and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, “I don’t want you building in India.” India has incurred Trump’s wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world’s most populous country for its use of Russian oil. Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that “there’s a load of different things done in the United States.” As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the U.S. “We’re doing more in this country, and that’s on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more,” Cook told analysts last week, without elaborating. That gains reflect investors’ relief that Cook “is extending an olive branch” to the Trump administration, said Nancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns Apple stock. Despite Wednesday’s upturn, Apple’s shares are still down by 14% this year, a reversal of fortune that has also been driven by the company’s botched start in the pivotal field of artificial intelligence.

Article: Trump announced late Wednesday that there would be a 100% tariff on imported chips, but not for companies that are "building in the United States." News of the levy comes after Apple announced a plan to spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. "But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge." Stocks are coming off of a positive session, aided by a 5% jump in Apple on Wednesday. The president said the hike is because India continues to buy Russian oil, a sign that he is following through on his threats to punish Russia's trade partners unless a Ukraine peace deal is reached by September. Prior to Wednesday's modest gains, the S&P 500 had notched five losing sessions over the past six trading days, and the Dow had had six negative days in the past seven.

Maryland David Moon, the majority leader of Maryland’s House of Delegates, plans to introduce a bill that would allow Maryland to embark on redistricting if any other state did the same “outside of the regular decennial census period.” Only one of Maryland’s eight House seats is held by a Republican, though, and Republican legislators have blasted any such proposal, which they said would lead to “absolutely zero Republican representation.” Turning that one seat blue would be tricky, since mapmakers would have to stretch that district from the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay to the Democratic western side. Kathy Hochul has suggested that she is willing to disband with the redistricting commission, arguing in an essay for The Houston Chronicle on Tuesday, “If they get away with it now, 2026 will be the first of many stolen elections.” New Jersey Gov.

"We initially try to engage with the owner, but when it becomes a detrimental impact to the wider neighbourhood, then we have to take enforcement action to stop that decline." Law change call If the property has been empty for more than two years, and the owner is not cooperating, councils can apply for an Empty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO).

He also said, "That includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too." When asked whether the administration wants to overturn D.C.'s home rule — a form of limited self-government that the city has operated under for half a century — Trump said, "We're going to look at that. In fact the lawyers are already studying it." Sponsor Message The former DOGE staffer whose assault led to Trump's remarks is Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old nicknamed "Big Balls." Coristine worked for the General Services Administration (GSA) — where he was granted access to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment data — until his resignation in June, as NPR has reported. According to a Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) incident report shared with NPR, Coristine was standing with a woman near his car in an area of Logan Circle — a neighborhood in northwest D.C. The suspects then began to assault [Coristine]." Most of the suspects fled on foot as patrolling police arrived, though the MPD said officers arrested two of them — both 15 years old — at the scene and charged them with unarmed carjacking. What happened to Coristine is relatively unusual, but it provided a political opportunity for Trump, says George Derek Musgrove, an associate history professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the co-author of Chocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital.

"The city doesn't particularly like him and he doesn't particularly like the city," says Musgrove. residents more control over their own affairs — such as the right to elect a mayor and city council members — but maintained Congressional oversight over things like the city's budget and legislation. So it is within the realm of possibility." Sponsor Message But Musgrove also questions how much Trump really wants the federal government to be tasked with the minutiae of city governance, like trash pickups and filling potholes, especially since he can exert power over local government in other ways. It also allows the president to use D.C.'s police force for up to 30 days if he "determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes" — though he needs to get Congressional approval to use the services of the police force for more than 48 hours, according to city code. police officers to quell local Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, suggesting that the federal government would have "total domination" over the city, according to a CNN transcript of a call he had with U.S. More broadly, Musgrove says home rule — and specifically, the threat of Trump pushing Congress to repeal it — gives Trump leverage in negotiations with D.C.'s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser. While Bowser has long been vocally critical of Trump, she's also complied with some of his demands in recent months, such as clearing homeless encampments and removing a "Black Lives Matter" street mural near the White House, after facing pressure from the administration and Congress.

He doubled already hefty tariffs on Indian exports to the United States for its steadfast refusal to stop buying oil from Russia, in an effort to pressure Russia to end the war. Trump has accused India of helping Russia finance its war on Ukraine through oil purchases; India has said it needs cheap oil to meet the energy needs of its fast-growing economy. India called the additional tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” pointing out that it was being punished for doing something — buying Russian oil at a discounted price — that other nations have done, although it didn’t mention names. China is the largest buyer of Russian oil, and Turkey has also deepened its energy links with Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, without incurring similar penalties.

Article: Rayner asks China to explain redacted embassy plans 15 minutes ago Share Save Chris Graham BBC News Share Save EPA China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018 Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to explain why parts of its plans for a new mega-embassy in London are redacted. In a letter seen by the PA news agency, Rayner, who as housing secretary is responsible for overseeing planning matters, asks planning consultants representing the Chinese embassy to explain why drawings of the planned site are blacked out. It notes that the Home Office requested a new "hard perimeter" be placed around the embassy site, to prevent "unregulated public access", and says this could require a further planning application. There are concerns, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.

Under the new proposals, only qualified health professionals will be able to carry out risky non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) and clinics will need to meet strict rules to obtain licences to offer fillers and Botox. The government says it will bring in regulations for the most dangerous procedures first - such as breast fillers and BBLs - which means only some qualified health professionals will be able to perform them. She said the government was taking action to protect people, support honest practitioners and root out the unqualified, dangerous ones, while also reducing the costs to the NHS of fixing botched procedures.

Article: Badenoch reveals how she told on exam cheat as teenager 34 minutes ago Share Save Brian Wheeler Political reporter Share Save Watch: Kemi Badenoch says she "didn't get praised" for accusing fellow pupil of cheating Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has told the BBC how she stood up in an exam and accused a fellow pupil of cheating, leading to him being expelled from school. Speaking about her hatred of rule-breakers, she said she was "about 14 or 15" when she stood up in an exam and said "'he's cheating, he's the one that's doing it', and that boy ended up getting expelled". I was a relatively popular kid at school, and people said 'why did you do that, why would you do it?' "I said 'because he was doing the wrong thing'." Elsewhere in the interview, she talks about how she lost her faith in God but still considers herself a "cultural Christian" and about the lack of ambition some teachers in the UK had for black children in the 1990s. She returned to the UK when she was 16 to live with a family friend because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria and, she tells Rajan, because she "really, really" wanted to be in London. Last week, she said she no longer identified as Nigerian - a comment that elicited a strong reaction in Nigeria, with a number of political figures accusing her of continually portraying the country in bad light. In her interview, she speaks about the "poverty of low expectations" she says she encountered at college in London, when she says black children were steered towards vocational qualifications rather than A-Levels, and discouraged from applying for Oxford and Cambridge. The BBC has spoken to the principal of Badenoch's college at the time, who said the college was "trying to do the best for every individual student, regardless of their background" and the Tory leader's comment on low expectations "just sounds like rhetoric to reinforce her political narrative". When this was put to her by Rajan, Badenoch insisted it was not just political rhetoric, and that "if people deny that these things happen, we're never going to fix it". It is not worth it.' "That is not right." 'I rejected God' Badenoch completed a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University and worked in finance and IT before entering politics. When he was dying of a brain tumour in 2022, Badenoch says: "He cried because he knew he was dying and he said, 'I know that you're going to go all the way, and I know I'm not going to be there to see it'. And that was really sad." She also speaks about losing her faith in God after watching coverage of the arrest of Austrian man Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter captive for 24 years in a dungeon he built beneath his home. So I would still define myself as a cultural Christian." Since Badenoch became leader in November last year, the Conservatives have lost control of 10 local authorities to Nigel Farage's Reform UK, and slumped to third or fourth place in national opinion polls.

Article: Inner London to lose out in funding rebalance - report 28 minutes ago Share Save Paul Seddon Political reporter Share Save Getty Images Councils in inner London are set to become the biggest losers under a government plan to update council funding rules, a think tank says. The new funding system, to be phased in over three years from 2026, will see changes to the formulas used by government to capture levels of demand for council-run services, along with the differing cost of delivering them. A greater share of funding will be redirected towards areas with a higher share of properties in lower council tax bands, whilst the portion of business rates income that councils have been allowed to keep since 2013 will be redistributed. But the think tank said Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth and Westminster would see their overall funding drop by 11–12%, even accounting for a proposed funding floor to limit losses. Areas with relatively high - but not the highest - population densities are also set to fare well, it estimates, including outer London boroughs and councils in Blackpool, Nottingham and Slough. It added that the widest range of outcomes would be seen in shire district councils, where some councils where business rate income has grown most, such as Mid Suffolk and North West Leicestershire, would lose out. "The government is moving the pain of chronic council underfunding from one community to another instead of delivering the economic growth that would deliver the revenue to fund local services everywhere," added deputy leader Daisy Cooper. 'Decisive action' A spokesperson for the local government department said: "The current, outdated way in which local authorities are funded means the link between funding and need for services has broken down, leaving communities left behind.

Article: Stanford University’s student-run newspaper sued two senior Trump administration officials Wednesday to prevent the deportation of noncitizen students on the basis of their speech, taking aim at a federal law the administration has used to justify students’ arrests. The lawsuit argues that it is unconstitutional for Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lean on the Immigration and Nationality Act to revoke students’ visas or try to deport them if he believes they undermine U.S. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which seeks to protect free speech on campuses, filed the complaint on behalf of the Stanford Daily and two former unnamed college students. “Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Trump administration are trying to turn the inalienable human right of free speech into a privilege contingent upon the whims of a federal bureaucrat, triggering deportation proceedings against noncitizens residing lawfully in this country for their protected political speech regarding American and Israeli foreign policy,” the lawsuit says. “If the administration were targeting people who actually committed crimes, who actually committed deportable offenses, we would be having a very different conversation,” said Conor Fitzpatrick, supervising senior attorney at FIRE. “But this is an administration that is brazenly going after law-abiding noncitizens for doing nothing more than voicing an opinion that the government of the day doesn’t like.” Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Since March, the government has detained Mahmoud Khalil, who was a student at Columbia University; Rumeysa Ozturk, a graduate student at Tufts University; and Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University. Advertisement At Stanford, international students’ fear of having their visas revoked or being deported for being associated with certain viewpoints has impacted their right to free speech, the lawsuit argues. Greta Reich, editor in chief of the Stanford Daily, said in a statement that student reporters fear “being associated with speaking on political topics, even in a journalistic capacity.” She previously told The Post that international students are also reluctant to be quoted in the newspaper. The lawsuit alleges Canary Mission — a website that publishes a list of people and groups it says “promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews” on campuses — published her name after she posted pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel commentary online. Advertisement The other former student in the lawsuit, who also attended an unnamed school, said he chose not to publish a study criticizing the Israel’s government military operations in Gaza to also avoid being targeted by the U.S.

Article: A Nuyorican original, the pianist and bandleader Eddie Palmieri began his career playing in mambo orchestras at the tail end of the Palladium era — named for the Manhattan club on West 52nd Street where crowds flocked to dance to mambo orchestras with robust horn and percussion sections — using his eclectic training on piano to drive dancers to ecstatic heights. Ironically, Palmieri, who died on Wednesday at 88, like other bandleaders of his era, disliked the term, castigating it as a catchall that obscured foundational Afro-Cuban dance rhythms like son, guaracha, guaguancó, danzón and cha cha cha. Yet La Perfecta had a new twist that helped distinguish the New York style from Cuban music: a two-trombone gut punch provided by the Bronx-born Barry Rogers and the Brazilian-born José Rodrigues. Palmieri embraced the counterculture era’s strident politics with songs like “Justicia,” played a famous gig at Sing Sing prison upstate and, departing from salsa protocol, recorded an album called “Harlem River Drive” with the jazz drummer Bernard Purdie that evoked classics like War’s “The World Is a Ghetto.” He was a pianist driven by Afro-Caribbean percussion while also an acolyte of the music theorist Joseph Schillinger’s mathematical approach to composition. Featuring the brash virtuosity of the Rogers-Rodrigues trombone combo, Ismael Quintana’s distinctive vocals, Manny Oquendo’s precision percussion and Palmieri’s double-time piano pounding, it goes from call-and-response to blissful jam session.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta), File) FILE -President Donald Trump listens as Rwanda's Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe speaks during a event with Congo's Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner, June 27, 2025, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, as Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, watch. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta), File) WASHINGTON -- Although President Donald Trump has not directly said he thinks JD Vance should be the heir to his “Make America Great Again” base of support, he acknowledged this week that his vice president is probably the favorite to succeed him “at this point.” But even as he promoted Vance, Trump also made sure to mention Secretary of State Marco Rubio, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday that his administration's top diplomat is “somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form” on a future political ticket. Not definitively anointing Vance, or any other Republican, keeps those hoping to succeed Trump vying for his favor, both inside his administration and in the wider Republican field of possible contenders. Speaking with reporters following an executive order signing at the White House, Trump was asked if Vance were the “heir apparent to MAGA.” “I think most likely, in all fairness, he’s the vice president," Trump said. It’s too early obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he’s doing a great job and he would be, probably favorite at this point.” When Trump selected the then-39-year-old Vance over other more established Republicans — including Rubio — as his running mate last year, many theorized that Trump was planning for the future of his political movement, angling for a vice president who could carry MAGA forward. Vance has embraced the role at every turn, doing the president's bidding on everything from his relationship with Ukraine to the fight over records related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. As the White House promotes mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas — and acknowledges it would like the notion to expand to other states — Vance is expected Thursday to discuss redrawing district lines with Gov. In June he traveled to Los Angeles trip to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center amid clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and looting following immigration raids across Southern California. And earlier this year, Vance was in swing congressional districts in his role as lead cheerleader for Trump’s signature tax cut and spending law, an assortment of conservative priorities that Republicans dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” He also lobbied senators on Capitol Hill, working to swing GOP holdouts to support the legislation, and in July cast a tie-breaking vote to get the measure passed in the Senate. He's also taken on a robust role related to foreign policy, holding meetings of his own with world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a trip to New Delhi, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. Rubio, who has described Vance as among his closest friends in politics, said on Fox News Channel on Sunday that he felt Vance "would be a great nominee if he decides he wants to do that.” Other Republicans mentioned as possible 2028 contenders are already making the rounds of early-voting states. Brian Kemp — who has long harbored ambitions to run for president but has a complicated history with Trump — recently said he was sitting out of a Senate race in his state, a decision telegraphed by some as an indication Kemp might be eyeing the 2028 White House race.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal grants for the University of California, Los Angeles, nearly double the amount that was previously thought, the school’s chancellor announced Wednesday. “If these funds remain suspended, it will be devastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation,” Chancellor Julio Frenk said Wednesday in a statement, noting the groundbreaking research that has come out of the university. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division found UCLA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” The announcement came as UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued the university, arguing it violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters in 2024 to block their access to classes and other areas on campus. “Moreover, the extensive work that UCLA and the entire University of California have taken to combat antisemitism has apparently been ignored.” Milliken said the “cuts would be a death knell for innovative work that saves lives, grows our economy, and fortifies our national security. It is in our country’s best interest that funding be restored.” As part of the lawsuit settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university's Jewish community. Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

Amir Jalil Ali, who was arrested Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge, initially was charged in 1995 with killing 24-year-old Denna Fredericka Campbell, an officer for the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. “I was not privy to, nor do I know, what the conversation was regarding why the charges were dropped at that point in time,” McCarthy told reporters at a news conference. “While this arrest won't erase the pain of losing Denna, we hope that it brings some resolution and sense of peace to everyone involved,” Montgomery County Police Chief Marc Yamada said. Campbell said she planned to leave Ali, adding, “If I don't show up for work Saturday, you'll know he killed me and buried me somewhere,” one of those colleagues told investigators. “It was a long time coming.” MPD Executive Assistant Chief Andre Wright said Campbell had a promising career ahead of her but had already proved herself to be “a hero in the community she served." “In 1993, she selflessly pulled four victims out of a burning van on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Wright said.

Article: A judge has ordered elected officials in Georgia's Fulton County to appoint two Republican nominees they had rejected to the county’s election board ATLANTA -- A judge has ordered elected leaders in Georgia's Fulton County to appoint two Republican nominees they had rejected to the county's election board. The county Republican Party sued in June seeking to force the Board of Commissioners to appoint the party's nominees to the county Board of Registration and Elections, arguing that the commissioners were required to do so by law. Don Samuel, a lawyer representing the Board of Commissioners, said they are “disappointed in the court’s decision and are evaluating whether to appeal.” Although the board is required to appoint two people nominated by each party, he said in an email, it is not required to appoint whoever is nominated “regardless of how qualified or unqualified the nominee may be.” He added, "The BOC does not simply rubber-stamp any nominee.” Commissioner Marvin Arrington Jr., part of the Democratic majority on the board, said the judge's ruling strips commissioners of their discretion, “treating us more like record-keepers than decision-makers.” But being a county commissioner is “inherently discretionary," he said in an emailed statement, adding that commissioners “are elected to exercise judgment on behalf of our constituents.” Commissioner Bridget Thorne, a Republican, celebrated the ruling as a victory in an Instagram post. Those nominees are Jason Frazier and Julie Adams.” He wrote that the law outlines the process by which members of the election board “shall” be appointed and that he did not find anything in the law “to support a conclusion that ‘shall’ in the appointment clause is directory only.” Elections in Fulton County had a yearslong history of problems, including long lines to vote and delays in reporting results. A particularly troubled primary in 2020 resulted in the appointment of an independent monitor to observe the general election that year as part of a consent agreement between the county and the State Election Board. Another monitoring team appointed to observe last year’s general election said it was “organized and orderly.” President Donald Trump and his supporters zeroed in on Fulton County in the wake of the 2020 general election, claiming without proof that election fraud had cost him victory in Georgia.

The press release that Jean condemned states the council met with Philippe Coles, president of Caribbean Port Services, and Edouard Baussan, a wealthy businessman with strong ties to Haiti’s most powerful politicians. “It’s not a good thing at all for the country, for its political stability.” However, Jean said that some private sector members “were active operators of the chaos in which Haiti is currently engulfed.” Some of Haiti’s wealthy elites and powerful politicians have long been accused of financing and arming dozens of gangs, which the United Nations has noted in its reports.

Eight soldiers carried the casket into a grand hall at Cotroceni Palace, where it lay in state draped with Romania’s tricolor flag, as an Orthodox religious ceremony was held to mark the passing of the divisive former president. He will be buried at a cemetery in Bucharest on Thursday, which has been declared a national day of mourning in memory of the late president, and flags on official buildings shall fly at half-staff. Dominic Fritz, president of the governing coalition partner Save Romania Union party, said in a post on social media late Tuesday that his party proposed in a government meeting “that there should be no national mourning” and that USR representatives would not attend the funeral. After paying his respects next to Iliescu’s casket on Wednesday, along with other former leaders and state officials, former Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta labelled Iliescu a “truly historical personality." “With good or bad decisions, with great or heinous deeds, with people who loved him and others who hated him. “Commenting from the sidelines is always easier.” Many view Iliescu’s death as the end of an era in Romania’s modern history, a chapter in which he was a central figure in the country’s abrupt transition from communist dictatorship to free-market democracy, and later became a member of NATO and the European Union. In a statement on its official website, Romania’s Social Democratic Party, or PSD, which Iliescu founded, called it “a very sad day for Romania.” “He was a strong leader, loved by most, contested by others, as happens in democracy,” the statement read. “In the history of the last 35 years, the Ion Iliescu chapter is the most important.” In January this year, Iliescu’s legal woes mounted when prosecutors charged him with crimes against humanity in a second case. Sorin Grindeanu, the current PSD leader, said on Wednesday that his party would not attend coalition meetings “until those from USR show political maturity and review their attitude.” “We ask all politicians to show respect and decency towards the first president of democratic Romania, the one who led Romania on the European and Euro-Atlantic path,” he wrote in a post on Facebook. After President Nicusor Dan’s victory in Romania’s tense presidential rerun in May, Iliescu congratulated the new pro-Western leader in a blog post, noting that Romania “is going through a complex period” and faces economic, social, and geopolitical challenges. “I am convinced that you will exercise this responsibility with dignity and a sense of duty to the nation.” Dan described the late president on Tuesday as “the central figure of the 1990s transition” and said that “history will judge Ion Iliescu.” — Stephen McGrath reported from Leamington Spa, U.K.

Article: British regulators have criticized both sides in a dispute over a charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso FILE - Britain's Prince Harry speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative, on Sept. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, file) LONDON -- British regulators criticized on Wednesday both sides in a dispute over the future of a charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, for allowing the issue to be played out in public and damaging the organization’s reputation. The Charity Commission for England and Wales went on to say that it found no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny at Sentebale, which provides support for young people living with HIV in Botswana and Lesotho. The commission opened a review of Sentebale’s governance in April after the two princes stepped down as patrons and a group of trustees, saying the relationship between the board and its chair, Sophie Chandauka, was beyond repair. “Sentebale’s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity’s reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardizing the charity’s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve,” commission CEO David Holdsworth said in a statement released Wednesday. “The unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviors displayed in private,” she said in a statement.

Article: (Rejoice and John David Gordon via AP) A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth. It’s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home. “I felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,” said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces. However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs. “And I wanted to know the adopting parents.” The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn’t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.

New Delhi responded swiftly in a statement Wednesday, describing the U.S.' decision to raise tariffs as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," and that the country's imports are based on market factors and to ensure energy security for its population. Earlier on Monday, India's Ministry of External Affairs called out what it says is selective enforcement in a statement, adding that "it is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia." It cited data that showed the EU's trade was "significantly more" than India's total trade with Russia. His latest executive order also directs his administration to "determine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil," and the actions, if any, that need to be taken on that country.

Article: Trump's sweeping new tariffs take effect against dozens of countries Just now Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter, BBC News Reporting from Singapore Share Save Reuters US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs on more than 90 countries around the world have come into effect. Just before the deadline for deals to be agreed to cut or avoid the import taxes Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that billions of dollars were now flowing into the US due to tariffs. Last week, the Trump administration announced a revised list of import taxes on dozens of trading partners and extended a deadline for countries to reach agreements with the US to 7 August. Now you can start to analyse the impact of the tariffs." Some major economies - including the UK, Japan and South Korea - have already reached agreements to get lower tariffs than Trump threatened in April. Last week, Trump boosted the tariff rate on Canada from 25% to 35%, saying the country had "failed to cooperate" in curbing the flow of fentanyl and other drugs across the US border.

Article: New checks to stop used tyres being sent to furnaces 2 hours ago Share Save Anna Meisel BBC File on 4 Investigates Share Save Getty Images The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres every year The Environment Agency said it is introducing enhanced checks on the export of tyres from the UK after the BBC revealed millions were being sent to furnaces instead of being recycled in India. But in March of this year BBC File on 4 Investigates and Source Material, a non-profit journalism group, revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are "cooked" in order to extract carbon black – a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries – as well as the steel and oil. Pyrolysis plants can be dangerous, like this one which was the site of an explosion in January A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways in the surrounding area. "We have not been able to verify that exported waste pneumatic tyres are arriving at their intended destination sites in India," the EA said, adding that there was a "lack of sufficiently credible information" that they were being processed properly. The EA said it has an obligation to prohibit exports of waste if there is a risk that the waste will not be managed in an environmentally responsible way, and it would introduce enhanced checks on tyre exports from 1 October. The BBC tracked tyres shipped from the UK to this industrial plant in India But the pressure group Fighting Dirty, which threatened the EA with legal proceedings over what it called a "lack of action" over tyre exports, said there is "too little detail" to satisfy them that the EA's proposals will "effectively close the loopholes exploited by criminals. The group's founder Georgia Elliott-Smith said the plan "sounds promising" but just seems to be self-certification paperwork with the threat of inspections - "not much different from today's flawed protocol". The Tyre Recycling Association (TRA), which has long campaigned for a ban on exports of whole tyres, an approach adopted by the Australian government, said it was "very disappointed" the EA dismissed that idea. The EA said the new regulations are a "pragmatic solution" that will continue allow waste tyres to be exported to India, where exporters can show they are being sent somewhere with broadly equivalent standards to the UK.

Article: How Europe is vying for rare earth independence from China 8 hours ago Share Save Jonathan Josephs • jonathanjosephs Business Reporter, BBC News Reporting from La Rochelle, western France Share Save BBC Solvay's rare earths processing facility in western France is one of only two in Europe For almost 80 years rare earth metals have been pumped out of this industrial plant in La Rochelle on France's west coast. But as the materials become more and more crucial to the global economy, chemicals firm Solvay is expanding its processing plant next to the glistening Atlantic Ocean to meet surging demand across Europe. BBC / Jonathan Josephs Solvay CEO, Philippe Kehren, who is cutting the ribbon, says the facility aims to provide 30% of Europe's rare earths by 2030 There are no operational rare earth mines in Europe. "I think it's absolutely necessary to have our own mines, not necessarily a lot of them, because we can have a mix, but it's important to have our own sourcing," says Mr Kehren. However we've been granted special access to one of the separation rooms that are a vital part of the closely-guarded know-how built up since this plant started operating in 1948. "The objective of the liquid separation unit will be to purify cerium on one side, lanthanum on the other side," explains production manager Florian Gouneau as we walk up a flight of metal stairs. "It's basically like if you have a multi fruit juice with orange juice, apple juice, pineapple juice, the objective of the liquid separation unit will be to separate apple juice on one side, orange juice on the other side, and so on." The room itself is about the size of a football pitch, and home to row after row of huge metal vats within which chemical reactions force the different rare earths apart. "Having a dependency on a single source – it is dangerous because you cannot know what will happen to this source for various reasons," says Benjamin Gallezot, who is President Macron's adviser on strategic minerals and metals. "It can be a geopolitical reason, but it can also be, you know, natural disaster or whatever." In the blazing sun he won't be drawn on the impact of China trying to restrict access to its rare earths exports, a subject at the heart of continuing US China trade talks. But Mr Gallezot does say: "I think economic cooperation is clearly more powerful than just only pure competition." BBC / Tracey Langford Rare earth metals are sent to manufacturers as sacks of powder after a lengthy purification process The European Parliament wants the European Commission to do more to reduce that dependence on Chinese rare earths. On a recent visit to Germany, China's foreign minister Wang Yi said it was his country's "sovereign right", as well as being "common practice", to control exports of goods that have both commercial as well as military uses. That stance explains why securing access to raw materials has been at the heart of recent EU trade deals, such as the one it signed with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay last year.

Article: Gordon Brown calls for gambling tax to cut child poverty A spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council rejected the proposals, describing them as "economically reckless" and claiming they could push gamblers onto the black market. Brown, who was also chancellor under Tony Blair, said taxing online casinos and slot machines would be "the first crucial step in the war we must wage against child poverty". He has backed a think tank report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), saying the move could raise £3.2bn to fund scrapping the two-child limit and benefit cap. The two-child limit and benefit cap affects 1.6 million children and is blamed for rising rates of food insecurity by anti-poverty campaigners, who say getting rid of the cap is the "single most effective" step the chancellor could take to reduce child poverty. Writing in the Guardian, Brown states: "Britain is now enduring the worst levels of child poverty since modern records began, even worse than in the Thatcher-Major years, and far worse than in most European countries... "These are austerity's children, the victims of 14 years of Tory rule, an era whose most vindictive act was to treat newborn third and fourth children as second-class citizens, depriving them of all the income support available to their first and second siblings." Flagging that child poverty is set to rise to "a wholly unacceptable" 4.8 million, Brown urges Chancellor Rachel Reeves to make "a straightforward budget choice" to raise taxes on online gambling companies to fund tackling child poverty. Many online gambling firms are based offshore and pay little or no UK corporation tax, the IPPR report flags, and already benefits from unique tax advantages, including a complete exemption from VAT. Henry Parkes, principal economist and head of quantitative research at IPPR, said: "The gambling industry is highly profitable, yet is exempt from paying VAT and often pays no corporation tax, with many online firms based offshore. "Set against a context of stark and rising levels of child poverty, it only feels fair to ask this industry to contribute a little more." But a spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council said they rejected the "economically reckless, factually misleading" proposals which they insisted "risk driving huge numbers to the growing, unsafe, unregulated gambling black market, which doesn't protect consumers and contributes zero tax".

Article: Trump's broad tariffs go into effect, just as economic pain is surfacing toggle caption Noah Berger/AP WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was set to officially begin levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. After April, economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. "I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges." Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. "There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump," said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

Article: Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades Crown-of-thorns starfish are seen at Tern Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef in far North Queensland, Australia, on Jan. (Australian Institute of Marine Science via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say. But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths — caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change — have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday. The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world’s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said. Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest — and fourth ever recorded — mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world’s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. Coral reefs are considered a “unique and threatened system” due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. That report said “tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.” The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s “suggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.” “Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.

Article: imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade New US tariffs cloud outlook for exporters in Asia and beyond BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump’s new tariff rates on U.S. They are a revised version of what Trump called " reciprocal tariffs," announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan. Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on “flexible work” — the gig economy — for their livelihoods, the government estimates. India's Foreign Ministry has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, a “necessity compelled by the global market situation.” Struggling, impoverished Laos and war-torn Myanmar and Syria face 40-41% rates. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment. The slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week.

Article: Eddie Palmieri, the pioneering rumba and Latin jazz musician, has died at 88 Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. Palmieri’s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after “an extended illness.” The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle’s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums. His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album “The Sun of Latin Music,” and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams. In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: “Learning to play the piano well. Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of “Harlem River Drive,” in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production “Llegó La India vía Eddie Palmieri.” Palmieri released the album “Masterpiece” in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year.

Article: The extra duties — set to come into effect within 21 days — will be stacked on top of the 25% tariffs on New Delhi due Thursday stateside, according to the executive order. Its total goods' exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data. The resulting drop in exports due to tariffs would mean the economy grows by closer to 6% this year and next, rather than the 7% growth forecast prior to Trump's announcement, Shah said. With notable variance across industries and little clarity over Trump's plans with sector-specific tariffs, here are segments that potentially stand to lose the most: Engineering goods Engineering goods, including products like auto parts, power equipment and industrial machinery, have been India's biggest of exports to the U.S. Rajesh Mehta, executive chairman of Indian jewelry maker Rajesh Exports, said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday that higher tariffs will be an "additional burden," while calling for government support for the sector . "Without a doubt, the new tariff rate is going to seriously test the resolve and resilience of India's textile and apparel exporters as we will not enjoy a significant duty differential advantage vis-à-vis many other countries, except Bangladesh, with whom we compete for a larger share of the US market," the Confederation of Indian textile industry said in a statement dated July 30 , before the latest hike in duties was announced. for 38% of its exports last fiscal year, making it "the most exposed" to potential risks of the tariff exemptions being rolled back, according to Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. In an interview to CNBC Trump said he would initially impose a "small tariff" on pharma, and then raise that rate to as high as 250% in a few years. "[India's] Chemicals overall have somewhat less US exposure but this masks the high pharmaceutical sector's US dependency therein," said Hermann, leaving the pharma sector highly vulnerable to Trump's potential tariffs. India competes against the likes of Europe in pharmaceuticals; Vietnam and Mexico in electronics; Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam in textiles; and Israel in gems and jewelry, according to Wan. In his latest tariff adjustment, Trump also eased tariffs on Thailand to 19% from the "reciprocal" tariff level of 36%, Bangladesh to 20% from 35% and Cambodia to 19% from 36%.

Article: Apple and Alphabet 's Google are often seen as the potential big players in a world where people interact with advanced AI assistant on their phones and other devices — especially as the technology gets more personalized. "It's a battle right now in Big Tech to be the UI (user interface) for AI, and Meta actually has an extraordinary distribution advantage here, because they're in the pocket of 3.48 billion users," Pleydell-Bouverie told CNBC in an interview this week. So far, Meta's AI efforts have focused on using the technology to improve the way it serves ads to users and to boost engagement across its apps like Facebook and Instagram. "We all know that proprietary data is one of the most important assets to own when it comes to creating an AI product or service, but not all data assets are created equal. "The key is that Meta's platforms are increasingly where personal real-time data is stored and gets transacted." This is where Meta has a key advantage to deliver more "personalized AI," Pleydell-Bouverie said. AI and the smartphone One challenge facing Meta is to what extent it can stand out from the crowd in a world of established operating systems which are run by other big tech companies. "The problem Meta has is it does not own a platform like Microsoft or Apple does – it is a collection of apps that are hosted on others' operating systems. As such, it is far easier for Google, Apple and Microsoft to push its AI tools to users in a way that Meta simply can't," Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email. Another prevailing view is that as AI becomes more personal, it will learn from people's habits on their devices, including how users interact with apps on their smartphone and other usage patterns. This means that you need to understand the individual's data information and tailor the AI to that," Ian Fogg, tech industry analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC in an interview. "If you're on a device as part of an operating system, which is what Gemini is or whatever Apple does, you have a clear advantage there." Investors have grown increasingly concerned with Apple's lack of AI strategy and the move of its former design chief Jony Ive to OpenAI, which is working on devices that could rival the iPhone giant. This may go some way to explain why Facebook rebranded as Meta in 2021 with a focus on the so-called "metaverse," a digital world where avatars socialize, play and shop together. "This is partly why Zuckerberg wants to develop the Metaverse, so that the company has that platform where its own products are in front of its customers, rather than having to be found," Barringer said.

Article: President Donald Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States." Details on how much domestic manufacturing is required to qualify for the exemption remain unclear. However, South Korean chip majors Samsung and SK Hynix appeared to be exempted from the 100% tariffs, the country's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo was reported as saying on the radio. "We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors," Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that companies like Apple that are building or committed to building in the U.S. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, noted that "the devil is in the details" as there is no clear framework yet on how exactly the chip tariffs are going to work. While Japanese semiconductor process equipment markets may wobble at the start given the headline shock of "100% tariffs," the move could be positive for the industry given the number of Japanese chipmaking equipment that are indispensable for most chipmakers looking to ramp up U.S. As of this moment, the big companies are the "clear winners," said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, citing companies like Apple, Nvidia and TSMC as the ones with the "most dollars to pledge." "These are the big wins that President Trump wants to get," Newman said, adding that the smaller companies that do not have the same scale and leverage will have to negotiate.

Article: toggle caption Andrew Max Levy/Dropout For years after it was invented in the 1970s , Dungeons & Dragons remained a niche game that people – stereotypically, nerdy boys – played at home with their friends. Roughly 20,000 fans showed up to watch seven comedians perform D&D, with a few rock show flourishes – like gouts of butane fire around the stage to simulate the wrath of the dragon Kalvaxis, the big villain of the night. Many parents were wary of D&D after it was swept up in the "Satanic Panic" of the '80s and '90s, when anti-occult campaigns like "Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons" alleged it drew kids to devil worship and suicide. "I was hiding under picnic tables at recess reading animal fact cards." Lee enrolled Mulligan in karate and found a group of college kids who agreed to teach him D&D. The stories they tell are mashups: Game of Thrones meets Candyland , Lord of the Rings meets The Breakfast Club , Jane Austen meets A Court of Thorns and Roses . Sponsor Message The rise of actual play Fans of D&D started recording their games in the early 2000s , but actual play didn't pick up as a genre until around a decade later. toggle caption Anna Webber/Getty Images North America As of 2021, there were hundreds of actual play podcasts and web shows like these, Stephanie Hedge at University of Illinois Springfield wrote in Roleplaying Games in the Digital Age . "That sounds fun for me," Wilson remembers thinking, but "I don't know who [else] that will be fun for." toggle caption Andrew Max Levy/Dropout Once the cast of Dimension 20 started actually making the first season, though, that changed: "Watching how brilliant as writers and actors the other people at the table were," Wilson said, "that's when it finally hit me… Oh, this is something that people would like to watch." The people who make actual play shows – and those who watch or listen to them – have different answers to explain why the performances are so popular. At a recent Dimension 20 live show at Seattle's Climate Pledge Arena – seating capacity 18,000 – Emily Lopez came dressed as Wilson's character Fabian Seacaster, complete with an eyepatch, scar, and a crab-festooned crown. Oh my gosh, there's several people of color, and there's women in this group, and also, they're all hilarious.'" toggle caption Juan Pablo Chiquiza/KUOW This reflects a broader trend in D&D – for the first time in D&D's long history, as many women play as men, according to D&D executive producer Greg Bilsland. And I think that was the point where I realized actual play could do more than just sort of be niche entertainment." Suz Portillo, another attendee at the Seattle show, said what drew her to watching actual play is the same thing that drew her to play D&D: it lets her return to her childhood, playing pretend with her friends. "D&D gives people a platform to do that again as adults in a way that it's like, 'Oh, it's okay to be silly and have fun and continue to story-tell and fantasize and dream and create.'" toggle caption Juan Pablo Chiquiza/KUOW Brennan Lee Mulligan also thinks the popularity has to do with the hanging-out-with-friends feel of these shows. "And it has all the best parts of both, because while you are getting engrossed in the fate of the galaxy, while you are shocked and devastated at the sudden betrayal of the Archduke of some faraway fantasy land, you are also here with your friends, and it's their relationships and their patterns that you know and love, just like with everyone's favorite podcasts and their favorite streams." "This is the age of Dungeons & Dragons" As more people watch D&D for entertainment, more people seem to be playing it too. Though an exact number of players is hard to track, Bilsland said something like 85 million people have engaged with the game, associated video games, and the movie Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves over the past few years. "It's widely agreed that [the most recent edition] is the most successful edition of D&D ever, and that is largely accounted for from the success of streaming and live play," Bilsland said. That newest edition of the game emphasizes fun over following the rules to a T, and actual play is a great demonstration of how that looks at a game night, said Justice Arman, managing game designer of Dungeons & Dragons. "They often need the rules less, because they have that chemistry and are very funny and good actors." And Mulligan says that the number one question Dimension 20 gets from fans isn't about their show – it's "How do I start a D&D group?" "I don't think Renaissance is an appropriate word anymore, because we're not even, like harkening back [to a Golden Age].

Article: Trump cuts threaten access to birth control for millions of women toggle caption Liudmila Chernetska/iStockphoto/Getty Images Contraception is a routine part of life for many Americans and polls show people across political parties agree that it should be legal and accessible. But the Trump administration is walking back access to birth control for some people — including withholding funding from a Nixon-era program that guarantees access to contraception for low income people. In a special message to Congress in July 1969, Nixon wrote: "It is my view that no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance, because of her economic condition." The program has existed ever since. Now, a group of 15 public health organizations is suing the Trump administration, arguing that the federal government jeopardized access to services including birth control for more than 800,000 people due to illegal withholding of Title X dollars. Stephanie McDowell, Bridgercare's executive director, recalls receiving a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services on March 31st, notifying her that her organization's funding would be suspended the next day. A message on the organization's website underscores that they welcome patients of different identities, including "teens, LGBTQ+ individuals, and survivors of sexual assault." Sponsor Message McDowell says she believes these kinds of statements are what HHS is referring to. " We meet people where they are, and that oftentimes means letting people know that we're a safe, welcoming space for them, regardless of their income, regardless of their identity," says McDowell. In Utah, Planned Parenthood representatives said they've had to close two clinics as a result of Title X funds being withheld, as well as implement a fee for some contraception services that were previously free. "We are not able to count on the federal government to keep the promise it made to access low cost care and to plan and space their families." The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which is representing the organizations that brought the Title X lawsuit against the government, note that some grant recipients have received notice that their Title X funding will be restored. She points to cuts to Medicaid included in the Republican spending bill that was recently signed into law, which jeopardize access to healthcare — including contraception — for millions of women in coming years. In Indiana, Republican lawmakers removed IUDs and condoms from a program that aimed to increase access to birth control, replacing them with "fertility awareness based methods." After a Right to Contraception bill passed with bipartisan support in Virginia, Republican Governor Youngkin vetoed it. That provision is currently blocked in court, though Planned Parenthood officials say they are preparing for an appeal and underscore that 200 clinics across 24 states are at risk of closure. "They are intent on expanding the population" Neither the Trump administration nor the Heritage Foundation responded to a request for comment on this story or explained why they seek to reduce access to contraception. "All of this is building a structure that makes it harder and harder for individuals to control their sexual and reproductive lives, to plan their families and have kids when they want to." Kimi Chernoby, with the National Women's Law Center, draws parallels between the administration's effort to limit contraception with successful efforts to limit abortion.

Article: DHS took 5 days to fund Texas flooding hotline, federal records show toggle caption Jim Vondruska/Getty Images/Getty Images North America In the week after floods tore through Texas Hill Country, most survivors were unable to get through to a federal aid hotline because the Department of Homeland Security let funding lapse, according to publicly available contract records and internal FEMA call center logs obtained by NPR. The next day, FEMA staff filed contract-related paperwork with DHS that stated that the funding had lapsed, according to publicly available contract records and internal FEMA records obtained by NPR. On July 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th FEMA answered just over 15,000 of the approximately 55,000 calls that came in from disaster survivors, according to the internal FEMA logs obtained by NPR. Sponsor Message In comparison, after Hurricane Helene caused widespread devastation in the Southeast last year FEMA call centers answered about 50% to 70% of calls from survivors, according to call center logs released by the agency . Michael Coen, who served as FEMA chief of staff during the Obama and Biden administrations, said he couldn't recall ever seeing such a lapse in funding in his time at the agency. On July 10th, five days after the call center funding lapsed, FEMA's acting administrator, David Richardson, sent a memo to Secretary Noem asking her to approve funding for at least one call center vendor. That memo, obtained by NPR, lays out the dire effects of the delay, noting that survivors were waiting "over 90 minutes" to get through to FEMA, and that "The call center service level has gone from 99.9% of calls answered prior to hang up to 20% of calls answered." Late that same day, on July 10th, the funding was approved for all the vendors, and call centers were staffed adequately once again, according to contract reports and call center logs. In response to questions from NPR about why funding lapsed for FEMA call centers, and the resulting failure to answer calls from survivors, a FEMA spokesperson wrote in a statement to NPR, "When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times can subsequently increase. Despite this expected influx, FEMA's disaster call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one was left without assistance." The call center logs and Richardson's memo directly contradict this statement. In a post on the social media site X , Lesley Briones, a county commissioner in Harris County, TX, wrote, "The vital agency is understaffed and under-resourced, creating a dangerous situation for communities vulnerable to disasters." The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions from NPR. Meredith Matthews, a spokesperson for another vendor called TTEC, wrote in an email to NPR that she could not "share specific contractual or operational details," and that "TTEC has a long-standing history of supporting FEMA's mission to assist disaster survivors, and we're proud to be part of those efforts—especially during times of urgent need like the recent Texas floods." The last vendor did not respond to questions from NPR. Internal FEMA documents contradict testimony about how many calls were answered During testimony before a House subcommittee on July 23rd, Richardson was asked about the agency's staffing of call centers. Laura Friedman (D-CA) asked the FEMA leader about the report in The New York Times that showed FEMA call centers had been inadequately staffed in the week after the Texas floods. "They either answered the calls or they didn't answer the calls on July 7th." "When there was a spike in calls, FEMA was there to answer the calls," Richardson said. "The majority of the calls were answered at the call centers." Richardson went on to say, twice, that "there was never a lapse in contract." Richardson was "splitting hairs," says Christopher Byrne, who worked as a senior contracting officer at the U.S. That memo, which was signed by Richardson, acknowledges that most calls were not being answered at that time, and says "The contract was placed on hold on July 5, 2025, and is needed immediately to support the disaster response in Texas." The call center funding is set to lapse again on Friday, August 8 FEMA has the option to renew funding for call center staff every 30 days, contract records show. Sponsor Message The reason that the funding expires every 30 days is that the number of calls the agency receives from Americans seeking help after disasters fluctuates throughout the year.

Article: Gratz for The Washington Post/Getty Images Representative Mike Flood felt the full fury of his constituents over his support of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" at a town hall meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska this week. Flood — a second-term Republican — hosted the public gathering Monday night where attendees loudly berated him about concerns that social safety net programs, namely Medicaid, would be affected by the president's signature piece of legislation. Attendees from the crowd of more than 700 also questioned the president's controversial approach to immigration enforcement and repeatedly heckled Flood as he tried to defend the tax and spending measure. At one point many in the audience chanted "Tax the rich!" The town hall, which has gone viral, wrapped up with chants of "Vote him out!" In an interview with Morning Edition, Flood said "it's important to stand in the town square and explain your votes and what it means to dispel misinformation and take questions," noting that the "most spirited" attendees are regulars at his town halls and residents of the city. "If you're able bodied, you can work and you choose not to work, then you will not get free health care," Flood said, referring to the added Medicaid work requirements in states that have expanded the safety net program. Interview highlights Steve Inskeep: You talked preemptively, as a matter of fact, about Medicaid cuts, which are part of the big budget bill that President Trump signed recently and that you voted for. You know, health care for all is different in California than a medicaid program in Nebraska, where we are, in my opinion, miles ahead in terms of our error rates and the way we process this. There are those of us in Congress that are working to make sure our government runs efficiently and we're not out waving a flag, trying to call attention to ourselves. Sponsor Message Flood: Well, the greatest Christmas gift we could have in this country is to have our trade partnerships and our trade policies and everything wrapped up by Christmas time.

Article: Here's why toggle caption Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images NFL players will no longer be able to use smelling salts to get a quick jolt of alertness on the field. The league cited a warning from the FDA released last year, informing consumers that smelling salts — often marketed to increase alertness and energy — have not been proven to be safe or effective for that purpose. Sponsor Message San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle first revealed the ban in an interview with NFL Network on Tuesday, noting he was "distraught" by the announcement because he uses smelling salts multiple times throughout a game, and wanted to "figure out a middle ground" with the league. When dried, the substance looks like table salt and was initially called the salt of hartshorn — named for the horns of male deer from which it was commonly derived in the 17th century. "I think some people describe it as being like you're really close up to cat urine." When inhaled, the ammonia gas activates receptors in the nose, which lead to a cascade of reactions that cause an increase in respiratory rate, cerebral blood flow and heart rate. From the medicine cabinet to the field But this physiological reaction has also been sought after by some athletes because it leads to a "subjective increase in perceived alertness and 'psyched-up energy,'" according to a recent paper about smelling salts. "What's happening with some athletes is they're using them with much higher frequency than its intended use." Sponsor Message Smelling salts are widely available and can be purchased over the counter. "They are very famous for doing rituals like wearing a lucky shirt or wearing a certain hairdo." Despite the perceived effects of smelling salts, there is no strong evidence to support the theory that smelling salts enhance athletic performance. Why sniffing for a boost could backfire Though smelling salts are medically indicated at times, inappropriate and frequent use of the substance can lead to adverse events like shortness of breath, seizures and migraines. "Whenever you're using a tool outside of its recommended use, you're in kind of uncharted territory," Boxley said, noting that if players are willing to take that risk, the payoff should be worth it.

Article: In 1944, as World War II raged, Allied representatives gathered at a picturesque New Hampshire resort named Bretton Woods to discuss how to establish a postwar economic order to restore the sensible flow of trade in a fractured world. Our current, nameless global order, which is dominated by the World Trade Organization and is notionally designed to pursue economic efficiency and regulate the trade policies of its 166 member countries, is untenable and unsustainable. The United States has paid for the system with the loss of industrial jobs and economic security, other countries have been unable to make needed reforms, and the biggest winner has been China, with its state-owned enterprises and five-year plans. Last week at his Turnberry resort on the Scottish coast, President Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, concluded a historic agreement — one that is fair, balanced and oriented toward serving concrete national interests rather than vague aspirations of multilateral institutions. At the same time, other countries kept their markets closed to our goods and deployed a suite of policies — such as subsidies, wage suppression, lax labor and environmental standards, regulatory distortions and currency manipulation — to artificially boost exports to the United States.

The meeting would be the first between a sitting US and Russian president since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021, and comes as Trump seeks to broker an end to Russia's military assault on Ukraine. Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov said that a “meeting between Putin and Trump (will take place) in the coming days,” adding that “work on the summit has now begun.” Ushakov said that White House special envoy Steve Witkoff had raised the idea of a trilateral meeting between Putin, Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but that the upcoming meeting would only be between Trump and Putin. “The venue of the meeting between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, has been agreed, and the Kremlin will inform about it later,” Ushakov said.

"At the suggestion of the American side, an agreement in principle was made to hold a bilateral meeting at the highest level in the coming days," Putin's longtime foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov, told state media. In recent weeks, the American leader has adopted far tougher language than his historical warmth toward his Russian opposite number — decrying Russia's continued bombing of Ukrainian civilians and pledging arms sales to Ukraine via Europe. He said this idea "for some reason was mentioned by Washington yesterday" but "not specifically discussed," and the Russian side had "left this option completely, completely without comment."

The BBC decided to still show this year's amateur series - filmed before they were sacked - saying it was "the right thing to do" for the chefs who took part. But it faced a backlash from some women who came forward, as well as from the broadcast union Bectu who said showing the episodes could be “triggering” for people who had had complaints upheld. MasterChef returns with sacked hosts but without their jokes The first three episodes were released on iPlayer on Wednesday morning, with the series opener broadcast on BBC One at 20:00 BST. 'They have edited out the jokes' Ahead of the new series airing, there had been speculation that the new episodes might be re-edited to reduce the presence of Wallace and Torode. In a review, The Telegraph's critic Ed Cumming wrote: "To show how seriously the BBC takes the allegations against the presenters, they have edited out their jokes." The resulting series "lacks pizzazz", he said. The Standard's Vicky Jessop wrote: "No jokes here – the production team presumably being terrified that anything either of them says would be taken the wrong way."

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said as a viewer, she "certainly won't be watching it", but that it wasn't her place to tell broadcasters what they could or couldn't show. Meanwhile, former Celebrity MasterChef contestant Kirsty Wark - who first came forward to BBC News with claims against Wallace - suggested the BBC could have refilmed the series without the two co-hosts.

"I don't believe we have an obligation to sustain the bureaucracy." toggle caption Tony Leys/KFF Health News A 400-mile drive to a VA hospital About 9 million veterans are enrolled in the VA health system. Last year, about 3 million of them — including 1.2 million rural veterans — used their benefits to cover care at non-VA facilities, according to data provided by the department.

Article: The decision is the latest in a series of moves by President Trump’s administration to restore Confederate names and symbols that had been discarded as part of the nation’s racial reconciliation efforts following George Floyd’s murder in 2020. “I’m proud to announce that Moses Ezekiel’s beautiful and historic sculpture — often referred to as “The Reconciliation Monument” — will be rightfully be returned to Arlington National Cemetery near his burial site,” Hegseth posted on X, referring to the memorial’s creator. Unlike the Left, we don’t believe in erasing American history — we honor it.” The 32-foot bronze statue commissioned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy was unveiled at a ceremony presided over by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914, almost 50 years after the Civil War ended. But critics said the memorial glorified the Southern cause and glossed over slavery, with elements such as a frieze showing an enslaved Black man following his owner and an enslaved woman — described on the cemetery’s website as a “mammy” — holding the baby of a Confederate officer. Advertisement “We are grateful for the care being taken to preserve and display this statue, which allows us to better understand the complex history of the United States,” he said. Hegseth’s announcement that the Confederate memorial would return to Arlington came a day after the National Park Service said a statue of Confederate brigadier general Albert Pike, torn down and set on fire by protesters in 2020, would return to its original site in Washington D.C. In March, Trump issued an executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” that included a section saying the administration would “determine whether, since January 1, 2020, public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.” It said it would take action to reinstate those monuments, memorials and statues. Advertisement The Confederate Memorial’s removal from Arlington was ordered by the bipartisan Naming Commission, which was established by Congress in 2021 and prompted in part by the calls for racial justice following George Floyd’s murder. “This is not some woke thing, it’s the will of the American people that Secretary Hegseth is going against.” The monument, Seidule said, “is the cruelest I’ve ever seen because it’s a pro-slavery, pro-segregation, anti-United States monument. It’s a Confederate monument and it’s meant to say that the white South was right and the United States of America was wrong.” In its decision recommending the Confederate Memorial at Arlington for removal, the commission cited imagery on the memorial and an accompanying Latin phrase celebrating the Lost Cause retelling of the Confederacy. Advertisement “This narrative of the Lost Cause, which romanticized the pre-Civil War South and denied the horrors of slavery, fueled White backlash against Reconstruction and the rights that the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments (1865-1870) had granted to African Americans,” the commission wrote. “This was a memorial to men who committed treason in defense of the supposed right of some humans to ‘own’ other humans as property,” James Grossman, former executive director of the American Historical Association, told The Washington Post on the day the sculpture was removed from Arlington National Cemetery. “The very idea that this monument was still here until today reminds us not just how far we’ve come but how much further we have to go.” In addition to recommending the removal of the Confederate memorial, the naming commission also identified nine army bases for name changes, including Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Pickett in Virginia, Fort Benning in Georgia and Fort Hood in Texas.

Article: US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 13, 2025. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India's largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, described the penalty for Russian oil purchases as "economic blackmail" by Trump, further reducing the political room for Modi to concede to American demands.

The Indian rupee will be the immediate casualty, according to Mahesh Patil, who oversees more than 3 lakh crore rupees ($35 billion) worth of financial assets at the Mumbai-based Aditya Birla Mutual Fund as its chief investment officer.

Article: Courtesy: Kylie Ruprecht "People view medical students as future rich people and that's not the case at all," said Kylie Ruprecht, a third-year student at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine. "You go into crazy, crazy debt to go into medicine," said Ruprecht, 24, "and then repay those loans over decades." Ruprecht relies on a combination of unsubsidized student loans and Grad PLUS loans to cover her costs. In fact, about 27.5% of medical school students and 60% of those in dentistry programs graduated with more debt in 2020 than is allowed under the new loan limits, according to calculations by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. "Medical school is the 'hair on fire' situation because the numbers are big, period, and the gaps between the federal loan limits and the program costs are sizeable," said Ken Ruggiero, co-founder and CEO of private education lender Ascent Funding. A growing shortage of doctors The new legislation "doesn't affect everyone equally," Mukkamala said — it's students from underserved communities who will be less likely to go into the medical field as the new loan limits fall short of the total cost of attendance, which is over $200,000. "The new annual and aggregate loan limits could create challenges for some medical students to finance their education, resulting in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school and ultimately worsening the current and projected physician shortage," said Kristen Earle, program leader for student financial aid services at the Association of American Medical Colleges. "The changing landscape does present an opportunity for private lenders." Private student loans often come into play once students have reached the federal loan limits and still need additional education financing.

Article: Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving way for its entrance into the market. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss "a significant and clinically meaningful outcome." "Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies," he continued. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at the Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill "has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects." The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with plans to launch the pill in 2026, Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in an interview. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacturer pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in.

Article: UK says British Steel's Chinese owners demanding millions 15 minutes ago Share Save Jack Fenwick Political reporter Share Save Getty Images Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is set for a showdown with the Chinese owners of British Steel after the government claimed they demanded hundreds of millions in taxpayer money for the steelworks at Scunthorpe. A senior source in the Department for Business and Trade would not rule out handing over some public money to the Chinese firm, but said the two sides' valuations of British Steel were still very different. A spokesperson for the business department said they "acted quickly to ensure the continued operation of the blast furnaces and are working with Jingye to determine the best long-term sustainable future for the site". In April, MPs and peers were called back from their Easter holidays to pass legislation that allowed the government to take control of British Steel, during an extremely rare Saturday sitting of Parliament. Reynolds said at the time that full nationalisation was the likely next step, but ministers had been hoping that Jingye would hand over ownership of the company for a nominal fee. That was thrown into doubt during negotiations between the two sides earlier this summer, when Jingye told government officials they believed British Steel's valuation was still in the hundreds of millions. Getty Images Jonathan Reynolds took control of the Scunthorpe works in April Jingye claimed the Scunthorpe plant was losing £700,000 a day when it announced plans to close the site in March. But ministers do not see public ownership as a long-term solution and have repeatedly said they are confident they will find another commercial partner to take on the ownership of British Steel. They said the government was "closer to the beginning than the end" of talks with Jingye, but said they were confident of getting the Chinese firm to accept "a more realistic valuation". Another source close to the negotiations cast doubt on Jingye's willingness to budge and said they believed the government would "need to step in and take ownership of the business" through another Parliamentary process. Using Parliament to force through a full nationalisation is understood to be a "last resort" in ministers' minds, because of concerns about the sort of message it could send to the wider business community.

Article: Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir, accusing them of promoting a "false narrative" and "secessionism." SRINAGAR, India -- Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir that they say propagate “false narratives” and “secessionism” in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019. It said such books played “a critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.” The action was taken following “investigations and credible intelligence” about “systemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature” that was “often disguised as historical or political commentary,” it said. A year earlier to that, police arrested a college lecturer on charges he gave his students an English exam filled with questions attacking a crackdown on demonstrations challenging Indian rule in the region. “It only exposes the insecurities and limited understanding of those behind such authoritarian actions, and the contradiction in proudly hosting the ongoing Book Festival.” Banning books is not common in India, but authorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have increasingly raided independent media houses, jailed journalists and sought to re-write history in school and university textbooks to promote the Hindu nationalist vision of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

The blaze, which started Tuesday and tore through the Corbières massif in the Aude region, has remained uncontained despite the deployment of over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft. “It’s very sad to think about the image we’re going to give of our Corbières region, with its devastated landscapes and desperate women and men, not just today or tomorrow, but for weeks and months to come. “It is a fire that is clearly a consequence of climate change and drought in this region.” This week’s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.

When Duggan responded to Musk on X saying “Now you've got my attention,” the Michigan Democratic Party said the mayor was “cozying” up to the richest man in the world.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican plan for congressional redistricting are pleading for donations to help cover their costs After leaving Texas for Illinois to prevent a legislative vote on a Republican redistricting plan, state House Democratic leader Gene Wu needed a means to project his voice — and viewpoints — to a national audience. Now Texas Democrats are pleading for donations to help finance what could be a walkout of weeks — if not months — in a high-stakes attempt to prevent the Republican majority from passing a plan sought by President Donald Trump. “We’re getting a lot of small-dollar donations,” Wu told The Associated Press, "and that’s going to be used to help keep this thing going.” A political group led by Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, gave money to the Texas House Democratic Caucus to help cover the up-front costs, according to a spokesperson for the group, Powered by People. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said Wednesday he's launching an investigation into whether O'Rourke's group has committed bribery by a “financial influence scheme” benefiting Democrats who left Texas. Not only could Texas Democrats face thousands of dollars in out-of-state lodging and dining costs, they also could eventually face fines of $500 for each day they are absent, which under House rules cannot be paid from their office budgets or political contributions. Jose Menendez joined Democrats from other states at a rally in Boston, where he noted that the potential daily fine for quorum-breaking lawmakers is nearly as large as their entire monthly legislative salary. Some Democrats in the Texas Senate have traveled out of state this week to support their House colleagues, but lawmakers in that chamber are not leaving the state to hold up legislative business. We don’t have billionaires who are funding this operation.” The House Democratic Caucus has set up a website seeking donations of between $25 and $2,500 — with a default amount of $250. Earlier this week, Abbott asked the state's highest court to remove Wu from office and ordered the Texas Rangers to investigate possible bribery charges related to how Democrats are paying for the walkout, alleging anyone who financially helped them could be culpable. Before Democrats decided to leave Texas, Wu said he called potential allies for assurance “that there would be resources that would come to our assistance.” But he said that's no different from an aspiring candidate asking others for support before officially launching a campaign. Texas Democrats aren’t worried that they'll be forced to return home in the near future because of a lack of money, said Luke Warford, founder of Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund, a Texas fundraising and organizing group. But "when you think about it in the context of what Donald Trump has to gain and what Democrats might lose in the short term, it’s just not even close to the cost of trying to win back either these races or a bunch of other races in the country.” The Democratic lawmakers have been holed up at a hotel and conference center outside Chicago that was evacuated Wednesday after an unfounded bomb threat. "Our hotel bills seem so minor compared to what we’re trying to do — to protect democracy.” ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report.

Article: As President Donald Trump pressures Republican states to reopen the process of redistricting mid cycle, Vice President JD Vance is set to meet with GOP leaders in Indiana FILE - U.S. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) Vice President JD Vance visits Indiana on Thursday to discuss redistricting with Republican leaders as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on GOP states to redraw congressional boundaries and give the party more winnable seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Vance's visit comes after Texas Democrats successfully stalled a vote there this week on a redrawn congressional map, part of a bid to secure five more GOP-leaning congressional seats at the expense of Democrats before the midterms. Indiana is staunchly Republican, but opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. But Indiana is also home to Mike Pence, the former vice president and a past governor whose more measured approach to partisan politics still holds sway among many state lawmakers. Frank Mrvan has been seen as a possible pickup in recent years as manufacturing union jobs have left the area, said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes that also gave a boost to the GOP in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. In a statement Tuesday, Mrvan said the Trump administration knows its policies are “wildly unpopular.” “They know that their only hope to maintain control is to pressure the Indiana General Assembly to violate the Indiana Constitution and redistrict U.S. Julia Vaughn, director of Common Cause Indiana, said a costly redistricting process will not look good for Republicans who tightened the belt on the state budget this past legislative session due to revenue forecasts. “I don’t think there is any way they could rationalize spending taxpayer dollars to come back to Indianapolis to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago for purely partisan purposes,” Vaughn said.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

Article: Germans worry that their beloved kebab in a pita sandwich may get more expensive Germans worry their beloved kebab may get more pricy or even scarce because of factory strike BERLIN -- Germans are in kebab angst. For weeks, workers at the Birtat Meat World SE factory in southwestern Germany have repeatedly stopped the production line by walking off their jobs in "warning strikes,” demanding wage increases of 375 euros ($434) per month. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union that represents them says that payment methods are nontransparent and workers are making vastly different salaries for the same kind of job, according to German news agency dpa. Germans already complain that the meaty snack, which used to be a cheap staple that sold for 2.50 euros about two decades ago, has become too expensive, with most places charging at least 7 euros ($8) or more. Halil Duman was pondering the state of the kebab business as he was busy slicing off thin pieces of ground beef at Pergamon Döner, a small eatery at Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse train station where people were lining up for lunch. "The produce is becoming more expensive and we barely make profit anymore.” “But if we raise the prices any further, people won't buy here anymore,” said Duman, who has been working at kebab stores in the German capital for more than 30 years and was selling the classic kebab sandwich for 7.50 euros (around $8.70). The word comes from the Turkish verb “donmek,” meaning to turn — the meat is grilled for hours on a spit and cut off in razor-thin slices when it's crisp and brown. First brought to Berlin by Turkish immigrants in the 1970s, the grilled meat snack, which comes wrapped in pita bread with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions and different dressings, is now sold everywhere in Germany, from regions stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Bavarian Alps. According to legend, it was Mahmut Aygun, a Turkish guest worker, who invented the first döner sandwich in 1971, when he sold the meat in a piece of pita bread with yogurt dressing at a stand close to a main train station next to the zoo in West Berlin. About 2.9 million people with Turkish roots live in Germany — but the döner kebab sandwich has become so ubiquitous in the country that many foreign tourists consider it typically German and don't even know about the snack's immigrant past.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. When a friend asked what she was planning for Thursday, she wrote: “on Thursday we kill all the Mexico’s.” Mathis said the comments were “wrong” and “stupid,” but context showed they were not a threat. “And it was this stupid, stupid technology that is just going through picking up random words and not looking at context.” Surveillance systems in American schools increasingly monitor everything students write on school accounts and devices. The 13-year-old girl arrested in August 2023 had been texting with friends on a chat function tied to her school email at Fairview Middle School, which uses Gaggle to monitor students' accounts. The school district did not respond to a request for comment.) Taken to jail, the teen was interrogated and strip-searched, and her parents weren't allowed to talk to her until the next day, according to a lawsuit they filed against the school system. Amy Bennett, chief of staff for Lightspeed Systems, said that the software helps understaffed schools “be proactive rather than punitive” by identifying early warning signs of bullying, self-harm, violence or abuse. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others. “A really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience — not something that helps them with their mental health care,” said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues — including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students’ Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. Natasha Torkzaban, who graduated in 2024, said she was flagged for editing a friend’s college essay because it had the words “mental health.” “I think ideally we wouldn’t stick a new and shiny solution of AI on a deep-rooted issue of teenage mental health and the suicide rates in America, but that’s where we’re at right now,” Torkzaban said. She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.

Also on Thursday, Eli Lilly released long-awaited late-stage trial data on its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, the highest dose of which helped patients lose more than 12% of their body weight. Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $6.31 adjusted vs. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 46% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. The move came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S.

Article: In fiscal year 2026, which began in July, the company plans to reduce run-rate expenses by another $100 million, on top of the $200 million it cut in fiscal 2025. "We are launching a cost restructuring plan intended to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of FY26 by reducing the size of our global team, paring back indirect spend, and relocating some of our work. This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business." The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff. Here's how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 5 cents vs. $580 million expected The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. During the most recent quarter, Peloton sold more bikes and treadmills than Wall Street expected, posting connected fitness revenue of $198.6 million, well ahead of the $170.3 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Improving top-line metrics, which allows Peloton to better leverage its fixed costs, led to a 5.6 percentage point increase to its gross margin, which was 54.1% during the quarter, compared to 48.5% in the year ago period. Now that cash flow and some metrics are starting to stabilize, Stern is ready to talk about growth and outlined his vision to get there in his letter to shareholders. To offset the high costs of acquiring customers online, Peloton is returning to physical retail but this time, it'll open up micro-stores, rather than the sprawling showrooms it had in its early days. It also plans to increase the presence of its instructors at in-person events by three times this year, with the goal of increasing it by 10 times in fiscal 2027, he added. Stern said the company will also work more closely with Precor, the fitness company it acquired under founder John Foley, by creating a "unified commercial business unit." He also said the company will start building a plan to expand internationally – a goal that Peloton has long had but has failed to execute profitably.

Article: The BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at its latest monetary policy meeting, but traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the decision among the bank's policymakers. As it turned out on Thursday, the nine-member MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the key interest rate, the "Bank Rate," by 25 basis points rather than keeping it on hold. Policy makers have had to weigh up sticky inflation — the consumer price index (CPI) rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — with a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth. In a statement Thursday, the bank said the MPC "remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term." Despite the divergent views of policymakers at the BOE, economists expect the downward trajectory for interest rates to continue into next year, but the central bank reiterated its cautious approach, noting that "a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate." The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy will depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures continue to ease, the BOE said. economist at Barclays, said ahead of the latest policy meeting that he expected the BOE to continue with gradual, quarterly 25-basis-point cuts until the Bank Rate, its key interest rate, reaches 3.5% in February next year. "Despite the unexpected rise in CPI inflation in June, we still think the weakness in the labour market means it's only a matter of time before wage growth and inflation slow to rates consistent with the 2% inflation target. We think the Bank of England will cut interest rates from 4.25% now to 3.00% in 2026, which would take rates below the low of 3.50% priced into the financial markets," he said in a note Wednesday.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File) LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate Thursday by a quarter percentage point to 4%, as policy makers seek to bolster the sluggish U.K. “There will be hopes that if loans become cheaper, it will help boost consumer and business confidence but there’s a long way to go,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said before the decision. “In the meantime, speculation over potential tax rises in the Autumn Budget may keep households and companies cautious, given the uncertainty over where extra burdens may land.” Policymakers decided to cut rates even though consumer prices rose 3.6% in the 12 months through June, significantly above the bank’s 2% target. Britain’s unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in the three months through May, the highest level in four years, signaling that previous tax increases and uncertainty about the global economy are weighing on employers.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File) SEATTLE -- The Trump administration on Wednesday canceled a major wind farm development in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden's term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II. The Bureau of Land Management in December signed off on a scaled-down plan for the Lava Ridge Wind Project northeast of Twin Falls, with 241 wind turbines instead of 400. But the development had been on hold since the first day of President Donald Trump's second term, when he issued an executive order halting the permitting of wind power projects across the country and telling the Interior Department to review the Lava Ridge decision. “By reversing the Biden administration’s thoughtless approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, we are protecting tens of thousands of acres from harmful wind policy while shielding the interests of rural Idaho communities," Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. "This decisive action defends the American taxpayer, safeguards our land, and averts what would have been one of the largest, most irresponsible wind projects in the nation.” The project, five years in the works, faced opposition from local residents concerned about the height of the turbines — up to 660 feet (201 meters), or more than twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. The Bureau of Land Management said when it approved the project that it could power up to 500,000 homes and that its decision reflected "a careful balance of clean energy development with the protection of natural, cultural, and socioeconomic resources on this historically significant landscape.” Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have targeted wind and solar projects as expensive and unreliable while taking steps to support the burning of fossil fuels, which is dangerously heating the planet. The tax-and-spending legislation signed by Trump last month phases out tax credits and other subsidies for clean energy, and an executive order issued by Trump a few days later further restricts subsidies for what he calls “the Green New Scam.” Since then, Burgum has issued a series of memos targeting wind and solar power, including a July 17 memo that requires his personal approval of all solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters.

Article: The independent U_N_ investigator on human rights in Afghanistan says its Taliban rulers have “weaponized” the legal and judicial system to oppress women and girls in what amounts to “crimes against humanity." UNITED NATIONS -- Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have “weaponized” the legal and judicial system to oppress women and girls in what amounts to “crimes against humanity,” the independent U.N. The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said. Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls. The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. “Coupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.” Bennett said access to justice for girls “is further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,” including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers. The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled. “Women who engage with the Taliban court system — whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders — face a hostile environment,” Bennett said. “Courts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.” Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras — community councils of elders — and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution “on gender grounds.” And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Clemente) TAPACHULA, Mexico -- Escorted by police and accompanied by a Catholic priest, about 300 migrants began walking north on Wednesday from southern Mexico, even as the activist who helped organize them remained in police custody over allegations of human trafficking. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Luis García Villagrán, the leader of a local nongovernmental organization in the city of Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, for alleged crimes related to his work with migrants. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing on Wednesday that he was “not an activist” but was tied to trafficking people — and “that is the crime.” Sheinbaum said there had been an arrest order pending for García Villagrán for years. Later Wednesday, Mexican authorities said in a statement that investigators had identified a network of migrant smugglers that used various organizations and foundations as a front to move migrants and drugs through Mexico. Heyman Vázquez, a Catholic priest who accompanied the migrants, called García Villagran’s arrest “unjust.” Vázquez said it showed the Mexican government’s concern over migrant caravans, which he said would be resolved by making it easier for migrants to legalize their status.

Article: The Trump administration wants to end two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump's budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn't, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

Article: Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said the additional $600 million provided annually for Medicaid is hundreds of millions short and unless addressed would require reducing optional services, provider rates or both. “This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care," Stein said in a news release. “Despite these serious reservations, I am signing this bill into law because it keeps the lights on.” The new law does cover anticipated enrollment changes for K-12 schools and community colleges, as well as for experience-based pay raises already in state law for teachers. Stein's veto seeks to block a decision by North Carolina legislative leaders to join the tax-credit program contained in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill that he signed into law last month. The program provides starting in 2027 a one-to-one credit equal to up to $1,700 for those who donate to certain “scholarship granting organizations,” with those distributing K-12 private-school scholarships among them. The federal law said each state must opt in to the program, and North Carolina Republicans who have already greatly expanded state-funded scholarships wanted North Carolina to be the first to do so. Stein's veto message aligned with arguments by Democratic state legislators who voted against the state measure last week that the program shifts federal funding away from helping public schools and helps wealthy people who can already afford private school for their children. Stein said he would opt in to the program for the state once the federal government issued sound written guidance on program rules because he sees opportunities to “benefit North Carolina’s public school kids.” So, he added, the bill on his desk is “unnecessary.” The vetoed bill now returns to the General Assembly, where override votes could happen as early as Aug. Republicans are but one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority, and last week lawmakers were able to gain the Democratic support needed to override eight of Stein's 14 earlier vetoes. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said Wednesday that with the veto Stein is "attempting to usurp the General Assembly’s authority to set tax policy” and anticipated a veto override "to ensure North Carolina can participate in President Trump’s signature school choice initiative.” Stein also signed Wednesday legislation creating an expedited removal process for homeowners and landlords to remove people unauthorized to live on their property.

(Ramsey County Sheriff's Office via AP, File) MINNEAPOLIS -- The man charged with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. As they announced the indictment, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter’s federal defender, Manny Atwal, said at the time that the weighty charges did not come as a surprise, but she has not commented on the substance of the allegations or any defense strategies. "Accordingly, the discovery to be produced by the government will include a substantial amount of investigative material and reports from more than a dozen different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.” They said the evidence will include potentially thousands of hours of video footage, tens of thousands of pages of responses to dozens of grand jury subpoenas, and data from numerous electronic devices seized during the investigation. In a series of cryptic notes to The New York Times through his jail’s electronic messaging service, Boelter suggested his actions were partly rooted in the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbor. In messages published earlier by the New York Post, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate. He also reiterated that prosecutors consider Hortman's killing a “political assassination.” Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans’ home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin.

The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. “Despite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,” Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs. At the retail level, Toyota sold 2.4 million vehicles globally, with sales growing in Japan, North America and Europe from the previous year, when global retail totaled 2.2 million vehicles. The models to be produced there are still undecided, but the plant will be part of the company's plan to maintain a production capacity of 3 million vehicles in Japan, according to Toyota.

You're being cut off.'” The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus," the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. "It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day." John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said.

Article: A federal judge in Oregon has issued an injunction temporarily stopping the mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities grants to humanities councils around the country President Donald Trump pauses while speaking during an announcement about Apple with Apple CEO Tim Cook in the Oval Office, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Oregon issued an injunction Wednesday temporarily stopping the mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities grants to humanities councils around the country, saying the cancellations were likely unconstitutional. Simon, an appointee of President Barack Obama, issued a temporary stay on action taken in April by the National Endowment for the Humanities, saying the claims made by plaintiffs in the case were “likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this case is unconstitutional.” Defendants’ conduct reflects a “deliberate decision to flout Congressional command and refuse to spend appropriated funds,” the opinion said, noting, “The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.” The Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled dozens of grants to state and local humanities' councils in April as part of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts. This is one step — among many that are needed — in the large, ongoing endeavor to knit our communities and the country closer together.” The National Endowment for the Humanities did not immediately answer a phone call or email for comment. Simon said in issuing the stay that the record contained “unrebutted evidence of irreparable harms," noting that “when these programs are cancelled, there can be no do over and no redress.“ The judge rejected a request by the NEH that the injunction be stayed. Simon said the defendants were “likely violating statutory obligations and principles of separation of powers that have existed for decades.” The order also stopped the government from “disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs.”

Article: Canadian wildfires burning across northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan are sending smoke through central Canada, the Great Lakes region and the northeastern United States, reducing air quality and visibility in major cities. The summer of deadly flash flooding continues, with two people killed by flash flooding on Wednesday near Spring Hope, North Carolina, when their car was swept away by fast-moving flood waters. On Thursday, a risk for excessive rainfall is in place from the Florida Panhandle up to Southeast Virginia, though the threat will not be as high as it was on Wednesday with 1 to 2 inch totals and possible isolated higher amounts expected with these storms. The wet pattern continues to create cooler than normal conditions for the region bring record-breaking cool conditions in some places, like Richmond, Virginia, which broke its daily record for the coolest high temperature yesterday by only reaching 70 degrees. Meanwhile, fire weather alerts are in places across seven states in the West – Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota -- for critical fire weather conditions conducive for rapid fire spread with any new or existing wildfires in these regions. Extreme heat warnings remain in effect for parts of the Southwest, including Palm Springs, Phoenix and Tucson, as heat advisories are also in effect on Thursday for other areas of the Four Corners region stretching into the Plains as the heat begins to shift east in places like Albuquerque, El Paso, Amarillo, Dallas, OKC, Wichita, North Place, Denver and Sioux City. High temperatures between 108 and 118 are possible for these areas through Friday as record high temperatures are possible for cities like Palm Springs, Phoenix Tucson today and Albuquerque through Friday. The heat is expected to be less extreme for the Southwest heading into the weekend and, into next week, widespread heat will return to the Northeast and much of the country.Severe storms capable of producing a few tornadoes, large hail and significant wind gusts will be possible Thursday and Friday for parts of the Upper Midwest. But for Thursday, the highest threat is centered over North Dakota, including Fargo and Bismarck, as severe storms will also be possible for other like Grand Forks, Billings and Aberdeen. Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images On Friday, parts of North Dakota -- including Fargo -- are under the highest threat again as a few tornadoes, very large hail, and significant wind gusts will once again be possible for this area. Elsewhere, widespread air quality alerts have been cancelled for many areas across the Midwest and Northeast as this round of smoke from the Canadian wildfires begins to thin out, though Chicago still remains under an air quality alert for Thursday due to pollution and wildfire smoke. Meanwhile, the tropics are becoming more active as we approach the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season as Tropical Storm Dexter continues to trek northeast in the North Atlantic, though it does not pose any threats to land in the U.S. An area of showers and thunderstorms off the coast of the Southeast may develop into a low-pressure system in the next 24 hours, though the window of potential development is beginning to wane.

Article: "I think it was pretty loosey goosey for the last year or two, and I think the companies have got a lot better at that right now," said Manish Kashyap, CBRE's global president of leasing. "They're coming up with policies that allow hybrid structures and allow flexibility, but whatever their new policy is, their implementation around that, and the governance around that, is definitely a lot better." Nearly three quarters of the 184 companies surveyed by CBRE said they have met their attendance goals, up from 61% last year. The majority of survey respondents, 67% of companies, said they will either keep their office footprints at the same size or expand them within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago. Concerns about the economy and tariffs do have some companies hesitating to make long-term decisions, but even with that concern, more are taking on long-term leases than were a year ago, CBRE found. "You have organizations that finally have clarity and decision making, because they've been living in this world of hybrid for so long, and now they know what it truly looks like for them, so all those decisions that they may have put off, even if there's a little bit of economic uncertainty right now, they're still willing to move forward with some additional deals," said Julie Whelan, CBRE's global head of occupier research. Despite the fact that overall office vacancies are at 18.9%, just under the 30-year high of 19%, nearly half of the companies surveyed said they were concerned about the availability of high-quality office space over the next three years. That concern is most significant when it comes to prime space, which accounts for only 8% of the total office inventory and has much lower vacancy rate than the rest of the market.

Article: Israeli security cabinet to meet over plan to fully occupy Gaza Israel has taken over about three quarters of Gaza since the start of the war Top UN official Miroslav Jenča told the UN Security Council earlier this week that it would be against international law and was a "deeply alarming" prospect. Israeli media say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees this as the only way to destroy Hamas and free hostages still held by the group following the breakdown of ceasefire talks. Israel's security cabinet is meeting on Thursday to decide on whether to order a complete military takeover of the Gaza Strip – a move the UN says would risk "catastrophic consequences". The GHF has been strongly criticised by the UN and aid agencies, who have accused it of being chaotic and forcing hungry Palestinians to travel long distances in perilous conditions to try to get food. The territory is also experiencing mass deprivation as a result of heavy restrictions imposed by Israel on what is allowed in - something it says is aimed at weakening Hamas. In a meeting with Netanyahu on Tuesday, the IDF Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir, is said to have warned that controlling Gaza could entrap troops and further endanger the hostages.

Article: census to exclude for the first time people with no legal status toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images With preparations for the 2030 census already underway, President Trump said Thursday he has instructed his administration to start work on a "new" census. The 14th Amendment requires the "whole number of persons in each state" to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected. Sponsor Message Trump said he's instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to "immediately begin work" on a census using "the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024." It's unclear why the election results would matter to the census. While Article I of the Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790 for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it's not clear whether the results of a census taken years before 2030 can be used for reapportioning each state's share of seats in the U.S. Former President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term. But research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question "Is this person a citizen of the United States?" is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting tallied in official population totals, which are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country. The Supreme Court found the first Trump administration's stated justification for a census citizenship question — to better enforce the voting rights of racial minority groups — appeared "contrived." As a result, Trump issued a 2019 executive order that spelled out other reasons for producing citizenship data that would be more detailed than the estimates the bureau already releases. A 2020 presidential memorandum ultimately confirmed another goal for Trump's first push for a citizenship question — data that would allow for the unprecedented exclusion of immigrants in the U.S. Sponsor Message Trump's call for a new census comes amid growing support among Republican members of Congress in recent years to use the next decennial head count to tally non-U.S. Additionally, if Trump is referring to the 2030 census, legal experts say that Trump's successor or Congress may — in 2029 — have an opportunity to get rid of any added question about a person's immigration status before it's printed on paper forms for the 2030 census.The Trump administration's renewed focus on excluding U.S.

Article: The period from April though June saw the releases of "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," "Final Destination: Bloodlines," and "F1," which together generated $2 billion in the global box office to date, the company said Thursday. WBD reported total revenue for the studios segment — which also includes distributing TV content — increased 55% during the quarter to $3.8 billion, with theatrical revenue up 38%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, due to the higher box office revenue. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the studios segment was $863 million during the period, up from $210 million during the same period a year prior. In a letter to shareholders, WBD said it expects the momentum to continue, with the studios segment projected to generate at least $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year.

Article: The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy." Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer," Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, "we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap." He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices." If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030. While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals. But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine. India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler. In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price. "Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. "Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line. A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows. "It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Filmed over three years, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home tells the story of the singer and wife Sharon's lives as they try to complete their long-held dream of moving back to the UK. As daughter Kelly Osbourne says in the film: "Iron man wasn't really made of iron." The one-hour film will air on BBC One on Monday 18 August at 21:00 BST and will also be available on BBC iPlayer. It will air just under a month after the heavy metal icon died, which came two weeks after he made it on to the stage one final time for his homecoming gig at Villa Park. "We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy's fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life." A statement from Ben Wicks and Colin Barr, executive producers at Expectation - the company which produced the film - said: "It was an incredible privilege to spend the last few years with Ozzy, as well as Sharon, Jack and Kelly. "Ozzy wanted to make it back to the UK and appear on stage one last time - our film is an inspiring and poignant account of him fulfilling that dream." They added: "Ozzy was loved by millions around the world not just for his music, but for his sense of mischief and his honesty all of which we saw plenty of in the final years of his life.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump began imposing higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to cause visible damage to the U.S. applications for jobless benefits up modestly but remain at a healthy level Despite the uncertainty, the White House is confident that the onset of his tariffs will provide clarity about the path for the world’s largest economy. Risk of economic erosion Hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after the initial tariff rollout in April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. Dismay in India and Switzerland The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump’s tariffs, which have been rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and renegotiated. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to meet Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert a 39% U.S. In a Truth Social tweet, he said, “THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!” The stock market has been solid during the tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market’s rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump’s tax and spending measure signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. But ING’s Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” Trump foresees an economic boom. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

Article: For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it “easy prey for pedophiles.” Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that “no system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.” The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though — as with most moderation rules — people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards. It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission — and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them. "But when you’re thinking about things related to child endangerment or grooming, the types of behaviors you’re looking at manifest over a very long period of time.” Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox — about 6 billion messages per day — and analyzes them for potential harms. “It doesn’t happen on one message because you just send one message, but it happens because of all of your days' interactions are leading towards one of these two,” Koneru said. “Then we say, okay, maybe this user is somebody who we need to take a much closer look at, and then we go pull all of their other conversations, other friends, and the games that they played, and all of those things.” Humans review risky interactions and flag to law enforcement accordingly.

Article: Johner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images Investors may soon have greater access to private assets — that is, investments that are not publicly traded — in their 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a "prudent investment mix" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan. Defined-contribution workplace plans — which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others — held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. "Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets," Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email. "If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are," said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it." The law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries. "It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid," Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst for TD Cowen, wrote in a policy note on July 16. Private assets may be slow to 'gain traction' Private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR have introduced new products to make inroads into defined contribution plans.

Article: Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries. Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program “broken” and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of “inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Kennedy didn’t specify the changes he's seeking. In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program “has taken a hard line” against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to “a nondependent, adult son," according to his financial disclosures. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children’s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm — perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned — and add the condition to the program. The group’s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son’s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

Article: Pavel Bednyakov | Sputnik | via Reuters DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan traveled to Russia on Thursday for his second visit to the country in less than a year, to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sign of the ever-strengthening ties between the two states. The trip, according to Emirati state media service WAM, is focused on the two countries' "strategic partnership" and on "ways to enhance cooperation, particularly in the economic, trade, investment, energy, and other areas that serve joint development, in addition to regional and international issues of common interest." The UAE is a longtime close ally of the United States and a major military and intelligence partner. It is also Russia's most important economic partner in the Middle East — and trade between the two has ballooned in recent years, particularly since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Bin Zayed told his Russian counterpart: "We would like this figure to be doubled both at the bilateral level and with Eurasian countries during the next five years," adding that relations between the two countries "are developing at an accelerated pace." Russia and the UAE signed a strategic partnership in 2018, and numerous visits between their leaders have been exchanged since then. This pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik shows Russia's President Vladimir Putin and President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan attending a welcoming ceremony ahead of their talks in Abu Dhabi on December 6, 2023. Sergei Savostyanov | Afp | Getty Images The visit by the UAE leader to Moscow "says the UAE values its strategic partnership with Russian and will to continue to deepen ties with Russia," Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute focused on Russia's policy toward the Middle East, told CNBC. "As before, the UAE wants to continue to maintain a diversified foreign policy overall between Russia, the United States, and China, rather than choose only one." The UAE leader's visit also comes as the White House announced an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin to discuss Ukraine war ceasefire efforts — and in the wake of Trump announcing punitive tariffs on India for importing Russian oil, which the American leader says is "fuelling the war machine." For Russia, the ongoing relationship with the UAE is a win and is also "clearly a sign that they are not nearly as isolated as the West would like them to be both diplomatically and economically," said Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Rane. For [UAE leader] MBZ on a political front, this is a demonstration that he is independent of Washington, despite relying on American forces for security," Bohl said, referring to Mohammed bin Zayed by his initials. It is an important transit hub for dual-use goods, meaning goods that can have both civilian and military use, so this trade helps fuel Russia's war on Ukraine," Borshchevskaya said.

Article: Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov had said earlier a summit could possibly take place next week at a venue that has been decided “in principle.” READ MORE: Trump envoy Witkoff meets Putin ahead of Russia-Ukraine peace deadline, the Kremlin says No location had been determined Thursday morning, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. “We propose, first of all, to focus on preparing a bilateral meeting with Trump, and we consider it most important that this meeting be successful and productive,” Ushakov said, adding that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff’s suggestion of a meeting including Ukraine’s leader “was not specifically discussed.” Putin made the announcement in the Kremlin after his meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the UAE. Asked who initiated the meeting, Putin said that didn’t matter and “both sides expressed an interest.” According to the White House official, a Trump-Putin meeting would not happen if the Russian leader does not agree to meet with Zelenskyy. Speaking of Zelenskyy’s possible involvement, Putin said he has mentioned several times that he wasn’t against it, adding: “It’s a possibility, but certain conditions need to be created” for it to happen. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund who met with Witkoff on Wednesday, said a Trump-Putin meeting would allow Moscow to “clearly convey its position,” and he hoped a summit would include discussions on mutually beneficial economic issues, including joint investments in areas such as rare earth elements. It would be a significant milestone toward Trump’s effort to end the war, although there’s no guarantee it would stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. At the start of his second term, Trump was conciliatory toward Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration, and even echoed some of his talking points on the war. Poll shows support for continuing the fight waning in Ukraine A new Gallup poll published Thursday found that Ukrainians are increasingly eager for a settlement that ends the fight against Russia’s invasion. The enthusiasm for a negotiated deal is a sharp reversal from 2022 — the year the war began — when Gallup found that about three-quarters of Ukrainians wanted to keep fighting until victory. On the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line snaking from northeast to southeast Ukraine, where tens of thousands of troops on both sides have died, Russia’s bigger army is slowly capturing more land. Only about one-quarter say it’s “very” or “somewhat” likely that active fighting will end within the next 12 months, while about seven in 10 think it’s “somewhat” or “very” unlikely that active fighting will be over in the next year.

Beneficiaries of this could include Apple (especially given that the announcement was made at a White House event with CEO Tim Cook), TSMC, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Micron, and GlobalFoundries." Morgan Stanley "To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief. So where the immediate reaction is to buy companies with a large US manufacturing base, the real optimization is to be prepared for multipolarity - that is, to build in the regions where the product is consumed. The reactionary beneficiaries are Intel, Texas Instruments, Global Foundries, and Amkor." Bernstein "At first glance the application of said tariffs, if applied to "raw" semiconductor imports, would be a bit painful but likely manageable as the US does not import a ton of raw chips (~$45B worth in 2024, with almost half coming from Taiwan and Malaysia). However, the actual implementation is apparently going to be considerably more complicated (with some potential material reprieves), as he indicated that companies building, or committing to build, in the US will in fact face no tariffs." Goldman Sachs "We believe it is likely that some semiconductor companies may choose to increase their investment footprints in the US in order to avoid potential tariff impacts. We believe that the short-term impact on some of these companies is that, all else equal, these named companies may be perceived as "tariff beneficiaries" in the near term, pending more details on implementation." JPMorgan "Apple and Tim Cook delivered a masterclass in managing uncertainty after months and months of overhang relative to the potential challenges the company could face from tariffs. For Apple, this marks a significant increase in investment in the component supply chain in the US, although stopping short of investments in relation to final assembly, but also largely comprising a re-routing of investments to the US rather than incremental investments from a global perspective. Additionally, the exemption from tariffs suggested for Apple on account of the higher investments flips the narrative on the overhang on the shares in relation to tariff uncertainty to now position the company to have the least tariff associated risk relative to Hardware peers, which have to navigate the suggested 100% tariff on semiconductors."

Article: (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) FILE - Bill Clinton, Founder and Board Chair of the Clinton Foundation & 42nd President of the United States, speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative, on Monday, Sept. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) Former President Bill Clinton plans big changes for this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting “by necessity” to address the changing landscape for global development and increasing needs driven by war and climate disasters. “We need to redefine how we show up, how we work, and how we find ways to honor our common humanity,” Clinton wrote in a letter to the CGI community released Thursday. “This September, our goal will be to connect dots across issues, expose the consequences, and confront the complicated issues in front of us.” Since its launch in 2005, the CGI annual meeting has served as a platform for political, business and philanthropic leaders to announce new initiatives or new financial support for existing programs addressing the world’s problems. At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women’s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better. This year’s meeting — held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton — will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. “This year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.” In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI hopes to close those gaps with a series of “Leaders Stage Sessions,” where representatives from a wide range of organizations – including GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan, Center for Disaster Philanthropy CEO Patricia McIlreavy, AFL-CIO President, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten -- will work together to create new initiatives. “Now is the time to stand up and roll up our sleeves — and do our part to reverse the trend lines and begin charting a brighter future,” Clinton said in a statement.

Article: Hurt (Caltech/IPAC)/NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI Just 4.3 light years from Earth lies a star called Alpha Centauri A, which is famous for being the nearest star that resembles our own Sun. It turns out that, in real life, a gas giant planet actually seems to be orbiting Alpha Centauri A, according to astronomers who peered at it with the James Webb Space Telescope. What's more, the planet apparently orbits at a distance from the star where temperatures might be cozy enough for life, according to a pair of reports accepted by The Astrophysical Journal Letters. "Certainly in your science fiction dream, you say, 'Well, if we're going to get anywhere, we're going to be able to go to Alpha Centauri,'" given that it's right nearby in cosmic terms. But even though scientists have been able to discover thousands of planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system in recent years, including some around Proxima Centauri, which is fairly a dim star, it's been difficult to go planet-hunting around Alpha Centauri A and B, which orbit each other. It's just like if you tried to point your cellphone camera at a very bright object, says Beichman: "It just, you know, blurs everything out, or blasts everything out." But the James Webb Space Telescope offered a couple of advantages. It also has "specially-designed masks" that block out the light of a central star "and let you see in close, to see if you can see a planet," Beichman explains. "It's something like a Saturn mass, a Jupiter radius, and just like the gas giant planets in our own solar system, if you move them in closer," says Beichman, who adds that the planet conceivably could even have rings. Temperatures might be in the range of 40 to 50 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, making this "in the outer edge of the habitable zone," he says, but it could have periods that are warmer, given that it seems to have an eccentric orbit that would bring it closer to its star at times. Moon formation around giant planets generally should be quite common," says Mary Anne Limbach , an astronomer at the University of Michigan who has searched for alien moons but wasn't part of the team of researchers working on this planet discovery. She thinks this planet candidate might conceivably even have decently-large moons, like maybe the size of Mars, "in sort of an optimistic case." "I think that's definitely an environment where you could get, potentially, life to evolve," she says, noting that even in our own solar system, many scientists see moons — such as Jupiter's icy moon Europa, or Saturn's hydrocarbon-rich Titan — as the best places to search for life beyond Earth. That means to potentially have a life-supporting moon around this planet candidate, he says, "really you need this planet to have an unexpectedly big moon." So could this star system have a Pandora, like in Avatar? "I think the first thing I want to see before we claim victory and say this is a planet," says Limbach, "is follow-up observations to confirm it." Still, she adds, "I think it's really exciting that our neighbor could have a giant planet, so close by."

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli Security Cabinet is set to meet Thursday to discuss a possible expansion of military operations in the Gaza Strip, a move that would draw fierce opposition internationally and from many in Israel, including the families of hostages held by Hamas. An Israeli official said the Security Cabinet is expected to hold a lengthy debate and approve an expanded military plan to conquer all or parts of Gaza not yet under Israeli control.

A new escalation could deepen Israel’s isolation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been meeting this week with advisers to discuss what his office said are ways to “further achieve Israel’s goals in Gaza” after the breakdown of ceasefire talks last month. Yehuda Cohen, the father of Nimrod Cohen, an Israeli soldier held in Gaza, said from the boat that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to satisfy extremists in his governing coalition. Palestinians killed and wounded as they seek food Israel’s military offensive has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians. Of the 37 people killed on Thursday, 13 were heading toward a distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israeli-backed private contractor, according to hospital records. At least 49 people were killed in the airstrikes that hit the Khadija girls’ school in Deir al-Balah on July 27, 2024, and the al-Zeitoun C school in Gaza City on Sept. MSF runs two medical clinics very close to the GHF sites and said it had treated nearly 1,400 people wounded near the sites between June 7 and July 20, including 28 people who were dead upon arrival.

WATCH: New jazz fellowship honors long-time musicians who often struggle financially Palmieri was born in New York’s Spanish Harlem on December 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle’s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums. His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album “The Sun of Latin Music,” and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams. In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: “Learning to play the piano well.

A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production “Llegó La India vía Eddie Palmieri.” Palmieri released the album “Masterpiece” in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year.

Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge. The Dyer County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that a caller reported a minivan or midsize SUV had dropped the infant at a “random individual’s front yard.” The sheriff’s office later said they were working with investigators in neighboring Lake County, where four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds. Hours before Tuesday's arrest, Jackson Police posted a roughly 20-second video surveillance clip showing someone they said was Drummond wearing camouflage and carrying a firearm, trying to enter the door of an unspecified building. Jackson Police Chief Thom Corley said the calls from the public helped officers arrest Drummond, who had been staying in a vacant building near the woods where he was taken into custody.

The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. Wildlife biologists and a state veterinarian who visited the trail near Tupper Lake, New York, on Wednesday saw that the moose was severely emaciated and showed other signs of advanced disease.

Article: Federal judge rules cuts to humanities grants were 'unlawful' toggle caption Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images A federal judge has ruled that the government's abrupt elimination of humanities grants previously approved by Congress was "unlawful" and that a lawsuit brought by humanities groups can move forward. In April, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), terminated grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities to thousands of groups across the country including humanities councils, museums, historic sites, archives, libraries, educators and media outlets. In May, Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils sued the endowment and DOGE, alleging the sudden grant cuts were an "attempted destruction, spearheaded by DOGE, of the congressionally established federal-state partnership." Sponsor Message In his decision, U.S. Simon wrote that the councils were "likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this case is unconstitutional." He added, "The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President." Simon also wrote that, "Federal funding for the arts and humanities has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades, with Congress continuing to strengthen the statutes governing NEH and provide stable funding generation after generation." In a statement, Phoebe Stein, president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, called the judge's ruling "excellent" but cautioned that "humanities councils are still operating without their Congressionally appropriated funds, and many have already laid off staff and cancelled vital programs as a result." Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, said the ruling is "motivating" and "one step — among many that are needed — in the large, ongoing endeavor to knit our communities and the country closer together." In July, a New York federal court similarly found that the government violated the law when it canceled humanities grants that had already been awarded.

Article: (AP) — A half-dozen soldiers at a Georgia Army base are being hailed as heroes for tackling an armed assailant accused of shooting five people and then giving aid to their wounded colleagues. Quornelius Radford, 28, is accused of using a personal handgun to shoot five soldiers Wednesday at Fort Stewart, one of the nation’s largest Army bases, before he was quickly tackled by other troops, officials said. “The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under trauma and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said at a news briefing Thursday morning.

Also known as the “Spartan Brigade,” the Army has called the unit its “most modern land fighting force.” Located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southwest of Savannah, Fort Stewart is the largest Army post east of the Mississippi River by land area.

In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,” the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April.

In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. Knowledge lost in funding freeze “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. “It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.” John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. WATCH: The possible long-term impact of Trump’s cuts to medical research funding In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” White House pressure a good thing? Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country’s reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior FBI official who served as acting director in the first weeks of the Trump administration and resisted demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in the Jan. The circumstances of Brian Driscoll’s ouster were not immediately clear, but his final day is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The news comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of current director FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked international counterterrorism investigations in New York and had also commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys manpower and resources to crisis situations. Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination.” Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about President Donald Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. These producers "probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean investigators on Thursday requested a warrant to arrest the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol, a day after questioning her over suspicions including bribery, stock manipulation and political influence-peddling. 1 The investigation targeting Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under the government of new liberal President Lee Jae Myung related to Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The investigation team questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday on various allegations, including claims that Yoon and Kim exerted undue influence over the conservative party’s candidate nominations for a parliamentary by-election in 2022. Kim is also suspected of receiving a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and of possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. READ MORE: South Korea’s new president vows to pursue talks with North Korea and bolster ties with U.S., Japan In her brief comments to reporters as she appeared for questioning on Wednesday, Kim issued a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinted that she would deny the accusations against her, calling herself “someone insignificant.” Yoon, who faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, previously resisted an attempt by investigators on Friday last week to bring him to their office for questioning over his wife. READ MORE: South Korea’s impeached President Yoon released from prison as he awaits trial Yoon’s lawyers criticized the repeated efforts to force him to appear for questioning, stating that he has already made clear his intention to exercise his right to remain silent and accusing investigators of infringing upon his rights in order to publicly shame him. After winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident the liberals claim Yoon’s government tried to cover up.

Article: Bonnie Cash | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. "What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. "He cannot rely on that at this point." Overall, the survey of 1,000 people nationwide conducted July 29-Aug 3 showed a series of conflicting political and economic crosscurrents, with individuals and demographic groups offering sometimes contradictory opinions. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards "Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs," said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. "Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation." For example, just 39% of Independents approve of the president's handling of the economy, and that drops to 24% on inflation. The conflicts could be the result of the public simply having trouble keeping up with the breakneck changes to the economy, immigration, taxation and the political system issuing from the Trump administration. Those are the best numbers since the early years of the Biden administration as the nation emerged from the pandemic, and an 11-point improvement from the CNBC survey in April.

Vance’s visit comes after Texas Democrats successfully stalled a vote there this week on a redrawn congressional map, part of a bid to secure five more GOP-leaning congressional seats at the expense of Democrats before the midterms. Indiana is staunchly Republican, but opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation.

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

Article: The census’ data collections will be based on “modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” the Republican president said on his social media platform, an indication he might try to inject his politics into a head count that determines political power and how federal funding is distributed. Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census, and, if so, whether it would be used for a mid-decade apportionment, which is the process of divvying up congressional seats among the states based on the population count. Any changes in the conduct of a national census, which is the biggest non-military undertaking by the federal government, would require alterations to the Census Act and approval from Congress, which has oversight responsibilities, and there likely would be a fierce fight. While the Census Act permits a mid-decade census for things like distributing federal funding, it can’t be used for apportionment or redistricting and must be done in a year ending in 5, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who consults on census issues. “Logistically, it’s a half-baked idea.” It would be almost logistically impossible to carry out a mid-decade census in such a short period of time, New York Law School professor Jeffrey Wice said. “To get all the pieces put together, it would be such a tremendous challenge, if not impossible.” Trump’s Truth Social post fits into an overall pattern in which he has tried to reshape basic measures of how U.S. But there could be legal challenges if he were to reshape the census, which also guides the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal funds to the states for roads, health care and other programs. The 14th Amendment says that “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population. right now The last time the census included a question about citizenship was in 1950, and the Census Bureau’s own experts had predicted that millions of Hispanics and immigrants would go uncounted if the census asked everyone if he or she is an American citizen. Changes to the census could also play into the efforts by Trump to urge several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redraw their congressional maps ahead of schedule in ways that would favor GOP candidates. Despite Texas having redrawn its maps just a few years ago, Trump is pressuring Republicans in the state to redistrict again, claiming they are “entitled” to five additional Republican seats. Last Friday, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after standard revisions to the monthly jobs report showed that employers added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in May and June. “He wants numbers that support his political accomplishments, such as he sees them.” After the citizenship question was stopped by the Supreme Court in 2019, Trump made another effort in 2020, announcing a plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the apportionment figures. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time.” The three liberal justices dissented, saying the effort to exclude people in the country from the population for divvying up House seats is unlawful.

Article: A Fulton County grand jury declined on Monday to indict a former Atlanta police officer in the death of a 62-year-old church deacon who was Tasered following a minor car crash in 2023, officials said. Body-camera footage shows Kimbrough ordering the Atlanta grandfather to sign a traffic citation over Hollman’s insistence that he had done “nothing wrong.” Kimbrough then tries to arrest him and, after a brief scuffle, forces Hollman to the ground. As Kimbrough Tases him, Hollman shouts, “I’m an old man” and “I can’t breathe.” Advertisement A man identified by Hollman’s family as a tow-truck driver later helps Kimbrough restrain and handcuff Hollman by straddling his head and neck. The Fulton County medical examiner classified Hollman’s death as a homicide in a September 2023 autopsy report, citing electrical shock from the Taser and Hollman’s existing heart disease as factors in his death. “Johnny Hollman‘s death was caused by medical complications and his felonious, unlawful resistance of a uniformed officer performing his lawful duties.” Advertisement Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum announced two months after Hollman’s death that Kimbrough had been fired because he “failed to have a supervisor on the scene prior to proceeding with the physical arrest.” The city’s Civil Service Board upheld Kimbrough’s termination in April. “The failure to hold this officer accountable is another painful reminder of how little value is placed on his life by some citizens — even when the facts are clear and the harm is undeniable.” The family’s attorney, Mawuli Davis, said they will meet with the district attorney to discuss next steps. The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said it is weighing whether to present the case again to a grand jury and will make a decision “shortly.” Advertisement “This is a profoundly sad day — not only for the Hollman family, but for all who believe in justice,” Davis said in a written statement. “Despite video evidence, the unwavering courage of this family, and the thorough effort by the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, the criminal justice system has once again failed to hold law enforcement accountable for the death of a citizen.” A chairman at the Lively Stones of God Ministries in Atlanta, Hollman was a caring and charismatic leader, always looking out for his congregation and others, his daughter, Arnitra Hollman, told The Post in 2023. Advertisement The Atlanta City Council reached a $3.8 million settlement with Hollman’s family in May 2024 of a lawsuit last year for the “unlawful use of excessive force against Johnny Hollman.” The family also filed a separate wrongful death lawsuit against the tow-truck driver who assisted Kimbrough and his employer in December 2023.

Article: Tom Lehrer, a social and political satirist who amassed a devoted following in the 1950s and 1960s for routines featuring blithely subversive musical numbers such as “So Long Mom (A Song for World War III),” “National Brotherhood Week” and “The Vatican Rag,” died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lehrer — an Ivy League mathematics teacher who spent his early academic career on the periphery of show business — created a repertoire of songs that subverted saccharine clichés about romance, patriotism and small-town life when they weren’t skewering the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America or the U.S. “All the world seems in tune/ On a spring afternoon/ When we’re poisoning pigeons in the park,” he warbled to the one-two-three of a tinkling waltz titled “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.” Sentimentality was Mr. Get in line in that processional Advertisement Step into that small confessional There, the guy who’s got religion’ll Tell you if your sin’s original His astute social commentary, verbal dexterity and often academic subject matter differentiated him from mere novelty acts. His song “National Brotherhood Week” was a send-up of platitudes about racial conciliation during bloody civil rights encounters and famously envisioned Black singer and civil rights activist Lena Horne and segregationist Alabama sheriff James Clark dancing cheek to cheek. Lehrer was not the only social satirist of the post-World War II period — Stan Freberg and Mort Sahl were contemporaries, and it was the heyday of Mad magazine — but he is the only one still widely known. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Many of his topics, among them the military-industrial complex, the threat of nuclear Armageddon, xenophobia and environmental catastrophe, still resonate with pointed lyrics about moral ambiguity and ethical compromise. His ballad “Wernher von Braun,” focused on the Nazi Germany missile scientist who later worked for NASA: “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?’/‘That’s not my department,’ says Wernher von Braun.” All four of the LPs that Mr. Lehrer made in the 1950s and 1960s are still in print, with one, 1964’s “That Was the Year That Was,” earning a gold record a remarkable 31 years after its release. Demento’s radio show, the first being another avowed Lehrer fan, “Weird Al” Yankovic.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Thomas Andrew Lehrer was born April 9, 1928, in Manhattan, where his father was a necktie manufacturer. He described himself as “Jewish by ancestry — more to do with the delicatessen than the synagogue.” He began studying classical piano at 7 but soon abandoned it in favor of learning the popular songs of the day. His most-cited musical influence was entertainer Danny Kaye, whose delivery in “Tchaikovsky” — a rhyming list of 50 Russian composers recited at breakneck speed — he quickly learned to imitate. As an undergraduate, he wrote the college fight song send-up “Fight Fiercely, Harvard” (“Albeit they possess the might/ Nonetheless we have the will”) that remained a staple of the university’s football games for decades. Three years later, having realized with some surprise that he had accumulated enough material to make a record, he paid $15 for an hour of studio time and recorded the dozen tunes that comprise “Songs by Tom Lehrer” in one sitting. Lehrer told The Washington Post in 1982, “I was often accused of bad taste in the ’50s and ’60s, but the songs which prompted that accusation seem positively genial today.” He was a peculiarly 1950s figure — a well-mannered iconoclast, the antiestablishment figure operating within the establishment. Advertisement In addition to teaching at Harvard, Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — at one point concurrently — he spent 16 years pursuing a PhD that he never completed, and remained a familiar campus figure even during his brief stint in the limelight. Rather than wait to be drafted, he enlisted in the Army (inspiration for his tune “It Makes a Fellow Proud to be a Soldier”) and worked for the National Security Agency from 1955 to 1957. Lehrer was famously ambivalent about performing, and many factors influenced his decision to quit: He eschewed the “anonymous affection” offered by audiences and took a cynical view of his function as an entertainer. In 1964, he was hired to write topical tunes for the short-lived NBC program “That Was the Week That Was.” He did not perform on the show, whose regulars included David Frost, Buck Henry and Alan Alda; his songs were sung on the air by folk singer Nancy Ames. Lehrer complained that the show’s producers took out all the best lines and replaced them with “something vapid,” so the following year he performed them himself on his third and final album, “That Was the Year That Was.” Many of his most trenchant songs hail from this period: “The Folk Song Army,” “Send the Marines” and “National Brotherhood Week.” Mr. Lehrer’s career took an unpredictable turn in 1970, when his Harvard friend Joe Raposo tapped him to write 10 songs for the Children’s Television Workshop show “The Electric Company.” Today the best-known of these is “Silent E” (Who can turn a cub into a cube?/ Who can turn a tub into a tube?). Lehrer — who never married and ascribed the fact to his short attention span — began to divide his time between Cambridge and Santa Cruz, California, where he joined the University of California at Santa Cruz faculty. He spent January through June in California, teaching, among other things, mathematics to liberal arts students, a class he jokingly referred to as “Math for Tenors.” He also taught a popular course in the history of musical theater. The production, a modest success that was later performed in New York, occasioned a burst of “Where Is He Now?” press coverage — a burst that was repeated in 2000, when Rhino Entertainment released a comprehensive three-disc box set of Mr. Writing in the liner notes to the 1997 compilation “Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer,” he said, “If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.” Sophia Nguyen contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. The Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. “We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the Democrats “un-Texan.” “Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said. Hours after Monday's halted House session, a gaggle of Democrats — state lawmakers who left and members of Congress whose lines would be redrawn — mocked Abbott as the weak figure in this battle. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

A sphere is a “perfect shape” because water pressure is exerted equally on all areas, said Chris Roman, a professor at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography. Titan had made more than two dozen deep-sea dives, which put repeated stress on the hull, said Jasper Graham-Jones, an associate professor of mechanical and marine engineering at the University of Plymouth in the United Kingdom.

(Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute via AP) WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic. The findings “solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean," said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study. Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study. “It’s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,” said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was “really smart and significant.” Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. “They’re voracious eaters.” With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population – and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations -- and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to “the rainforests of the ocean.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File) FILE - In this long exposure photo, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a payload of Starlink V2 Mini internet satellites lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., late Sunday, July 23, 2023. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays.

The botched Starliner demo forced Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to switch to SpaceX to get back from the space station more than nine months after departing on what should have been a weeklong trip. “What we learn on these missions is what’s going to get us to the moon and then from the moon to Mars, which is I think the direction that NASA has to be,” Duffy said in a NASA interview. We want to claim that real estate for ourselves and our partners.” To save money in light of tight budgets, NASA is looking to increase its space station stays from six months to eight months, a move already adopted by Russia's space agency. Astronauts would remain on board until the last four to six months of the station's life to handle any breakdowns, with the empty outpost plunging into the Pacific by late 2030 or early 2031.

(AP Photo/Guadalupe Pardo) Archaeologist Jose Aliaga works at the site where city workers discovered ancient remains, from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, and artifacts as they were digging a natural gas line for the company Calidda in the district of Puente Piedra on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, Thursday, July 31, 2025. According to archaeologist José Aliaga, the vessels’ iconography and their black, white, and red colors “allow us to establish a connection with the pre-Incan Chancay culture,’ which is approximately 1,000 to 1,470 years old.” Aliaga told The Associated Press that the individual was found wrapped in a torn bundle, in a sitting position with his legs against his chest, and his team will continue cleaning the remains. “Lima is unique among Latin American capitals,” Aliaga said, “in that various archaeological finds are unearthed during nearly every civil project.” The Peruvian capital, a city of 10 million people, has more than 400 archaeological sites from the Inca era, the 15th century, or earlier, from the pre-Inca period, according to the Ministry of Culture. “But now I know that people older than the Incas have lived there…it feels so exciting.” “It is very common to find archaeological remains on the Peruvian coast, including Lima, mainly funerary elements: tombs, burials, and, among these, mummified individuals,” said Pieter Van Dalen, dean of the College of Archaeologists of Peru.

Article: An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started Anti-death penalty demonstrators gather outside Riverbend Maximum Security Institution before the execution of Byron Black Tuesday, Aug. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was “hurting so bad” while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered. Asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it's hurting so bad," Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm. “Today, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could," attorney Kelley Henry said. “The fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,” Henry said. Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

Article: The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

Article: DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car. The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards. Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon. The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035. But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. “With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement. Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits. Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.” It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years.

(AP Photo/Emily Elconin) Trinity Wilson, 12, holds her five-month-old cousin, Jaylen, as she and her family walk around the Flint Rx Kids Baby Parade event on July 25, 2025 in on Applewood Campus in Flint, Michigan. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played. It was called a “baby parade.” The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump’s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate. Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up. “They are helping us prove that this is possible.” Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. “And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.” A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate. But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care — not just the number of babies being born here. “No wonder people aren’t having children and our birth rates are going down.” The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 “baby bonuses,” a policy similar to Rx Kids.

Article: (Seth Pincus, Elizabeth Fischer, Austin Athman/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH via AP, File) LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission. In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is “highly effective” and “considered to be of major public health interest.” Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. UNAIDS chief Byanyima has previously suggested that President Donald Trump make a deal with Gilead to produce and license its “magical” prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.

Article: West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class In this image from video, a student eats a meatball sub sandwich during lunch in Parkersburg, W.Va., on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. “Where do we start?” Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, “but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.” More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects. Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. “In rural West Virginia, I don’t think it’s really on radar screens.” In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was “really good.” Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: “Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do.

Article: Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful “forever chemicals” years before the federal government acted. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan — among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases. The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state’s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said. John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules. And what we’ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they’ve elected not to.” Mobile home parks without a license are “essentially operating unregulated,” Cherry said. A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 — new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though “the problem is, I’m not resourced for that.” The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year’s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable.

Article: Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah’s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination. More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans’ water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can’t always count on those basic protections. A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. “If you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the ’70s when they were starting, it was, ‘Well, as long as the source … is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it’ll be fine.’ And that’s just not how it works,” Smith said. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee — scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. That means they’re “halfway homeowners,” said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. “It wasn’t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, ‘I don’t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn’t get in my mouth because I don’t know what’s in it,’” she said. I haven’t been able to do that for over a year.” Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there. “People don’t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,” Silva said. The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. When Smith first searched Utah’s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. One July day in 2021, officials with the EPA were out investigating sky-high arsenic levels in the tap water at Oasis Mobile Home Park in the Southern California desert when they realized the problem went way beyond just one place. “It was literally us driving around and going, ‘Wait a minute, there’s a bunch of mobile home parks!’” said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA’s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region. Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks. ”“It’s like spaghetti laying in the ground.” After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that “were barely buried. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner. In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, “I just couldn’t get clear answers.” Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado’s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. “It seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don’t reach that mark, the report said. An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that “contrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa” and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said. According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks — in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance — were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 “hunger hot spots.” That report, by FAO and WFP, mentioned Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories as being of the “highest concern level.” Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen were classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people faced or were projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is “concerning,” driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump. Vinay Prasad “did not want to be a distraction” and was stepping down from his role as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator “to spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday. Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA’s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines. Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder. During Trump’s first term he signed the “ Right to Try ” law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.

The 42-year-old Sangha, who prosecutors say was known to her customers as “The Ketamine Queen,” is charged with five counts of ketamine distribution, including one count of distribution resulting in death. But prosecutors say when the doctor wouldn't give Perry as much as he wanted, he illegally sought more from Plasencia, then still more from Sangha, who they say presented herself as "a celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods.” Perry's assistant and friend said in their plea agreements that they acted as middlemen to buy large amounts of ketamine for Perry from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash a few days before his death.

(AP Photo/Peter Kemp, File) FILE - Mick Jagger, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones perform before a crowd of nearly 250,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, on July 5, 1969, during a five hour concert. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next.

Article: Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, “Different Night Same Rodeo.” “I don't know what I'm doing,” Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. “I just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I’m trying to write other songs that have already been written.” So, he took a step back, and asked himself: “What am I trying to do with my music? “So just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I’ve been through.” On “Different Night Same Rodeo,” those stories are told in big-hearted ballads (“Hell or High Water”), good time stomps (“New to Country”) and varied collaborations, including with country star Luke Combs (“Backup Plan”), the rising pop voice the Kid LAROI (“Lost”), and Diplo (“Ashes”). He's always been open to such eclectic collaborations, anchored in his raspy, charismatic tone — Zimmerman's highest charting song to date is “All The Way,” a hip-hop-country hybrid he features on with rapper BigXThaPlug. “And I want it to feel real, because it comes across not real when it’s not.” For an artist who describes himself as “dealing with a little bit of impostor syndrome,” he seems to know, at least intuitively, what works for himself and his fans.

(Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall." James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. "It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost.

(Elizabeth Williams via AP) NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed. Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request. He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week. Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S.

But that did not quell growing unease within the country, as many viewed the layoffs as a sign of broader and disruptive changes underway in the IT sector, amplified by the growing influence of AI. TCS and its peers have long relied on India's vast pool of low-cost, skilled labor to produce software services, a model now coming under pressure as AI is set to automate repetitive tasks and as global clients demand higher levels of innovation.

Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Article: Businesses across Asia are increasingly warming up to stablecoins for cross-border transactions — a trend set to accelerate further as Hong Kong moves to legalize the use of digital tokens, experts told CNBC. Monthly stablecoin transaction volumes between businesses had surged to more than $3 billion by early 2025, from under $100 million at the start of 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Artemis from May. That has attracted the interest of major payment processors such as Visa , Mastercard , and Stripe , all of which have begun integrating stablecoin support into their payment infrastructure. Capella Hotel, a Singapore-based high-end hotel group, started allowing guests to complete transactions using digital currencies in October last year, due to "growing demand [for] secure and convenient payment option," according to its statement. The boutique handbag reseller is eyeing to expand crypto payments in its Hong Kong branch in the coming months, as well as in its Tokyo branch in the next few years. About 3% of the company's transactions are currently settled in stablecoins — a share that could climb to as much as 20% by year-end, Zhou estimates, translating into half a million Singapore dollars ($387, 512) in monthly revenue. While Beijing sticks to a conservative stance in mainland China, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, has emerged as a regulatory sandbox for Beijing with the aim of preserving its global edge in financial innovation.

Article: fans from Tokyo to Manhattan stood in line for hours to be among the first to get a Switch 2, fueling one of the biggest global gadget debuts since the iPhone launches of yesteryear. Sales within Nintendo's intellectual property-related business — which includes movies and entertainment based on the company's original games — meanwhile declined 4.4% due to a decrease in revenue from "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." Sales from Nintendo's dedicated video game platform business grew 142.5% year-on-year to 555.5 billion yen, driven primarily by a higher price point for the Switch 2, compared with that of its predecessor, according to the company. Here's how Nintendo did in the quarter ending on June 30 versus LSEG estimates: Sales of Nintendo's Switch 2 now total 5.82 million units, the company said in an update on its investor relations website Friday. Despite the bumper quarterly performance, Nintendo maintained its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 2026 unchanged at 1.9 trillion yen and 320 billion yen, respectively. The device, which launched on June 5, sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days and Nintendo expects it will hit 15 million unit sales in the current fiscal year.

Article: Cambodia "This is a good news for the citizens and economy of Cambodia to continue developing the country," Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a Facebook post on Friday after the revised table of tariffs was released. Thailand Thailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said in a post on X that the tariff rate levied on the country "reflects the close friendship and partnership between Thailand and the United States," according to a Google translation of his statement in Thai. However, he said that the government recognizes the impact of the tariffs on entrepreneurs and farmers, and has prepared "comprehensive support measures," including soft loans, subsidies, and tax measures so as to help Thailand adapt. Taiwan will also discuss supply chain cooperation and issues related to Section 232 in the future, he added, referring to the sectoral tariffs that Trump had imposed on national security grounds. 1] general tariff rate will ease and not burden our economy," according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Malay He also confirmed that Trump would be attending the 47th ASEAN summit in October, being held in Malaysia. "What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market," he said, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to local media, the country's Trade Minister Todd McClay said it seemed as though the tariff rates were targeting countries that have trade deficits with the U.S., but that the size of it was "really not significant or meaningful" in New Zealand's case. "Many of the exporters are saying they have been able to absorb the 10 percent, or in many cases pass it on, but at 15 percent it is going to start having a greater effect on our exporters," he said. On social media platform X, the country's federal council, said it noted "with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." "Switzerland has been and remains in contact with the relevant US authorities. "While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong," he said.

Article: Conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch will give President Donald Trump regular updates on his health as part of an agreement to postpone Murdoch's deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him over a Wall Street Journal article about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday. "Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health," the filing says.

Article: trade deficit narrowed in June on a sharp drop in consumer goods imports, and the trade gap with China shrank to its lowest in more than 21 years, the latest evidence of the imprint on global commerce President Donald Trump is making with sweeping tariffs on imported goods. Days after reporting that the goods trade deficit tumbled 10.8% to its lowest since September 2023, the government said the full deficit including services also was its narrowest since then. The economy in the second quarter expanded at a 3.0% annualized rate after contracting at a 0.5% rate in the first three months of the year, but the headline figure masked underlying indications that activity was weakening.

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs. But he added that "I think the devil will be in the detail." Here's what the company reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 78 cents adjusted vs. The results come after Pfizer in April expanded its cost-cutting efforts, which aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the past few years.

Article: (COMBO) This combination of pictures created on February 21, 2020 shows US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 19, 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours. so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said. Russia earlier Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying that India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia." "We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday.

Article: President Donald Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he has narrowed the field of potential future Federal Reserve chairs to four candidates, a list that does not include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The move allows Trump to install another of his appointees to the Fed Board of Governors at a time when the White House is aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates. "Both Kevins are very good, and there are other people that are very good, too," Trump said, adding that Kugler's resignation "was a pleasant surprise." Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. He has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism, and there has been speculation that the president would name a "shadow chair" who could help undermine Powell until his term expires. Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility." Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

And to choose those trade and economic cooperation regimes that are in the interests of a particular country." The dispute between Trump and New Delhi is being closely watched by investors after Trump threatened on Monday that he would be "substantially raising" the tariffs on India, although he did not specify the level of the higher levies. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post. But absolutely that jobs number, if the revision turns out to be true, does suggest that there's less momentum than we thought," said Hassett, director of the National Economic Council who is thought to be a leading contender for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. "What are we doing with a national average 30-year mortgage rate still close to 7% in an economy growing at 1%?" veteran economist and strategist Jim Paulsen wrote in a Substack post. "To me, today's jobs report is what entering a recession looks like," Josh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, wrote after the Friday report.

Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/opinion/genetics-children-noor-siddiqui.html
Article: My guest today is the founder of a Silicon Valley startup that promises would-be parents, a new level of genetic screening for their embryos, and that looks forward to a future where most embryos, and therefore most babies, are screened and selected in advance. And just since it’s going to be important to the larger conversation, one of your views, I think, is that this kind of testing and this kind of process isn’t just for people who are older parents or who have super high risk factors or who are struggling to conceive. No, I wouldn’t assume that you would be locking us in the room, but you but you would be presenting it as a reasonable option for someone in our position to consider. And basically what’s really powerful about Orchid is that instead of getting that really tiny amount of genetic information, you’re able to actually get the entire genome 100 times the data and then use that to make these really important decisions. It’s just I think it’s just really important not to skip over this monogenic side because currently, you can’t test for that large of a set of monogenic diseases during pregnancy. So what that means on a practical level for embryos is that, for example, I’m South Asian, we have unfortunately, incredibly high rates of heart disease and heart attacks were twice as likely to die as other ethnicities. But generally, what you said before is like, you’re dealing with a clientele that is partially people who have family histories of serious genetic disorders and partially people who are what cutting edge minded Silicon Valley types like, what’s the part of the clientele that is coming to you the way that myself as a hypothetical client is coming to you. Yeah, I think that it’s I don’t I just I feel like, to be totally honest, I think it’s just dishonest to try to flatten the set of people who are using the product. So I think the first symptoms that I think she admitted to at least my dad were probably in her early seconds and then I think maybe in her mid seconds is when kind of he pushed her enough to be like, hey, I think this is something that should really be looking into. This idea that there’s this genetic lottery that’s unfolding and some people win and some people lose, and through no fault of their own, someone who I love bitterly, is it going to be able to enjoy the things like being able to see her grandkids and just things that I think and I take for granted that, hey, we’re going to be able to see into old age. But the important thing I think to understand is like for cancer, for example, as a category, we test for monogenic forms of cancer, but not all of cancer is monogenic, if that makes sense. It seemed like the most important thing for me as a future parent was that I wanted to be able to minimize the chance that my child was going to be affected by what affected my mom and what affects, unfortunately, millions of people today. Sure And the first has to do with just the process that we’ve talked about already of amplification, where you are essentially copying a full genome from a smaller sample. And so you are inevitably in doing that kind of process, going to introduce essentially potential error levels and its own form of dice rolling and Russian roulette into the test results that you get back. It’s like it’s a fear that people have is that am I unknowingly reducing increasing risk for another condition and you’re effectively saying it could happen, but it’s not the most likely scenario. Yes however, I would say that the other kind of boogeyman argument of like unknown unknowns, I just don’t find it very compelling because if our standard for any medical intervention was that we’d have to clear the bar for unknown unknowns, we would never do anything right. So when we run a clinical trial for a drug and we find that it’s effective, we don’t say, O.K, but what about in 50 years if this person like self-destructs or falls down dead right. Now that we can quantify the genetic susceptibility to disease, we can see individuals who are 4 times 3 times 15 times, 30 times the likelihood, depending on which genetic risk score that you’re looking at. From our point of view, an Orchid baby born today, who you’re trying to offer a polygenic risk score for on schizophrenia might not manifest schizophrenia until the year 2046. How powerful they are is that they can identify individuals that are anywhere from 3 to 6 to 30 times, depending on which disease it is that you’re looking at. So basically, it would be ridiculous to tell people, that, hey, we’re going to stop offering any drug because we have to wait 50 years to see if it continues to work, if it works in the population that you studied offer it because it’s clear that it works based on a reasonable standard. We provide genetic reports, and parents make their own decisions about which embryo they want to implant and whether they want to discard an Orchid actually advises against discarding any embryo for any reason. And I think that if you think about what people already do for trivial reasons, I mean, people get Botox, people get plastic surgery people do, much more invasive things that are more expensive for really trivial gain. So this question is actually already been asked, nationally to Americans, and 70 percent of Americans are in support of using these types of genetic risk scores to actually understand a risk before pregnancy. And I think one should be skeptical about applying your experience, and I’m glad that it was as easy as it was for you to the experiences of the wider range of women because I would say just from personal knowledge, there are a lot of different experiences with IVF. So the United States has a very, very high rate of cesarean sections, for instance, which are not necessarily medically indicated, but have become a source of convenience and pressure from doctors and so on that has, I think, in certain ways, warped the experience of childbearing in the US. And I think it becomes easy to see a scenario where get a certain kind of medical pressures and expectations that push people towards doing the kind of interventions you’re describing because of, again, I agree, no one is going to be locked in a room and told they have to do this. This is the expectation that the medical system imposes on expectant parents, which is why I think it’s important to think about some of the moral questions and cultural questions right associated with this kind of change. This is something Americans are comfortable with in under the existing IVF system, but they’re comfortable with it in a context where most of the people who are doing this are struggling with infertility and are in a kind of crisis environment, what you’re talking about is, doing this at a much, much larger scale. Is it if I took the trays of embryos that contain you and your husband’s embryonic children and I threw them in the river, what kind of crime have I committed. The first is about the kind of sci-fi dystopian future that a lot of people see hanging around this issue, and it relates to the fact that I think most people’s expectation is that if you can figure out what polygenic scores mean for diseases, you’re going to be able to figure out what polygenic scores mean for athleticism, intelligence, to say nothing of a whole host of superficial traits. It’s a really sad history, I think, for the last 40 years that rich people get to have babies and poor people who don’t, who can’t afford IVF, don’t get to. I think that because it Spurs such moral outrage, this idea that something that would create such an advantage, such a vastly different outcomes, I don’t think that’s something that Americans will choose to only leave to the few that can afford it. I think that even today, with the money that we have today, if we spent it more appropriately, if we spent it more in line with what people’s actual preferences are, we could already afford this for everyone in America today. And I think that if you have, enormous genetic privilege and for you to roll the dice and to get a outcome that isn’t going to lead to disease is in the cards for you, then, of course, go ahead and roll the dice. How do I make sure that my child doesn’t have to suffer in the same way that I do in the same way that my sibling does, in the same way that my parent that I’m a caregiver for does so I mean, I think sex is obviously a very beautiful thing. But I think that it’s Yeah, I think denigrating and dismissive to IVF parents and to IVF babies to say that somehow science babies are inferior to babies that are made the old fashioned way.

Article: In his first half-year in office — amid his tariff campaign, government-slashing moves and immigration crackdown — President Donald Trump has also repeatedly delivered for conservative Christians, who form the bedrock of his Republican support. His faith adviser, pastor Paula White-Cain, proclaimed that in his administration, faith “has been brought back to where it always belongs, and that is center.” Critics say he’s eroding the separation of church and state. Those most vulnerable among us are not these manipulators of Christianity that are seeking nothing but power.” Here are 10 ways Trump has repaid his supporters, particularly conservative evangelicals and Catholics: Crackdowns on transgender identity and treatment Trump has cracked down on transgender identity and medical treatment, long targets of religious conservatives. The University of Pennsylvania, under a federal civil rights investigation, modified school records previously set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by her participation. The order cites grievances voiced by conservative Christian leaders in recent years, though skeptics questioned how those grievances were portrayed and whether the nation’s most dominant religious demographic needed special protections. The commission’s announcement came at a White House prayer event at which Trump said of the concept of church-state separation, “Let’s forget about that for one time.” Evangelical ambassador to Israel Trump appointed former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee reflects the unwavering support for Israel among many evangelicals, who see it as favored by God and largely dismiss criticisms of Israel’s war with Hamas and aid restrictions in Gaza. He pledged to “carry out the president’s priorities, not mine.” Religion in the federal workplace The Office of Personnel Management said in a July 28 memo that federal employees may promote and talk about their religion with fellow employees on the job, so long as it’s not “harassing in nature.” They can display religious items at work and encourage co-workers “to participate in religious expressions of faith, such as prayer,” the memo said. Office Director Scott Kupor said federal workers “should never have to choose between their faith and their career.” Critics said this erodes church-state separation, potentially creating a hostile workplace environment. Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said “this memo encourages federal workers to abuse the power of their positions by imposing their religious beliefs on others.” Supreme Court impact Trump hasn’t made Supreme Court appointments yet this term. But his three first-term picks — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — continue to deliver for the Christian conservatives and their allies from other faiths who cheered their appointments. The high court ruled in June that Maryland parents with religious objections can pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ+ storybooks; that Tennessee can ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors; and that states can block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money.

Article: Burt Jones over how Jones is financing his campaign as both Republicans run for governor in 2026 ATLANTA -- One of the top Republicans running for Georgia governor on Thursday sued the other leading GOP candidate, challenging the legality of the rival's campaign funding. Burt Jones in federal court in Atlanta, asking a judge to permanently cut off Jones' ability to spend money from Jones' leadership committee, a special fundraising vehicle that allows Georgia's governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders to raise unlimited funds. Carr argues that the leadership committee violates Carr's First Amendment right to free speech as well as his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that favors Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone said Jones “is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.” Jones' campaign spokesperson Kendyl Parker called Carr a hypocrite because his office in 2022 defended the same law he is now challenging. The Carr campaign tried to get the state Ethics Commission to investigate the source of a $10 million loan that Jones made to his leadership committee, but the commission declined, saying Carr failed to allege a legal violation. Carr asks the court to block Jones from giving any cash to dark money groups and making any loans to his regular campaign committee during the primary, and wants the magistrate judge to investigate where Jones' $10 million loan came from. Carr's campaign continues to voice concern that Jones could raise unlimited sums to repay his loan and then give the repaid money to his candidate committee to spend in the primary, warning that such laundering would destroy campaign contribution limits.

The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,” Jonathan Gold, Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.

Article: The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump’s budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn’t, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Backup plan Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

Article: QCOM YTD mountain Qualcomm in 2025 Just last Thursday, the stock slid close to 8% after the company posted fiscal third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, posting adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share on revenue of $10.37 billion. Nevertheless, investors – and several analysts – appeared to turn their attention toward Qualcomm's shifting business mix, as the company provides modems to Apple and it expects to lose the iPhone maker as a client for that business in the approaching years. "We understand why the company gets no respect at the moment, but believe there is time to at least do some work on the name," wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a July 31 report. Data centers represent "a new growth opportunity for Qualcomm and [are] a logical extension of our diversification strategy as we continue to demonstrate leadership in CPU performance and NPU efficiency," said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm CEO in a July 30 analyst call. Amon noted on the earnings call that Qualcomm is "engaged with multiple potential customers and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler" as the company expands its data center strategy. "Qualcomm is still in early stages and revenues might ramp only in 2028, but management noted advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler," Bank of America analyst Tal Liani said in a July 31 report. Investors who bought Qualcomm 20 years ago and reinvested their dividends into the stock would have seen a total return of more than 480%, compared to the price return of over 270%, according to FactSet. While investors can decide to set up a dividend reinvesting program to build out their position in a stock like Qualcomm – which would assure that they buy shares at regular intervals regardless of the price – they will want to be selective about committing to a particular name. In that case, a dividend-paying ETF, like the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) or ProShares S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) offers diversification across a basket of stocks and sectors.

In a story first broken by the The i Paper, four tenants who rented a house owned by Ali in east London were sent an email in November giving them four months' notice their lease would not be renewed. Tory Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake accused Ali of "staggering hypocrisy" over the handling of the property - but Ali's spokesman said she "takes her responsibilities seriously and complied with all relevant legal requirements".

Article: British dad 'killed by drone fighting in Ukraine' 1 hour ago Share Save Louisa King BBC News, Liverpool Share Save Stephanie Boyce-Williams Stephanie Boyce-Williams said she pleaded with her husband not to go to Ukraine A British father who volunteered to fight for Ukraine in the war against Russia has been killed by a drone strike, his wife has said. Alan Robert Williams, 35, from Moreton in Wirral went to the country after losing his job despite having no military experience and his family's pleas not to go, Stephanie Boyce-Williams said. She said fellow fighters contacted her to say he had been killed in a Russian drone attack in the Kharkiv region by adding "it doesn't feel real" and she was "in limbo" waiting for official confirmation of his death. The family said they lost contact with him on 2 July after he set off on a mission, and were later told on 14 July he was listed as missing action, and two weeks later a member of his unit confirmed he had died. Ms Boyce-Williams told BBC Radio Merseyside: "I was sitting at home with my oldest son when I got the text through to say they had important information and could they call me so I knew instantly." She said she and others in the family had tried to convince her husband not to go to fight but he was determined. "Once it passed the three-day mark, which is what he originally said he was going to be out for, I was literally checking my phone every single day," Ms Boyce-Williams said. "I said to one of my friends I want my phone to ring and for it to be his ringtone, I do not want a Ukrainian phone number coming up on my phone."

Article: On Martha's Vineyard, Black filmmakers are in the spotlight toggle caption Arturo Holmes/Getty Images When I finally had a chance to sit down with pioneering rapper Slick Rick, one question nagged in the back of my brain: Where was the eye patch? Slick Rick, whose given name is Ricky Walters, was blinded in his right eye as a child and developed a habit of wearing stylish eye patches since his early days in the mid-1980s performing with Doug E. But when we met Saturday at the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, he was chilling behind a pair of mirrored shades — looking less like a hip hop pirate than a moneyed man of leisure summering in the playground of the Black bourgeoisie. Sponsor Message "This, to me, feels like an upscale Black environment," he told me backstage, after I had quizzed him before festival attendees about his visual project Victory, the film version of his first album in 26 years. Maybe there was a little piece that's missing in their soul that this [film] fills up and gives a little inspiration … [But] I don't want to get too crazy out here, you know?" Slick Rick needn't have worried. While the crowd on a Saturday afternoon was a little older and more straitlaced than the club kids who originally made his songs like "Children's Story" and "La Di Da Di" signature hits, they embraced the ambitious visuals and kinetic sounds on Victory, which strung together imaginative videos from the album's songs into one long, trippy film. Assembled with movie star Idris Elba — who is also a DJ and released the album on his label, 7Wallace — Victory is packed with bustling images crafted by Nigerian director Meji Alabi, who worked on Beyoncé's Black is King video project. And the film's expansive visuals dazzle — evoking his grandfather's London living room for the song "Foreign" and dipping into a raucous, makeshift underground club for the song "Cuz I'm Here" — built around house music jams Rick heard Elba spinning during a DJ set. This was a grand return to form for an old rap master; I left the screening and panel discussion hoping it got wider attention so more people could see what Slick Rick and his team had cooked up. This is the vibe at the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, or MVAAFF, now in its 23rd year, providing space for Black artists to roll out ambitious projects in the most welcoming space possible. The Vineyard holds a special place in the hearts of some Black folks — a historic sanctuary and getaway for those who can afford it — and the MVAAFF spotlights work by artists presenting a wide variety of images. Watching screenings and talking with filmmakers over the first few days felt like sifting through an intriguing array of ambitious projects centered on Black life that few other festivals might recognize or encourage. But the audience here has mostly come to admire and support Black artists at a time when making space for historically marginalized voices is derided as reverse racism, DEI shenanigans or worse. Over several days, I saw lots of compelling work: In the dramatic short Lost/Found, Eric Roberts plays an older white man, burdened on his deathbed by guilt in the aftermath of an accident that cost the life of a young Black father. (Howery said he was shooting for a comedic version of Morgan Freeman's character Joe Clark from the film Lean on Me.) Written by co-star Barshea Lowery, the movie features five alumni accidentally locked in their old cafeteria during a 10-year reunion, in a Black-centered version of The Breakfast Club. Lowery, a native of my hometown of Gary, Ind., told me he crafted the film as an answer to all the John Hughes films set in nearby Chicago that featured zero Black people. And while watching his film packed with jokes centered on characters I knew, set in a town where I had also grown up, I felt the kind of connection that was immediate and satisfying — even beyond what I felt watching The Breakfast Club in the theater back in 1985. The biggest outpouring of joy I saw at the festival this year, however, was when TV producer Mara Brock Akil screened the last episode from the first season of her Netflix series Forever for a standing room only crowd. Akil, creator of classic Black-centered sitcoms like Girlfriends and The Game, has been a resident of the Vineyard for years, tipped to the area back in the mid-1990s when she was on the writing staff of Moesha. And its fifth episode, "The Vineyard," is set on the island, emerging as something of a love letter, showing the rhythms of a successful Black family who had been vacationing there for years. toggle caption Elizabeth Morris/Netflix "I felt like I was bringing the baby home and everybody thinks she is cute," said Akil after finishing a Q&A after the screening, where she told a rapturous audience she saw this story as her version of the classic romantic film, The Blue Lagoon. "You know, [when they started filming the episode] there was this moment when the crew comes in, and I wondered, 'Oh boy, did I mess up by bringing work to my place of rest?' But then I remembered … just make sure you reflect the story, not just of Black culture, but the culture of Martha's Vineyard." In describing her connection to the island, Akil uses a word Black folks sometimes don't deploy when talking about living conditions: Relaxed. But she acknowledges that the push against diversity and inclusion in corporate America and Hollywood has made the industry more hostile to Black creative people just starting out; she's hopeful her appearance at the festival offers some encouragement to the aspiring filmmakers in the crowd. Sponsor Message "[Corporations] are pulling back on spending and some people are going to automatically drop out of the business — and once they get pushed out, it's hard to get back in," Akil said. So I think we have to pivot to building a new community … that's what I'm looking for." Based on what I saw, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is one powerful place to build and grow that spirit.

Article: The judge's decision on Thursday comes after Wednesday's hearing only saw five witnesses called to the stand by the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit, instead of the multiple state and federal officials who were set to testify. Attorneys representing Florida officials have argued that the facility was initially funded by, constructed and managed by the state and is therefore exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act -- the main law being used to challenge the facility's compliance. Alligator Alcatraz has so far operated in what immigration advocates have described as a jurisdictional gray zone -- with the facility funded by the federal government but run by the state of Florida -- that they allege allows officials to skirt some legal requirements. Ron DeSantis has previously argued that the state of Florida is "implementing" the federal government's immigration policy with the expectation that the state would be fully reimbursed for the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, but local and federal officials have so far been unable to tell the federal courts who is actually in charge of the facility. The hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are testifying -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a "one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda." Located 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees.

Article: Mary Kay burns incense at the entrance to the state-managed immigration detention center dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades on August 03, 2025 in Ochopee, Florida. A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Article: READ MORE: Trump says he plans to put 100% tariff on computer chips, likely increasing electronics costs “We are still waiting for official guidance,” said Limor Fried, founder and engineer at Adafruit Industries, a small electronics maker in New York. “For many of these tariffs, we often have to wait until we get a bill to know our exposure, and then we adjust our pricing to account for the increases.” The U.S. economic pain is surfacing “The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. READ MORE: Trump says Intel’s CEO must resign, sending its stock tumbling But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the artificial intelligence boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, which supplies chips to the auto industry, said in an emailed statement Thursday that it “can’t speculate about potential semiconductor tariffs” and Trump’s announcement, “as no official documents have been published at this point.” These producers “probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. It’s also not clear how the chip-specific tariffs would apply to trading partners that already made broader deals with Trump — such as agreements with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that tax most goods at 15%.

Trump’s announcement could be a signal for other chipmakers to imitate the investments that companies like South Korea’s Samsung are making, said Long Le, a business professor at Santa Clara University. But with China’s SMIC and Huawei unlikely to be exempted, it could also give the Trump administration “more leverage at the trading table” ahead of an upcoming deal with China, he said.

"In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement," Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role. "He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job," Trump added. "Congratulations Stephen!" Miran's appointment comes amid continuing speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" whose job it would be mainly to act as a gadfly on the board.

The bookselling chain posted on X that it was "truly sorry to hear about any negative experiences," and told the BBC that the safety of attendees was "never at risk". Kellie Greenhalgh said it was "extremely busy" when she arrived at the shop for the annual event, where readers meet authors, access early copies of books, and attend panels and workshops. "The queues were all on the stairs, all in front of the lifts." The 33-year-old said she queued for an hour and a half to reach one stall: "I was shaking and did not feel well from the heat and stress". Kellie Greenhalgh Attendees said there was serious overcrowding at Wednesday's event Hanna, 35, said she was frustrated because such events were a "lifeline for connecting with others," particularly for disabled booklovers, and said the event should have been fully ticketed. "There was still shoppers trying to browse the shelves pushing through the queues, some with children or more elderly people who had no idea about the event," Amy White said.

District Judge Kathleen Williams for the two-week pause in new construction at the facility in the Everglades followed a hearing in a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians. “We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” Eve Samples, executive director at Friends of the Everglades, said in a statement. Anna Eskamani (D), who testified at the hearing in support of the conservation groups, called the order “a necessary and welcome step in stopping a project that never should have been approved in the first place.” “This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country. It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources,” Eskamani said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph) PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A wealthy businessman was slated to become president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council on Thursday, marking the first time that the private sector is in control of the country’s two executive branches. “People of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us…in the battle to free the country,” Jimmy Chérizier, best known as Barbecue and a leader of Viv Ansanm, said in a video posted on social media. Wearing a bulletproof vest and with an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder, Chérizier rattled off the names of several neighborhoods, asking that residents give them free passage to reach the council's office. He’ll be working with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a one-time president of an internet company in Haiti and also a former president of the country’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

Article: Cacio e pepe: Good Food pasta recipe sparks fury in Italy 20 minutes ago Share Save Sofia Bettiza BBC News, Rome Share Save Getty Images Italians have reacted with fury after the popular UK Good Food website published a recipe for a traditional Roman dish that did not include the correct original ingredients and appeared to belittle it as a quick eat. Pasta cacio e pepe is a beloved Roman dish, renowned for being simple yet surprisingly challenging to make - so Good Food's description of it as something that can be quickly whipped up for "a speedy lunch" irritated many. Mr Pica said: "This iconic dish, traditionally from Rome and the Lazio region, has been a staple of Italian cuisine for years, so much so it has been replicated even beyond Italy's borders." He regretted contradicting the British site, but clarified that "the original recipe for cacio e pepe excludes parmesan and butter. The furore has been widely covered in Italian media, with a journalist at public broadcaster RAI saying: "We are always told, you are not as good as the BBC… and then they go and do this. The suggestion of adding some cream gave me goosebumps." The Good Food food brand was owned by BBC Studios (the BBC's commercial wing) until 2018, when it was sold to Immediate Media Co - with the BBC prefix being dropped from its name last year. "It's terrible!" says pasta restaurant owner Giorgio Erami While some chefs may experiment with the dish, the main concern is that the website misled readers by presenting its version as the original. Then it becomes something else." He added: "You have to yield to Caesar that which is Caesar's!" Giorgio Eramo runs a fresh pasta restaurant near St Peter's square - serving up cacio e pepe and other traditional pasta dishes.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is recognizing nearly 100 recipients of the Purple Heart at the White House on Thursday, including several service members who gave him their own medals after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania campaign rally. Three men who sent Trump their medals after the 2024 shooting in Butler are expected to attend the event in the East Room to mark National Purple Heart Day, according to a White House official. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are also expected to be there, along with Chris LaCivita, Trump’s former campaign co-manager and a Marine veteran who is also a Purple Heart recipient. After a shooter’s bullet pierced the upper part of Trump’s right ear in Butler just days before the 2024 Republican National Convention, the then-Republican presidential candidate was gifted medals from some Purple Heart recipients. The Purple Heart, the oldest military award still in use and is awarded to service members who are killed or wounded while engaging in enemy action or resulting from acts of terrorism.

Article: In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WASHINGTON, DC August 6: US President Donald Trump shakes hands with CEO of Apple Tim Cook during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday August 6, 2025. "The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back." Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt. "CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time," said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple. "What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters," said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S. For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning , in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an "investment" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning "already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets," adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year. Other partnerships are with Applied Materials , a tooling company, GlobalFoundries , a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is suppling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips. While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that "the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook." Trump had a different take. In Apple's fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach.
