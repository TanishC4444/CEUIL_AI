Article: Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing on President Donald Trump's nominees to lead the National Economic Council, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are asking Google and its YouTube unit whether discussions with lawyers for President Donald Trump have included the possibility of settling a censorship suit in exchange for potentially favorable treatment from the administration. Bernie Sanders of Vermont asked the executives about conversations with Trump's lawyers over an ongoing lawsuit Trump filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform of unlawful censorship. The senators highlighted reports of a court filing from May indicating that lawyers representing YouTube and Trump were "engaged in productive discussions." In that filing, the two parties asked the judge to delay a June court hearing until Sept. "We are concerned about the possibility that Google could settle the lawsuit against YouTube in a quid-pro-quo arrangement to avoid full accountability for violating federal competition, consumer protection, and labor laws, circumstances that could result in the company running afoul of federal bribery laws," the letter said.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs. But he added that "I think the devil will be in the detail." Here's what the company reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 78 cents adjusted vs. The results come after Pfizer in April expanded its cost-cutting efforts, which aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the past few years.

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of." An mRNA model is placed in front of the "Area 100 R&D" research laboratory for personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccines at a new facility of BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, on July 27, 2023.

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

Article: UnitedHealth Group revealed Thursday it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices, adding to a string of setbacks for a company that owns the nation's largest and most powerful private insurer. In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

Article: Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty Images For well over a decade, Grace Hamilton, 27, experienced hair loss, heavy periods, infrequent menstrual cycles, mental health issues and difficulty losing weight without knowing why. After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety "I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years." Cree, who is also a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. In a recent survey of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter. Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar." Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s. "All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a recent survey from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.

Article: The Bank of England voted by a fine margin to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday as the central bank resumed what it describes as a "gradual and careful" approach to monetary easing. The BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at its latest monetary policy meeting, but traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the decision among the bank's policymakers. As it turned out on Thursday, the nine-member MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the key interest rate, the "Bank Rate," by 25 basis points rather than keeping it on hold. Policy makers have had to weigh up sticky inflation — the consumer price index (CPI) rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — with a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth. In a statement Thursday, the bank said the MPC "remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term." The MPC was initially split on reducing or holding interest rates with four members wanting to hold rates, four others voting to cut and one policymaker voting for a larger 50-basis-point cut.

But as it faces the specter of rebuilding its devastated state after 13 years of war under a new government with a very shaky hold on power, the country needs all the help it can get, regional analysts say — not further punishment. "After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC. "While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States." A collapsed state Syria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post.

Another potential reprieve came as the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs told Reuters on Friday it understands the 39% tariff will not include the pharmaceutical sector, which is separately facing volatility from Trump's latest comments on drug pricing. Switzerland's federal council said it had "great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland."

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Article: President Donald Trump talks to the media as he meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (not pictured) at Trump Turnberry golf club on July 28, 2025 in Turnberry, Scotland. tariffs on incoming goods look to be settling in only slightly less than what President Donald Trump had threatened in April, but the difference has been enough to ease some of Wall Street's worst recession fears. With the U.S.-European Union trade deal over the weekend, it now appears that the effective tariff rate, or the net impact aside from the nominal level, will end up in the 15%-20% range. That's well above the low single-digit rate in place at the beginning of the year, but well off the feared 25% rate or worse that could have happened as a result of the April 2 announcement. Tariffs still a danger Commentary around Wall Street following the U.S-EU deal for 15% tariffs echoed the belief that the recession risk had dimmed, even if tariffs still have the strong potential to exert a stifling impact on growth. "We still believe the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation: Not a recession, but a backdrop where the adverse effects of trade and immigration controls on growth outweigh the boost from deregulation and fiscal largesse," Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Zezas wrote. economy skewing toward a slowdown, but with more clarity on the fiscal situation and deficits now front-loaded, the risk of a substantial recession is easing." The U.S.-Europe deal will give the Federal Reserve more to chew on this week when it discusses the impact that tariffs will have on inflation. Since Trump has taken office, the Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate steady, in large part because policymakers are cautious over the impact tariffs will have on inflation. The Fed is expected to approve a rate cut in September, and the chances of that happening seemingly would increase if the economy weakens while inflation is held in check. "But with major trading partner tariffs stabilizing closer to 15% than the much higher rates proposed on April 2, markets and Fed officials will be increasingly confident that the drag on growth and upside risk to inflation will be modest."

Article: "I got that to mean that I think he's going to start recommending lower rates." Powell and his fellow policymakers have been reluctant to lower rates as they wait to see the impact Trump's tariffs have on inflation. Prior to Trump's remarks, White House budget director Russell Vought kept up the heat on the Fed's renovation project, pushing the case for a review of the central bank while pressing for lower interest rates. "There's a whole host of issues with regard to the Fed, and we want to make sure that those questions get answered over time," Vought said during the "Squawk Box" appearance. "This is not a pressure campaign on the Fed chairman." The tone following Thursday's meeting was more conciliatory after months — and even years — of rancor between the Trump White House and the Powell Fed. Both sides characterized the tour as positive, with a Fed official releasing a statement Friday saying the central bank was "honored" to welcome Trump as well as other Republican officials.

Article: AYLESBURY, ENGLAND - JULY 24: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India walk in the grounds at Chequers on July 24, 2025 in Aylesbury, England. and India's bilateral trade is set to get a more than $34 billion annual boost over the long term following their free trade agreement, with the countries' leaders calling it a "historic" deal. The FTA, which slashes duties on goods including textiles, alcohol and automobiles, was signed Thursday in the presence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer. India's Modi lauded the agreement as "a blueprint for our shared prosperity," highlighting how Indian goods including textiles, jewelry, agricultural products and engineering items would benefit from a better access to the U.K. The U.K.–India trade pact marked a "strategic win" for New Delhi's trade diplomacy as it brings targeted benefits to Indian goods that previously faced high tariffs or regulatory barriers, said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ Bank.

Article: Horacio Villalobos | Corbis News | Getty Images The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates steady amid major economic uncertainty, as the European Union scrambles to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.S. "The environment remains exceptionally uncertain, especially because of trade disputes," the ECB said in a statement, adding that its inflation and growth outlook from June remained supported by recent data. While annual inflation in the euro area hit the central bank's 2% target last month, traders widely expected a hold in July — in large part due to geopolitical volatility. As of Thursday, the future of that trade relationship remained up in the air, with one possibility being a 15% baseline tariff rate on all EU imports to the U.S., along with retaliatory measures on the EU's part. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane told CNBC earlier this month that "the last cycle is done, bringing inflation down," but that policymakers would remain alert to any changes in the medium-term outlook. Growth risks 'tilted to downside' In a news conference following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the euro zone economy had performed better than expected in the first quarter. Stressing current levels of uncertainty in forecasting, Lagarde went on to say that risks to growth were "tilted to the downside," with an escalation in trade tensions potentially dragging down exports, investment and consumption, as well as weighing on business and household sentiment. Lagarde noted Thursday that a stronger euro could "bring inflation down further than expected" and that higher global tariffs could concurrently dampen price rises, if countries with overcapacity reroute their exports to the euro area. That is still up from a rate of around $1.026 at the start of the year, as investors have broadly shifted away from the greenback due to political and fiscal uncertainty. Higher fiscal spending and extreme weather events also risk an uptick in inflation, she said, describing the current situation as "wait and watch" but policy overall as in a "good place."

Article: Recycling the metal also consumes only 5% of the energy it takes to produce the same amount of primary aluminum through a smelter, making it more environmentally friendly, according to the International Aluminium Institute, a trade association. That has provided a windfall for some domestic producers but has pushed up costs through the supply chain, with downstream users like PepsiCo and Campbell Soup facing price hikes on everything from beverage cans to tinplate steel. The United States, which until recently exported about 2 million tonnes of scrap annually , has begun to export much less, partly because of the lack of supply but also because of diversion to feed local recycling capacity. "There is a clear incentive to export scrap from Europe to the U.S.," said Hydro's Christophersen, though he noted that volatility in the transatlantic trade environment is limiting those flows. "We're not seeing a lot of scrap exports [from Europe at the moment] because the trade environment is so volatile and are fully dependent on where Europe ends up when it comes to tariff [with] the U.S.," he added. A compelling business case Building a new recycling facility requires only about 10% of the capital expenditure and can be completed in one to two years, less than the five-to-six-year timeline for a traditional smelter.

Article: NFL preseason game ends early after serious injury to Detroit Lions' Morice Norris toggle caption Brynn Anderson/AP ATLANTA — Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris was in stable condition after he was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance Friday night in Atlanta, with the preseason game ending early. We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support." Norris was hurt with 14:50 to go trying to tackle running back Nathan Carter. When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage as the clock continued to run. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back's midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we've all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it." Campbell and Falcons coach Raheem Morris made the decision to not finish the game. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board." Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. "We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone's eyes and see that." Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

But she agreed to stay on to help a colleague investigate why the agency's informants in the Soviet Union had "gone dark," as they say in spycraft, in 1985 and 1986. "We owed all these people who had made the sacrifice." Their investigation led them to look closely at Aldrich Ames, whom they knew as "Rick." He was the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, and knew about all of the agency's informants in the USSR. Sandra Grimes scrutinized activity logs and financial statements and noticed that three times after Ames had lunch with a Soviet embassy official in Washington, D.C., he deposited thousands into his bank account. "It didn't take a rocket scientist to add one plus one plus one." Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and pled guilty to espionage, after taking millions of dollars for his spy work for the Soviet Union. Her work was crucial in catching and stopping a Soviet agent who, the Senate Intelligence Committee said, "caused more damage to the national security of the United States than any spy in the history of the CIA."

Article: Allan Ahlberg, author of over 150 children's books including the classic “Eat Peach Pear Plum,” has died at 87 This undated photo supplied by Penguin Random House shows British author Allan Ahlberg, who has died at the age of 87. (Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

Article: A week removed from a brutal payroll report that triggered worry over a tapped consumer and a trapped Federal Reserve, the broad stock indexes are back at the cusp of all-time highs, market volatility has returned to year-to-date lows and some investors are calling off the August hurricane watch. The S & P 500's 2.4% gain last week and the Nasdaq 100's 3.7% ramp to a new record was a matter of investors staying out of danger by hiding behind their big brothers, the mega-cap giants that have long acted both as defense and aggression in this bull market. The S & P 500 added around $850 billion in market capitalization during the week, and $400 billion was kicked in by Apple alone, which went from conspicuous laggard to market redeemer after a pledge to invest an incremental $100 billion in the U.S. The acute worry prompted by last week's steep downward revisions to payroll growth since the spring was allayed by resurgent market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, abetted by a chorus of more dovish rhetoric. equity strategist Venu Krishna suggests the market by early August had grown a bit complacent toward the macroeconomic trajectory, before investors were jolted to attention by the weak July payroll report a week ago Friday. He suggests, sensibly if not surprisingly, that, "Going forward, we think equities need support from both earnings and macro to continue working at these levels, which is complicated by the still-evolving tariff backdrop and challenging August seasonality." Meantime, a dozen S & P 500 stocks fell more than 10% last week, nearly all on poorly assessed earnings or outlooks, with Eli Lilly disgorging 18%, ON Semiconductor falling 16% and digital-ad marketplace Trade Desk collapsing 37%. The severe punishment of companies missing either official forecasts or investors' informal expectations has been a popular talking point in recent months, with Bank of America calculating that companies falling short on both revenue and earnings have seen their stocks lose more than triple the average amount seen over the past 25 years. And yet, such treacherous action is scarcely visible when looking at the S & P 500, which remains in a solid uptrend, just under 6,400, having flattened out the past two weeks well above what most would view as credible support around 6,150 – which is both the pre-Liberation Day peak from February and near the 50-day moving average. Concentration risk Apollo strategist Torsten Slok, whose charts go viral (on a Wall Street scale), notes that Nvidia , at 8.2% of the S & P 500, is larger than any top-weighted stock since at least 1981 — and also likely the most expensive top index component since then on a price-to-earnings basis. It's a winner-take-most index for a winner-take-most economy, in which AI is the source of most of the investor enthusiasm and AI-related capital spending is the key marginal source of GDP growth. Granted, the equal-weighted S & P 500 over the past three years has lagged the annualized total return of the market-cap-weighted S & P 500 by seven percentage points (16.9% to 9.5%) but hey the equal-weight has returned 9.5%. The Nasdaq 100 index is just about back up to 28-times next 12 months' forecast earnings, a level only exceeded in the past two decades during the manic Covid-pandemic rally. That $420 billion in Johnson & Johnson is backed by $93 billion in 2025 revenue and an expected $26 billion in net income, not to mention a 200-year-old brand, a 3% dividend yield and one of only two triple-A-rated balance sheets left in the market. Palantir's $440 billion is perched atop just $4.1 billion in revenue this year, $1.6 billion in net income – but the company boasts one of the most profitable and fastest-growing software businesses seen in many years, if ever, and is clearly a favored partner to the current U.S. No appetite for value or defense We can similarly observe that the market is in an "Everybody wins" phase when it comes to the largest players in the AI buildout, on both the "hyperscaler" and hardware side. As for any potential value resurgence, we're not quite as deep in the trough as in 1999, and much of the value relative comeback then came from expensive growth crashing rather than cheap stocks soaring.

Article: Police make arrests at Palestine Action ban protests 15 minutes ago Share Save Emma Rossiter BBC News Share Save PA Media Police are arresting protesters in London at a demonstration in support of proscribed group Palestine Action. The government proscribed the Palestine Action group in July under the Terrorism Act of 2000, making membership of or support for the group a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. In the hours before the protest, the Metropolitan Police had issued a statement saying: "Anyone showing support for the group can expect to be arrested." Footage from the square showed officers moving among the protesters, who were mainly seated on the ground, and speaking to them before leading them away. "Officers have moved in and are making arrests." The protest comes just days after the first three people to be charged with supporting the group in England and Wales were named. When it announced the protest, Defend Our Juries said: "Together, in numbers, we will stand against UK complicity in Israel's genocide." As well as the protest by Palestine Action, two marches have been organised by Palestine Coalition and pro-Israeli group Stop the Hate and will be held on consecutive days in central London. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan warned that officers would be ready to arrest anyone showing support for Palestine Action and urged people to "consider the seriousness of that outcome."

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump.

Article: But the 162,000-square-foot former Sears space was sold to a local church, Crossroads, which has transformed 90,000 square feet of the former store into a house of worship and community hub with a traditional indoor entrance to the rest of the mall. "But Crossroads has a huge following, and they are so community driven that I think any mall in the world would be lucky to have a partner like that." It's fair to ask if a struggling mall is the right place for a church, and Matt Castleman, the pastor of Crossroads Church in Dayton, said the religious organization had its own reservations. Teenagers fan the mall after services to eat at the food court and show back up at the church with bags from stores like Claire's and Dick's Sporting Goods , Castleman said. But filling old anchors with new, niche businesses or destinations, like in the case of the Dayton Mall with its new church tenant, is precisely the type of "cross-shopping" mall landlords are seeking. The trend of repurposing empty anchors, which in some cases began a decade ago, took a long time to bear fruit, said Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, one of the largest mall landlords in the U.S. There are former Sears' locations in the CBL portfolio that were generating $7 million to $8 million a year, with newly filled, subdivided ones bringing in a combined five to six times that amount, according to Lebovitz. A variety of different businesses are filling those voids, from restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, to large retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, entertainment options like Dave & Buster's, or hotels. "Gen Z loves the mall; they love the experience of the mall and being in person with each other at malls," said Kirsten Lee, executive vice president of luxury leasing at Brookfield Properties. That has helped to increase the amount of crossover shopping, Lee said, with customers who may hit the lanes for some games of bowling and then go look for a new shirt. "Now we are starting to see enclosed malls do it." Hottovy credits much of the success to non-traditional anchor selections, with malls incorporating a variety of tenants into their mix. "Malls are absolutely places we are interested in being a part of," said Jason Stryker, head of real estate and development for Barnes & Noble, which has been lauded for its turnaround. The company is considering adding 10 more enclosed mall locations this year and is actively exploring approximately a dozen now-vacant Forever 21 sites, which are often sprawling and sometimes two stories high, making it a good fit for a Barnes & Noble layout, Stryker said. "We like to be around stores where people will cross-shop," Stryker said, adding that Barnes & Noble can be especially appealing to malls because "We really don't compete with any other retailer there." Developers point to something intangible that malls capture, nostalgia, and they may be onto something. "Most Gen X and millennials spent their adolescent years making memories in malls – going to the food court with their friends, smelling all the lotions or perfumes at a store, or just generally hanging out chatting," said Dr.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. "I have so many people who come to me and say to me, 'I love your music, I want to give, but I'm sorry, I don't carry cash,'" said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. There's no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. "I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, 'Thank you,' because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away," Deitz said. "But then people that didn't pay see those people walk away, and they go, 'Well, I guess it's acceptable to walk away.'" For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. "People would stop and talk to us." Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. "You might think that it's worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you're getting cash out of your wallet and you're fumbling around for change." But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think "tipping culture is out of control." That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.

Article: LONDON -- On the heels of Israel's security cabinet approving plans to occupy Gaza City, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said "this further escalation will result in more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction," according to a statement released Friday morning. "It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-State solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination." A Palestinian boy carries a stroller at the site of a morning Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, Aug. Mahmoud Issa/Reuters European Union Council President Antonio Costa strongly urged the Israeli government to reconsider its decision to take over Gaza City, saying it will only worsen the situation in Gaza. "Such an operation -- together with the continued illegal expansion of settlements in the West Bank, the massive destruction in Gaza, the blockade of humanitarian aid, and the spread of famine -- not only violates the agreement with the EU announced by the High Representative on July 19 but also undermines fundamental principles of international law and universal values," Costa said in a post on social media. Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, announced Friday it will suspend the exports of arms to Israel that could be used in the Gaza Strip "until further notice." Germany said the "release of hostages and purposeful negotiations on a ceasefire are our top priority." "The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved last night by the Israeli Security Cabinet, makes it increasingly difficult, from the German government's perspective, to see how these goals are to be achieved," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement. Israel's military will "take control" of Gaza City under a new plan approved by the Premier's security cabinet, touching off a wave of criticism from both inside and outside the country. Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images In response to Israel's plans to take over Gaza City, Hamas claimed this was the reason Israel withdrew from the last round of negotiations, and that they had been "on the verge of reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange." Hamas called Israel's latest plan a new war crime, saying the Israeli government "do not care about the fate of their captives," and that they are sacrificing them. Hamas reaffirmed "maximum flexibility and positivity" toward a ceasefire, but warned Israel the current plan "will come at a high cost and will not be a walk in the park." Family members of hostages and other protesters gathered in front of the building where the Israeli cabinet was in session to protest Netanyahu's current proposal to occupy all of Gaza, calling the move a "death sentence" for the remaining hostages in a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. Now it's necessary to do the one thing the government hasn't yet done - put a comprehensive deal on the table that will bring them all home together," said Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest. "The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will prepare for the takeover of Gaza City while ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones." Turk, however, said that the potential escalation will only lead to more problems in the region. Palestinians arbitrarily detained by Israel must also be immediately and unconditionally released." Palestinians inspect the site of a morning Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, August 8, 2025. Mahmoud Issa/Reuters In a Fox News interview earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said repeatedly that he does not want to "govern Gaza," but he wants to "hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening" Israel. Hamas, responding to the Fox News interview, said in a statement that "Netanyahu's statements represent a blatant reversal of the negotiation process and clearly expose the real motives behind his withdrawal from the latest round of talks, despite us nearing a final agreement." On Sunday, an Israeli official told ABC News that Netanyahu was pushing to expand the military operation in Gaza on the grounds that he felt Hamas is not interested in reaching a new ceasefire deal under which surviving hostages could be released. We are not in the business of interpreting statements from foreign governments when and if they're made." "We do remain focused on freeing the hostages, including the remains of two Americans, and ensuring that Hamas never rules Gaza again," Bruce said.

Article: Eleven more die from malnutrition in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry says 5 minutes ago Share Save Emir Nader BBC News in Jerusalem Cachella Smith BBC News in London Share Save EPA Gazans carry aid packages from a food distribution point in Zikim in the northern Gaza Strip A further 11 deaths resulting from malnutrition have been reported in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Deaths continue to rise amid reports that a deadline of 7 October 2025 has been set for residents to evacuate Gaza City following the announcement of a controversial Israeli plan to take control of the area. The new plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet and detailed on Friday, lists five "principles" for ending the war in Gaza, with one being "taking security control of the territory". The plan has been met with criticism from world leaders as well as fierce opposition from some within Israel, including from military officials and the families of hostages still being held in Gaza who fear for their safety. The US has been less critical - with Donald Trump saying earlier in the week that it was "pretty much up to Israel" whether to fully occupy the Gaza Strip. Israeli media reports that the government has set a two-month deadline before a military siege of Gaza City to begin on 7 October 2025, the two-year anniversary of the beginning of the war. Within those two months, Israel plans to forcibly displace the estimated one million Palestinians living in Gaza City, roughly half the number of people living in the entirety of the territory. Many living there now have already been displaced multiple times through the war and are living in tents or the ruins of buildings that have been partially destroyed by Israeli air strikes. Israeli media reports that the military would move the population towards al-Mawasi, a vast tent encampment in the south of Gaza, already home to thousands of Palestinians suffering from an absence of basic facilities and sanitation. The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians have been killed seeking food since late May, when a new US and Israeli-backed organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) set up aid distribution sites.

District Court via AP) In this image from surveillance video obtained by the Louisiana State Police, Trooper Kasha Domingue confronts Clifton “Scotty” Dilley in Baton Rouge, La., early July 10, 2018. -- Louisiana authorities have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed from the waist down after a trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge and then falsely reported it as a Taser discharge. The settlement reached last month is among the largest of its kind in state history and resolves a federal lawsuit by Clifton “Scotty” Dilley, whose injuries confined him to a wheelchair when he was 19. The terms of the settlement, which were not made public, were provided to The Associated Press by a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to disclose them and spoke on condition of anonymity. State police fired Trooper Kasha Domingue after determining she shot Dilley “without any reliable justification,” failed to activate her body-worn camera and gave inconsistent accounts that were contradicted by surveillance video. Dilley said he hopes the “case will effect change within the state police that will keep this from ever happening again.” An attorney for Domingue, Louis Oubre, declined to comment, as did the state Attorney General's Office. Baton Rouge agreed in 2021 to pay $4.5 million to the children of Alton Sterling, a Black man whose fatal shooting by police was captured on video and sparked widespread anger and protests. One internal report said she “struggled from the onset of the class, both physically and mentally.” The Justice Department alluded to Domingue in its findings on the state police's widespread use of excessive force.

Article: "Companion animals, and especially cats, are 100% a public health risk in terms of the risk of zoonotic transmission to people," said virologist Angela Rasmussen, PhD, who studies disease progression in emerging viruses at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Veterinarian Jane Sykes, PhD, who specializes in infectious diseases in cats and dogs at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, said people should not assume it's bird flu if their cat is sick -- even if their animal spends time outdoors or eats a raw diet. The American Veterinary Medical Association says the risk of H5N1 spilling over from a pet to a person is "considered extremely low, but not zero." State and local public health agencies, including those in Los Angeles County and Washington state, have issued similar warnings against raw food diets for pets. Concerns for human health are partly why the FDA announced last month it is now requiring cat and dog food companies to update their safety plans to protect against bird flu. This came after the Oregon Department of Agriculture discovered a cat that was "strictly an indoor cat" had contracted H5N1 and died after consuming a frozen turkey product made by the raw pet food brand Northwest Naturals. It stated that "tests confirmed a genetic match between the virus in the raw and frozen pet food and the infected cat." Northwest Naturals voluntarily recalled that batch of its frozen turkey-based product. The company told KFF Health News and NPR that the recall involved "a small product run" and that it has concerns about the accuracy of the Oregon Agriculture Department's testing. Los Angeles County's public health department said five cats from two households tested positive for bird flu after drinking unpasteurized raw milk from the Raw Farm dairy in California's Central Valley. Raw Farm voluntarily recalled its milk and cream after retail products tested positive for H5N1, but it denies any food safety issues, calling the concern "a political issue." Veterinarians also warn pet owners not to allow cats unsupervised time outside as there's the risk of them getting H5N1 by interacting with other animals that might carry the disease. There isn't a lot of research on transmission of bird flu from companion animals like cats or dogs to humans, though Rasmussen agreed it's definitely a concern: The more infections you have in animals, "the more your luck is potentially going to run out." Most people who have caught H5N1 are agricultural workers who had direct contact with infected poultry or cattle. And the more people who catch H5N1, the more likely it would adapt to be more efficient, said Suresh Kuchipudi, PhD, MVSc, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, where he researches zoonotic diseases. Sometimes the results are benign, though it was likely a reassortment that involved an avian virus that led to the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people. That includes limiting a pet's exposure to H5N1 by not feeding them raw food or unpasteurized milk, and trying to keep them from interacting with animals like rodents and wild birds that could be infected with the virus.

"I felt like I just completely lost control of the situation." Kids typically have a different relationship with phones than adults do: They have a higher tendency to overuse social media and watch videos for hours on end, according to Michael Robb, head of research at Common Sense Media. This can cause problems with their sleep, physical and mental health, and shorten their attention spans — all making them less likely to develop into happy, successful adults, Yale University psychologist Laurie Santos told CNBC Make It in October 2023. Changing your habit means making a conscious effort — first to put your phone down when you've just picked it up, and then to avoid picking it up at all, Robbins said. "You cannot yell at your kids or expect your kids to police themselves [and] have balance if you're not modeling it." Specifically, Robbins stopped keeping her phone on her person after work, while walking around the house and while sleeping, she said. Maybe they were texting their friends, for example — theoretically a better use of technology than mindlessly scrolling through social media, which can damage your brain's "executive function," psychologist Gloria Mark said in April.

The crew of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov spent their time on the station conducting more than 200 science experiments that helped prepare humans for exploration beyond low-Earth orbit that included material studies and experiments to better understand physiological and psychological changes to the human body.

Article: Vance and Lammy host Ukraine talks ahead of US-Russia summit It is understood the meeting will take place at Chevening and was called at the request of the US Trump earlier signalled Ukraine may have to cede territory to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Zelensky has stressed he will make no territorial concessions to Russia ahead of a summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin next week to discuss the future of the war. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer had a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and said they agreed it would be a "vital forum to discuss progress towards securing a just and lasting peace". Saturday's meeting is understood to be taking place at Chevening, Lammy's official country residence in Kent, where Vance and his family are currently staying, and to have been called at the request of the US. Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Saturday that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier", and reiterated that Ukraine must be involved in any solution for peace. "We are ready, together with President Trump, together with all partners, to work for a real, and most importantly, lasting peace - a peace that will not collapse because of Moscow's wishes." This is what Ukraine, and many European allies, were always worried about - Trump and Putin trying to do a deal without Ukraine present. The BBC's US partner CBS News, citing a senior White House official, reported that it remains possible Zelensky, could end up being involved in the meeting between Putin and Trump some way, as planning for the Friday meeting is still fluid. But there is little evidence that Ukraine is willing to accept a peace at any price - much less one that will be forced on it without its voice being heard.

Article: President Donald Trump suggested a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories.” Zelenskyy said Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” WATCH: Trump suggests ‘swapping’ Ukraine and Russia territories ahead of meeting with Putin The remarks came after Trump said Friday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be nonnegotiable, and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine’s voice at the table. Ukrainian officials had previously told The Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine’s inability to regain lost territories militarily. The summit The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there’s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. “It seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement posted to the Kremlin’s news channel. WATCH: Trump will meet with Putin in Alaska for talks on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine In his comments to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump gave no details on the “swapping of territories.” Analysts, including some close to the Kremlin, have suggested that Russia could offer to give up territory it controls outside of the four regions it claims to have annexed. Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the AP that the “symbology” of holding the summit in Alaska was clear, and that the location “naturally favors Russia.” “It’s easy to imagine Putin making the point. … We once had this territory and we gave it to you, therefore Ukraine had this territory and now should give it to us,” he said, referring to the 1867 transaction known as the Alaska Purchase when Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million. “It may not be capitulation, but it would be a loss,” said Ihor Usatenko, a 67-year-old pensioner, who said he would consider ceding territory “on condition for compensation and, possibly, some reparations.” Anastasia Yemelianova, 31, said she was torn: “Honestly, I have two answers to that question. “But seeing all these deaths and knowing that my mother is now living in Nikopol under shelling and my father is fighting, I want all this to end as soon as possible.” Others, like Svitlana Dobrynska, whose son died fighting, rejected outright concessions but supported halting combat to save lives. “We don’t have the opportunity to launch an offensive to recapture our territories,” the 57-year-old pensioner said, “But to prevent people from dying, we can simply stop military operations, sign some kind of agreement, but not give up our territories.” Ultimatums and sanctions Exasperated that Putin did not heed his calls to stop bombing Ukrainian cities, Trump had moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. Russia and Ukraine trade attacks On Saturday, two people died and 16 were wounded when a Russian drone hit a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, regional Gov.

Article: It was our top stock, ending the week on a three-session winning streak that started Wednesday when Apple announced a $100 billion increase to the $500 billion it had already pledged to investing in the United States over the next four years. The president said, "If you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." While a temporary electronics exemption from earlier this year keeps Apple safe from the worst of the "reciprocal" tariffs that went into effect Thursday, there is no telling how long that exemption will last. With Trump off its back for now, the company must seize the opportunity to remove the other concerns about its stock by clarifying its artificial intelligence strategy and shoring up threats to its high-margin services business. As if that weren't enough, Eli Lilly stock took another leg down as strong earnings Thursday were overshadowed by lackluster weight loss results from the company's phase three trial looking at the effects of its obesity pill, orforglipron.

The Turkey international was expected to leave United this summer after losing out to Onana in the quest to feature in what turned out to be a Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. It will, at least, have done the 27-year-old's confidence some good to have turned away Fabiano Parisi's spot-kick - the only time either goalkeeper touched any of the 10 penalties - in a 5-4 shootout victory that followed Saturday's 1-1 draw.

Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/feds-bowman-jobs-report-rate-cuts.html
Article: The Federal Reserve's vice chair of supervision, Michelle Bowman, on Saturday said recent weak job data underscores her concerns about labor market fragility and strengthens her confidence in her own forecast that three interest-rate cuts will likely be appropriate this year. Most Fed officials have been more cautious about lower rates, given the potential they see that the Trump administration's tariffs could disrupt progress on getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% goal. "Taking action at last week's meeting would have proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a further weakening in economic activity," Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association. "My Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been consistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my view." The Fed has three remaining policy meetings scheduled for this year, in September, October and December. Economists typically point to 100,000 monthly job gains as being consistent with a steady-state labor market, though with big reductions in immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January that number is likely lower. Bowman repeated her longstanding view that large revisions make her cautious about taking too much of a signal from job-market reports, but on Saturday she said she sees "the latest news on economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the employment side of our dual mandate." She said recent inflation data has also boosted her confidence that the Trump administration's tariffs will not lead to persistent inflation. Excluding increases in goods prices related to tariffs, underlying inflation is "much closer" to the Fed's 2% target than the official reading of 2.8% in June, based on the 12-month change in the core personal consumption expenditures price index. Easing policy gradually from its current moderately restrictive stance would "reduce the chance that the Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further."

Protesters gathered Saturday morning in Yopougon, a densely populated suburb of the capital Abidjan, holding banners with messages such as: “Enough is enough!” and “No true democracy without true justice." Gbagbo and Thiam joined forces earlier this year to challenge incumbent President Alassane Ouattara. Seen as Ouattara's main rival, he has been barred from running on the grounds that he was still a French citizen at the time he declared his candidacy, even though he later renounced his French nationality. Over the past decade, groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have been spreading from the Sahel region into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Togo and Benin.

Article: LONDON (AP) — British police said they arrested more than 200 people in central London on Saturday as supporters of a recently banned pro-Palestinian group intentionally flouted the law as part of their effort to force the government to reconsider the ban. That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Daring police to arrest them More than 500 protesters filled the square outside the Houses of Parliament on Saturday, many daring police to arrest them by displaying signs reading “I oppose genocide. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. Why the group is being banned The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. Busy weekend of protests The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel's decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while little appeared to change immediately on the ground in the territory shattered by 22 months of war. Health officials said that 11 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead, and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours as the new criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food and other supplies to reach people in the besieged enclave. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Families of hostages were rallying again to pressure the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid new fears over the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. She called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel's decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation," endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel's decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel's plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. “This way is not for humans, it is for animals,” said one man at the scene, Mahmoud Hawila, who said he was stabbed while trying to secure an airdropped package. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn.

Article: Sturgeon denies 'conspiracy to destroy' mentor Salmond 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save Getty Images In her new memoir Nicola Sturgeon writes that she and Salmond formed "one of the most successful partnerships in modern British politics" Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to destroy her mentor Alex Salmond. In 2020 Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." The ex-SNP leader and Alba Party founder died of a heart attack in North Macedonia in October last year, aged 69. "It felt to me", writes Sturgeon, that Salmond "would have rather destroyed the SNP than see it succeed without him." She adds: "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy - government, police, Crown Office. "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all." In the memoir, entitled Frankly, Sturgeon describes the moment when Salmond first informed her of the allegations against him. Getty Images In March 2020, Salmond was cleared after a two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape At first, she says, Salmond had appeared "upset and mortified" and had "effectively admitted the substance of one of the complaints," calling it a "misunderstanding" for which he had apologised. However, Sturgeon goes on, it quickly became evident that her predecessor as first minister wanted her "to intervene and to stop the investigation in its tracks or divert it into some kind of siding." Her refusal to do so, she says, "made the break-up of one of the most successful partnerships in modern British politics all but inevitable." "I had to face the fact that he was determined to destroy me. "In Alex's narrative, he wasn't just a victim any more," writes Sturgeon, "he was now a vindicated victim." It later emerged that messages had been exchanged between women complainers - a Scots law term for someone alleging that they are a victim of crime - and also between SNP staff members. PA Media Alex Salmond led his party - and close colleagues John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Russell - into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 Rather, she said, the messages were between loyal supporters expressing "deep shock" and "women who considered themselves victims of his behaviour" who were "seeking support and comfort from each other." Sturgeon accuses Salmond of trying to "distort and weaponise" genuine shock or trauma in a way that was "truly disgraceful," adding "it strikes at the heart of why I find it so hard to forgive him". "It would then have required criminal collusion between them, senior ministers and civil servants, the police and the Crown." This, she says, was "a fabrication, the invention of a man who wasn't prepared to reflect honestly on his own conduct." Reflecting on Salmond's death, while attending a conference in the North Macedonian city of Ohrid, Sturgeon writes that the emotions she felt suggested she had not come to terms with their estrangement.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) FILE - Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, takes a seat for an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, in Washington, June 25, 2025. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move. At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that “the latest labor market data reinforce my view” that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs “will not present a persistent shock to inflation” and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. A fear is that Trump's tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called “stagflation,” where the economy stagnates but inflation is high.

The hosts were left to rue a top-order collapse to 55-6 - including Australia star Steve Smith falling for just three - as Bairstow was starved of the strike, facing just 18 of the first 50 balls of their pursuit of 164 to win. Chris Green contributed 32 not out from 21 balls in a stunning partnership of 100 from just 53 balls with Bairstow, who whacked six fours and six sixes in his destructive knock. The wicketkeeper had 28 from 27 balls before a remarkable acceleration that started with 21 runs scored from five balls of Wood, leaving the equation still an unlikely 70 off 30, which proved just enough for Spirit. Warner whacked eight fours and two sixes as he found support from England's Jamie Smith, who added 26 from 14 balls, while Warner's fellow Australian Ashton Turner chipped in with 24.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) YEREVAN, Armenia -- Residents and politicians in Armenia and Azerbaijan responded Saturday with cautious hope — and skepticism in some cases — after their leaders signed a U.S.-brokered agreement at the White House aimed at ending decades of hostilities. Among the agreement's provisions is the creation of a new transit corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” highlighting a changing geopolitical landscape amid declining Russian influence in the South Caucasus. Ali Karimli, head of the opposition People’s Front of Azerbaijan Party, wrote on Facebook that the signing of the agreement “has undoubtedly brought Azerbaijan and Armenia significantly closer to peace,” and noted that it delivered “another blow … to Russia’s influence in the South Caucasus,” while deepening ties with the U.S. Arif Hajili, chairman of Azerbaijani opposition party Musavat, said he believed that “the most positive aspect of the initialing in Washington was the absence of Russia from the process.” He said lasting stability in the region hinges on the continual dwindling of Russian power, which “depends on the outcome of the Russian‑Ukrainian war.” Hajili also warned of lingering challenges, including Armenia's economic dependence on Russia and some 2 million Azerbaijanis living in Russia. “Until now, all major routes have passed through Georgia, leaving Armenia sidelined and economically limited.” Others were skeptical that peace could be achieved, and expressed discontent with the terms of the agreement.

Miguel Uribe Turbay, who was shot in June during a campaign rally in Bogotá and remains hospitalized, experienced a hemorrhage in his nervous system and is once again in critical condition, authorities said Saturday. The Fundación Santa Fe clinic that is treating him said in a statement that Uribe Turbay required “urgent neurosurgical procedures” to stabilize him, adding that he was placed under deep sedation to aid his recovery. Two months after the attack, his wife, María Claudia Tarazona, posted the following message on Instagram: “My sweet love, I miss you so much that it tears my soul apart. Among those arrested is Cristian Camilo González Ardilla, alias “El Costeño,” whom authorities believe was the planner and organizer of the attack and considered key to help investigators track down its masterminds.

Article: Long before President Trump harnessed a working-class coalition to win last November’s election, leaders of the nation’s biggest labor unions, in public and private, were warning Democrats that those voters could defect. And if Democrats regain the ground they’ve lost with blue-collar voters, many of whom are union members, it could help leaders with their own struggles, including flagging membership and criticism that they are losing touch with everyday workers. Trump among blue-collar voters last year was the culmination of a trend in recent elections: Democrats gained votes in wealthy, white enclaves, while Republicans earned new support in working-class regions and among Hispanic and Black voters, raising questions about Democrats’ longstanding identity as the defender of working people. Union leaders, who mostly endorsed Kamala Harris even as many of their members scoffed at her candidacy, now find themselves trying to strike a delicate balance, maintaining support for Democratic candidates while not alienating members who voted for Mr.

Article: As someone who’s had another person’s kidney filtering my blood for more than five years, I don’t think I’ve been paranoid to worry that a health secretary so openly hostile to 20th-century medical innovations would eventually decide that people living happily after a transplant is a problem that warrants his solution. That’s why it was so frightening to read what Kennedy posted on X Monday: “Under my leadership, [the Department of Health and Human Services] is overhauling the organ transplant system,” he wrote. “We’ve exposed gross negligence, launched sweeping reforms, and will decertify any organization that violates the sanctity of human life.” Kennedy’s post and the news interviews and press release that preceded it focus on a horrible scandal involving Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates (which, after a merger, is now called Network for Hope) that was exposed last year. Over a four-year period, according to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, more than five dozen people who were on life support and not expected to recover nearly had their organs removed while they were still alive. The newspaper, quoting his medical records, said that as a medical team was preparing Hoover for organ retrieval in 2021, “he cried, pulled his knees to his chest and shook his head.” The newspaper said two former employees of the procurement organization said higher-ups in their organization pressured the doctor to proceed with the retrieval but that the doctor refused. “Network for Hope looks forward to working collaboratively with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and encourages the development of policies that support the betterment of the organ transplant system as a whole.” That same day, after a congressional hearing on organ procurement agencies, Massa released another statement: “We hold ourselves to the highest standards and are committed to ongoing improvement as we carry out the sacred responsibility of honoring each individual’s decision to become an organ donor.” The allegation that a procurement agency would push a doctor to remove organs from someone who was still viable is the stuff of nightmares. A press release issued by his office at the end of July calls out the offenses of “a major organ procurement organization” but doesn’t immediately point out that the scandal was specific to Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates. The first response I saw to Kennedy’s X post suggests that all such organs are improperly removed, that there are no cadaverous donors and that all organs come from people who are alive but medically immobilized. That’s absurd, but it’s no more absurd than Kennedy’s assertion that Black people’s immune systems are so strong we should be on a different vaccine schedule, his insistence that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS or his argument that Covid was “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and spare Jews and Chinese people.

Article: But based on what we know so far, the efforts would fail to address the real problems with the flow of aid into Gaza — and could provide political cover for Israel as it carries on with its assault on civilian life in the territory. Huckabee also said the sites would operate for longer periods of time; while sites in some cases have opened for mere minutes before announcing they’re out of food, Huckabee said that in the future they could operate for “as much as 24 hours a day.” This would be an incremental improvement, but akin to placing a Band-Aid on a gaping wound — while also stabbing the patient elsewhere. It reduced primary distribution of food to just four sites, and three out of its four initial sites are in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, making it hard for much of the population to access food. As I explained in a recent piece, GHF sites create a horrifying dilemma for Gazans by forcing them to choose between starving or risking being shot: Close to a thousand people have been shot and killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations. official to describe the new system.) Humanitarian and famine experts say that the program can’t possibly feed everyone in the territory and that it also ‘humiliates and undermines’ the population. But The New York Times, citing two senior Israeli military officials and two other Israelis involved in the matter, reported in July that “the Israeli military never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations” and that the U.N. (A White House spokesperson claimed no State Department official had seen the study and said it “was likely produced by a deep state operative.”) What we do know is that a surge in starvation-related deaths in Gaza came after Israel paused aid and instituted the GHF. Last week, Huckabee visited the Gaza Strip alongside Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and called GHF’s operations an “incredible feat.” Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News, “It was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military.” (NBC News also reported that “on the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid.”) The Trump administration is clearly willing to airbrush and downplay the harsh realities on the ground, which should give us reason to doubt that it’ll hold a high bar when trying to allow more food into the enclave. If the Trump administration were serious about helping Gaza, then it would pressure Israel to end a war that hundreds of ex-Israeli security officials have said no longer serves any military purpose against Hamas and call for an end to a blockade that treats civilians as targets of war.

Article: Among the many issues that have plagued the Internal Revenue Service in recent months is the revolving door at the commissioner’s office: Between January and May, the tax agency went through five different chiefs in five months. Exactly three weeks ago, Donald Trump — who picked Long despite his complete lack of qualifications — held a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for the Missouri Republican in the Oval Office. It was a provocative move in its own right: Since Watergate, presidents from both parties have taken a hands-off attitude toward the IRS, treating it as an apolitical and largely independent agency. The New York Times reported: President Trump is removing Billy Long from his job leading the Internal Revenue Service just two months after he was confirmed as commissioner, according to four people familiar with the matter. The Times’ report, which has been verified by NBC News, added that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — who ostensibly already has a full-time job — will serve as acting IRS commissioner for a while. For those keeping score, Senate Republicans confirmed Long on June 12, and he formally took the office on June 16, which means he lasted just 53 days — or in the parlance, roughly five Scaramuccis. What’s more, The New York Times reported late last year that Long has a problematic record of peddling a pandemic-era tax credit that the IRS warned was “a magnet for fraud.” Long’s record was so controversial that Senate Democrats suggested he face a criminal investigation. As for why the president, who's appeared eager to sic the IRS on his perceived political foes, decided to oust Long so quickly, the story is still coming into focus.

Article: Though gerrymandering is nearly as old as the United States, Trump is the first president to attempt a nationwide effort to secure his party control of the House by gerrymandering immediately before the election. In the context of the Congress and Supreme Court’s surrender to Trump and his record of election denial, this is best understood as an effort to secure what can only be characterized as autocratic control over all of American government. Kathy Hochul said the effort was “nothing less than a legal insurrection” and that “if Republicans are willing to rewrite the rules to give themselves an advantage, then they’re leaving us no choice. JB Pritzker has probably been the most aggressive of the Democratic governors supporting the Texas legislators, promising not only to house them but also to shield them from potential arrest by federal agents. It thus seems that the Texas gerrymander effort and the resulting flight of the state’s Democratic lawmakers may lead to a face-off between a Democratic-controlled state government, or several of them, and federal officials helping to indirectly carry out Trump’s gerrymandering directive. It is impossible to predict how all this will be resolved, but there is considerable reason to think these states will not abjectly surrender like congressional Republicans or the Roberts Court.

Article: Kathy Hochul are crafting plans to fight back against President Donald Trump’s push for a radical gerrymandering scheme in Texas, which would help rig the 2026 midterm elections in favor of the GOP. As The New York Times reported, Republican lawmakers released a draft map last week that “all but erased three urban Democratic seats and forced two other incumbents in South Texas into more Republican terrain.” Abbott called a special session of the Legislature to vote the map into law, but Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum and freeze the process. As UCLA law professor Richard Hasen wrote for MSNBC, this effort at an additional mid-decade gerrymandering effort is a naked power grab: “The Department of Justice sent a laughably weak letter to Texas claiming that the state had to redistrict because its earlier redistricting plans were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” he wrote. Here’s how that would work, according to NBC News: Newsom hopes to work with the Democratic-dominated Legislature starting this month to set up a special election for a statewide ballot measure on Nov. And as NBC News reports, “any new House map would be constrained by the Voting Rights Act, as well as the governor’s office and the Legislature, which would need to greenlight it.” Former California Gov. New York also has its own independent redistricting commission, and NBC News reports that “changing the redistricting process must move forward as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment — a lengthy and arduous exercise that probably wouldn’t lead to new congressional maps until the 2028 election cycle, even if Texas acts before the upcoming midterms.” Some other Democratic governors, including JB Pritzker of Illinois, haven’t ruled out their own retaliatory gerrymandering efforts. Democratic voters have been expressing sharp disapproval of their own party for its meekness in the face of Republican extremism, and clamoring for a party willing to fight more fiercely to protect democracy. And it’s not even clear that such efforts would be politically “necessary”: historical trends suggest Democrats could have a wave election in 2026, and, as Hasen notes, Texas’ redistricting ambitions could also backfire by diluting some Republican districts.

Article: On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he is ordering the Commerce Department to work on a new census that would exclude “persons who are illegally in our Country illegally.” It’s often difficult to know from a social media post what Trump intends. There, Democratic state legislators have fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum needed to adopt a new congressional map, with the intended effect to tilt the table slightly toward the GOP in what will most likely be a challenging 2026 election environment. And this is before Republican-allied organizations like business and law enforcement groups pressure Republican members of Congress to provide reliable population counts that would be jeopardized by the redirected resources needed to conduct a slap-dash census. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly states that congressional seats are to be apportioned by the “whole number of persons in each State.” Trump’s directive will be litigated, which poses yet another logistical barrier. If I were to guess what would happen, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will order the Census Bureau to explore adding a question to the 2030 census asking for people’s legal status in the country. In this scenario, the legal questions about using the data for apportionment and redistricting would be cans to be kicked down the road until the next president releases the population counts of the 2030 census. Advocacy groups representing immigrant communities would still most likely file lawsuits, though, alleging the addition of the status question negatively affects participation in the decennial census, thereby undermining the federal government’s Fourteenth Amendment mandate.

Article: His claim that these vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu“ represents a fundamental misunderstanding of vaccinology that could cost lives in future pandemics. According to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unvaccinated individuals had 53 times the risk of death compared to those who had been fully vaccinated during the Delta wave in 2021. A New England Journal of Medicine study analyzing over 6 million Covid cases found that protection against death remained above 90% and remarkably durable, even as protection against infection declined. As vaccine expert Paul Offit stated in December 2020: “All you want to do is keep people out of the hospital and keep them out of the morgue and I think this vaccine can certainly do that.” Even then, before vaccines were widely available, experts understood the real goal. The scientists who developed mRNA vaccine technology won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine for enabling “the development of effective mRNA vaccines against Covid-19” during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.

Article: 7 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.” Here’s a headline you might not have expected from the Los Angeles Times: “ICE arrests plummet in L.A., data show.” Over the past month, immigration arrests in the seven counties around Los Angeles have fallen to about half of what they were the previous month — and experts say there’s a simple reason for that. Last month, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop arresting suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their race, ethnicity, language and the type of work they do — otherwise known as racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security suggested that this raid was targeting MS-13 gang members, but, as the Times noted, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs. Local officials in Los Angeles have said Wednesday’s operation looks a lot like the kind of racial profiling raids that the courts explicitly told ICE they could no longer conduct in Southern California. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, questioned the federal government’s claim that the immigrants targeted in this raid were “gang members” and asked authorities to share any evidence they had to prove so. In a new court filing, they asked the Supreme Court to overturn that judge’s order and let them please go back to profiling as many brown, Spanish-speaking day laborers as they want. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” That is a pretty unbelievable statement.

(And yes, it is much anticipated by me, my siblings and my millennial cohort.) Lohan’s comedic timing, her magnetic chemistry with Curtis and the fact that everyone from the original cast has returned have all garnered buzz. For those somehow unfamiliar, the 2003 “Freaky Friday” centers on successful single mother and therapist Tess Coleman, played by Curtis, and her rebellious rock-'n'-roll-aspiring teenage daughter Anna, played by Lohan. I am not so naïvely suggesting that “Freakier Friday” was, you know, made for charity, but what I am pointing to is its deft understanding of why viewers loved the first one so much.

Article: District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong said the government can’t rely on the following factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence at a particular location, such as a bus stop, day laborer pickup area or agricultural site; or one’s type of work. Approving the factors laid out by Frimpong, the panel observed that apparent Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity has limited relevance in this context, because large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have such physical characteristics, especially in central California. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that “in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” Sauer complained that immigration agents can’t detain people based on those factors “even after encountering someone who speaks only Spanish and works as a day laborer at a worksite that has been cited 30 times for hiring illegal aliens as day laborers.” As the administration has done throughout President Donald Trump’s second term, Sauer casts the latest litigation as yet another instance of the justices needing to check their lower court colleagues. “When lower courts have tried to stymie other areas of immigration enforcement with unlawful, blunderbuss injunctions, this Court has not hesitated to stay those orders,” he wrote, citing recent examples of the high court siding with the administration (over dissent from Democratic-appointed justices). Against that backdrop, Sauer is pleading with the justices to free the administration from what he called the “straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.” How the court handles the request could indicate whether the justices agree with that dramatic framing, or whether they see that claimed confinement as a consequence of the Constitution rather than defiance of it.

Article: Three weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tried to discredit Donald Trump’s Russia scandal and started throwing around words like “treason,” the conspiratorial DNI has certainly succeeded in generating some conversation. On the one hand, Republicans and conservative media outlets have seized on Gabbard’s accusations as proof that the entire controversy surrounding the president and Russia’s efforts in support of his 2016 candidacy is a “hoax.” On the other hand, every independent analysis of Gabbard’s findings have pointed in the opposite direction: There was no “hoax”; the underlying scandal remains real; and the DNI’s claims are “ludicrous.” Officials from Democratic and Republican administrations urged the public to recognize Gabbard’s conspiracy theories as obvious nonsense, while intelligence officials launched a behind-the-scenes effort to discourage the DNI from even releasing her discredited claims in the first place. “What is that irrefutable evidence for our viewers tonight?” Gabbard responded by pointing to a National Security Council meeting, held in December 2016 — after Trump was elected and during the presidential transition process — that Obama called to discuss Russia’s operation. Not ‘if,’ but ‘how.’ And this was the beginning of this manufactured intelligence assessment where they knowingly wrote things in this assessment that were false, and they knew they were false. It was discussed in some detail in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee’s report, and as Media Matters’ Matt Gertz explained, the GOP-led panel didn’t find anything remarkable about Obama’s instructions. On the contrary, the committee reviewed the assessment that Obama sought and concluded that it was “coherent and well-constructed,” featuring “proper analytic tradecraft,” and that its authors experienced “no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.” But what about Gabbard’s claim that officials were told to put together an intelligence assessment that detailed “how,” not “if,” Russia targeted the election? Put another way, Gabbard appeared on Fox News — a network where she used to work as a paid contributor — and was asked to support her claims about “irrefutable” evidence. On the surface, it might not seem especially surprising that the national intelligence director has struggled to bolster her own baseless conspiracy theories, but let’s not forget that a great many Republican officials are heavily invested in the idea that Gabbard knows what she’s talking about.

Article: She always does.” Three months later, NBC News reported: Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. The probe is focused on whether James’ office caused a deprivation of legal rights under the color of law through its civil suits against Trump and his businesses as well as the National Rifle Association, these people said. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” In case anyone needs a refresher, it’s worth taking a moment to review how we arrived at this point. The civil case was rather devastating: The state attorney general’s office pointed to more than 200 instances of alleged fraud over 10 years, and announced that it was seeking civil penalties against the Republican and his business. On the contrary, in April, Trump’s federal housing director wrote a “criminal referral” letter about James to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, both of whom used to represent Trump. The news comes just days after Trump’s attorney general directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials, which came on the heels of news that the Trump administration had also launched criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, two longtime targets of the president. (Disclosure: Brennan is a paid contributor to MSNBC and NBC News.) Trump has also signed first-of-their-kind executive orders seeking investigations into two former officials — Christopher Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, a former high-ranking Department of Homeland Security official — whom he now sees as enemies. Weeks later, Trump broke new ground again by directing the Justice Department to launch a wide-ranging investigation into Joe Biden and officials in the Democrat’s administration, based on Republican conspiracy theories about the former president’s mental health. Two weeks ago, the official White House social media account published a weird item with just six words of text: “They came after the wrong man.” The sentence appeared alongside a large image featuring the words, “I was the hunted — NOW I’M THE HUNTER,” attributed to Trump. The New York Times, assessing Trump’s intensifying campaign of retribution, reported a couple of weeks ago, “This is what Washington thought retribution would look like.” The report added: Repeatedly in his first term, Mr.

Article: As if Donald Trump and his team hadn’t already targeted enough of the president’s perceived political foes, the Republican’s Justice Department has recently added to the list, launching an investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office — the same office that a brought a successful civil case against Trump and his family business. That the president and his team appear to be brazenly weaponizing federal law enforcement is a scandal unto itself, but in case the developments weren’t quite provocative enough, NBC News also reported: U.S. In May, Trump said the Missouri Republican would lead the Justice Department’s new “Weaponization Working Group” — tackling a problem that exists only in the minds of Republican conspiracy theorists — and serve as the DOJ’s new pardon attorney, succeeding Elizabeth Oyer, who was fired in March allegedly after she refused to sign off on a plan to restore actor Mel Gibson’s gun rights. A few days later, Martin announced at a press conference that he intended to use his new platform to “name” and “shame” individuals the Justice Department determines it cannot charge with crimes. According to Martin, his working group will take steps to smear these Americans publicly anyway — which, as an NBC News report noted, “would amount to a major departure from longstanding Justice Department protocols.” A month later, Martin declared that he’s also investigating Joe Biden’s clemency actions, pursuing a different Republican conspiracy theory. Now, evidently, Bondi has made Martin a “special attorney” (not to be confused with a special counsel) who’ll investigate at least two of the Democrats who’ve been repeatedly singled out by Trump. Trump, the future vice president said at the time, is “not a vengeful guy.” Shortly after the election, Trump appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and suggested vengeance wasn’t part of his plans for a second term. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said, adding, “Retribution will be through success.” The Republican president echoed the point during his second inaugural address, declaring, “Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents.” I have some bad news for anybody who believed any of these claims.

Article: As part of the incumbent president’s policy, there isn’t just a ban on transgender Americans volunteering to put their lives on the line for their country, there’s also an effort to identify transgender Americans who are already serving — and kick them out of the military. It’s against this backdrop that Reuters reported: The Air Force is denying early retirement to all transgender service members with between 15 and 18 years of military service, opting instead to force them out with no retirement benefits, according to a memo seen by Reuters. These longer-serving transgender service members will have the same choice as more junior ones: quit or be forced out, with corresponding lump-sum payments as they walk out the door, the August 4 memo says. In other words, there might very well be transgender service members who are thinking to themselves, “I'd prefer to keep serving, but if the Air Force no longer wants me because of my gender identity, I’ll just retire.” The Air Force is effectively responding, “If you retire, you’ll be eligible for retirement benefits, and we don’t want you to have them.” What’s more, according to Reuters’ report, many service members had already been approved for early retirement, but those approvals were rescinded. An Air Force spokesperson said that a subset of retirement applications were “prematurely approved.” Shannon Minter of the National Center for LGBTQ Rights told Reuters the developments are “devastating,” adding, “This is just betrayal of a direct commitment made to these service members.”

Article: However, Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has now scrapped that rule, announcing on Fox News that the agency has removed age barriers and will “no longer have a cap on how old you can be” to join. The agency is reportedly looking for a digital advertising company to “dominate” digital media channels, targeting Gen Z via ads on social media and streaming services like Hulu and HBO Max. (The phrase “your culture” is doing a lot of offensive work there.) The agency has even sent targeted emails to hundreds of local police officers and sheriff’s deputies across the country trying to poach them, a move that’s angering local law enforcement leaders in the process. Thanks to the more than $29 billion in funding for hiring and training from Trump’s spending bill, ICE is now offering up to $50,000 in a signing bonus for new recruits and up to $60,000 in student debt repayment. That means that while the Trump administration is trying to arrest, imprison and deport an unprecedented number of immigrants, there will be fewer and fewer immigration judges to hear their cases and decide whether their arrests were lawful.

Article: In one email from the Trump-Republican joint fundraising committee, Trump said, falsely, that he signed into law a measure for "no taxes on Social Security." Now, they're promising yet another imaginary benefit: tariff rebate checks. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that would give Americans a one-time $600 refundable credit on their income taxes next year — the same amount as the second round of stimulus checks during the coronavirus pandemic. (The checks would phase out for married couples making more than $150,000 a year.) Trump, who always knows a popular idea when he hears it — even if he has no intention of following through — quickly endorsed it, saying, "We're thinking about a little rebate." To be clear: This is not going to happen. First, if the tariff rebates were similar to the coronavirus stimulus, they'd cost the federal government about $164 billion, which is most of the money generated by the tariffs in the first six months of the year. There's little interest in even more new spending among Republicans in Congress, who passed a megabill earlier in July that is now estimated to cost $4.1 trillion over the next decade. Roger Marshall of Kansas said the money should be used to pay down the debt, instead, since Americans "don't feel like they're being hurt by tariffs." And while Trump said he liked the idea, he also called Hawley a "second-tier senator" around the same time, so it's doubtful that the two are going to work together anytime soon. But these ideas have a way of living on in the twilight areas of the internet, promoted by campaign emails that generate Google searches and lead to stories on local news sites thirsty for clicks, in a vicious cycle of misinformation. "Would you accept a tariff rebate check from President Trump?" Clicking either "yes" or "no" took me to the same website, where I could say whether I would like to receive anywhere from $600 (not happening) to $5,000 (definitely not happening) and whether I would invest it, save it, pay off debt, book a vacation or donate it to charity, before asking if I would like to donate to a Republican Senate candidate. The emails are an implicit admission that tariffs are raising prices for Americans, which is why Hawley had to go out of his way to claim that they are actually supposed to help people hurt by former President Joe Biden's policies, instead. For years, Republicans have attacked them for promising "goodies" to voters, which has led the party's establishment to avoid criticism by creating ever more elaborate programs, tax credits and subsidies when it wants to achieve some goal, like getting more people health insurance or fighting climate change.

Article: In his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” written in the midst of the Great Depression, the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that in times of economic crisis, the government could “fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again.” Such a plan might not be the most efficient way to create jobs and keep the economy afloat, Keynes conceded, but it “would be better than nothing.” While the American economy is certainly not in the throes of anything like the Great Depression, we do seem to have arrived at a banknote-burial scheme for the 21st century. The July jobs report showed an average of just 35,000 jobs created per month over the last three months, leading Trump to fire the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for reporting the bad news. It seems to be the thing that a lot of smart people are looking at very strongly, and our country will be prospering like never before.” While Silicon Valley is drowning in AI startups of all sizes, when it comes to capital investment most of the spending comes from the small number of giant companies known as “hyperscalers.” Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and a few others are investing spectacular amounts of money to build vast windowless boxes holding thousands of processing units. But massive corporations aren’t pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI as a public service — they think it will bring them even more fantastical riches in the future. This is the problem communities that have welcomed data centers have confronted: While billions are spent initially, which does provide work for construction workers, electricians and plumbers, those benefits are temporary. Every tech CEO may dream of the day their superintelligent AI product (likely making them the world’s first trillionaire), but the benefits to the rest of us are hazy at best. Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote, “It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable the creation and discovery of new things that aren’t imaginable today.” But in truth, it’s not so clear.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to open a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials in connection with their investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is the latest brazen political stunt by a Justice Department that has completely lost its moral compass. (Disclosure: My organization, Democracy Defenders Fund, has represented numerous former Justice Department lawyers and staff members targeted by the Trump administration over the past six months in other egregious circumstances.) Bondi’s decision stems from National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard’s absurd claim last month that Obama officials engaged in an attempted “coup” by manipulating intelligence assessments of Russian interference. Unsurprisingly in an administration in which the Justice Department and intelligence agencies subserviently do the president’s bidding, Gabbard’s claim predictably parrots an accusation Trump has raised since 2017: that Barack Obama colluded with the Russians. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation concluded Russian interference in the 2016 election was “sweeping and systematic,” leading to criminal charges against 34 people, including seven Americans and 26 Russians, and three Russian organizations. In 2020, a comprehensive investigation by a Republican-led Senate special committee found that the intelligence community investigation “presents a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference.” And during his first term, Trump’s Justice Department appointed a special counsel to investigate the investigators, who found nothing to discredit Mueller’s work and spectacularly failed to validate Trump’s dismissal of the Russia investigation as a hoax. Like the Mueller report, which lacked “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” America should have no confidence that these undeniable facts will be presented to the grand jury. Gabbard described her criminal referral to Justice Department as a “treasonous conspiracy.” In common usage, “treason” is often invoked to describe any devious act of betrayal against the democratic and constitutional values of our nation. More likely, Bondi will focus on crimes such as obstruction of justice or misuse of classified information, scrutinizing any of the countless, subjective decisions made by intelligence officials about how they gathered and evaluated evidence. Clement Stone famously said, “truth will always be truth, regardless of lack of understanding, disbelief, or ignorance.” Here, the obvious truth is that there was no “treasonous conspiracy” — just public servants doing their patriotic duty to decipher the extent of Russian interference in our democracy. That prompted the president to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after he called the economic data “rigged,” a move that drew opposition even from Republican senators.

Article: After Trump signed a bill clawing back $1 billion in funding, the nonprofit that supports PBS, NPR and more than 1,500 local public TV and radio stations around the country announced it will shut down by the start of next year. They can read The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post — plus the upcoming California Post — or The Daily Wire, The Federalist, the Daily Caller and Breitbart News. The conservative complaints about the news media date back decades to the days of three TV networks, when the evening news and daily newspapers set the nation’s agenda and anchors such as Walter Cronkite had tremendous sway. For example, long before Watergate dominated the headlines, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and affirmative action in government contracting, but never got his due from a skeptical press. He built a direct emotional connection not just with Republicans, but with millions of Democrats — the original “Reagan Democrats.” And in doing so, he exposed the limits of traditional media. One of the main selling points of radio commentators such as Rush Limbaugh was that he was a lonely voice in the liberal wilderness, helping connect everyone from truckers to commuters to families out for a drive in this new conservative community. It certainly explains the self-defeating decision by so many Republican members of Congress to shut down the CPB, which helps fund local radio and TV stations in rural areas they represent.

Article: “The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” Boasberg wrote in April, finding probable cause that government defendants had violated his order. That sentiment was echoed by the dissent on Friday, with Judge Cornelia Pillard backing her fellow Obama appointee in writing that the panel majority “does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.” Yet it was Boasberg who overstepped, according to the Trump-appointed judges in the majority, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao. While noting that the trial judge “was placed in an enormously difficult position” in dealing with fast-paced litigation, Katsas wrote that the government’s conduct “clearly and indisputably was not criminal.” Rao wrote that Boasberg “used the threat of criminal contempt to coerce the Executive Branch to comply with an order it had no authority to enforce.” Pillard closed her dissent by citing legal principles regarding obeying court orders and the fair administration of justice.

Article: August is the time of the summer when people start stocking away all those American flags put out for the Fourth of July celebrations and putting away the star-spangled outfits they carefully assembled this summer for Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour. Because the flag should be embraced and displayed more proudly than ever by liberal-leaning Americans who have generally conceded this core American symbol as something central to the right-wing conservative brand. Long before the Trump administration began its campaign of deportations, DEI attacks and direct assaults on women’s rights, LGBTQ progress and anything that smacked of pluralism, well-funded conservative groups, through signaling and symbolism, established an exclusionary notion of who constituted a “real” American. Well, that is unacceptable, and acknowledging that conservatives have, indeed, co-opted America’s most patriotic symbol is the first step in combating this exclusionary notion of who a so-called real American is. A CBS News poll conducted just ahead of the Fourth of July found that 91% of respondents who identified as Republicans say they “sometimes” or “often” fly the flag as a symbol of patriotism, compared with 64% of independents and 51% of Democrats. I wrote about this in a book I published last year called “Our Hidden Conversations, What American’s Really Think About Race & Identity,” based on my work at The Race Card Project, where I have collected hundreds of thousands of candid stories about race, identity, culture, privilege and belonging from hundreds of thousands of people from all corners of America. Many of those people talk about their place in America and whether they or their children will be “American enough,” not just based on paperwork or legal status, but based on the social norms that took root at this country’s founding and created a hierarchy based on skin color, lineage, immigration status and money. In her seminal book, ‘The White Album,’ Joan Didion said, ‘A place belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image.’” These words should speak loudly to us right now. That is one reason I so love the short documentary released last month called “Reclaim the Flag” from Alex Bittar and Bruce Cohen, who conduct bracing interviews with several leaders in the LGBTQ community about what the flag means to them in this moment. “When you walk past a house that has an American flag stoked up in the yard, your immediate thought about that person is — I’m not welcome here — that it’s a sign of bigotry and a sign of fear, and how sad is that?” said musician and actress, King Princess. Comedian Chris Klemens said, “I see someone hanging a flag and I’m like — you would hit with me with a car if you had the opportunity.” He was laughing when he said it. George Takei, the actor and activist who portrayed the helmsman Sulu on the USS Enterprise in the “Star Trek” TV series, describes learning about the flag as a young child in a forced incarceration camp/war relocation authority concentration camp where his Japanese American family was sent to live during World War II. The reason I advocate for this film and hope many will watch it on YouTube is that it culminates in the very hopeful message captured in its title: Reclaim the flag. You don’t have to reclaim what’s yours, darling.” When people start to let go of their rightful claim to the core symbol that should unite and encompass everyone, it makes it easier to snatch away a person’s stakeholder status. There is no reason that we can’t say that this symbol of America is our symbol too instead of feeling like this is a thing that we have run away from. It has to be a reclaiming by the whole population of those of us who believe in an open and liberal world.” That to me sounds like a good idea. I was raised by two postal workers who were oddly patriotic during my childhood when flying big flags and wearing flag emblazoned clothing were out of step with the “Say it Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)” culture of the ’60s and the ’70s. They were proud Black Americans who decided to love a country that didn’t love them back, and their point of view has come in handy as I tell my own adult children that you sometimes have to fight for a country that will most certainly break your heart.

Article: Elizabeth Warren’s remarks on CNBC’s "Squawk Box." Warren rightly called him out for failing to live up to his economic promises and raised concerns that he would install “some sycophant who’s going to give data that makes the president happy” as BLS commissioner. A multipost rant in which he called Warren a “LOSER!” and demanded CNBC “Call her out!!!” When the economy did not immediately collapse, Trump quickly declared victory — but it was short-lived. And the president faces another, more immediate problem: If he is planning to fire anyone who brings him bad economic news, he may soon run out of messengers to shoot. The stock market tanked and bond yields surged, prompting Trump to quickly walk back his most draconian measures, while still leaving overall tariffs at their highest level since the Great Depression. Last week’s personal consumption expenditures price index for June, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, increased by 2.6% compared to a year ago, with the “core” measure rising by even more.

Article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s recruitment push appears to have brought in at least one new high-profile agent: actor Dean Cain, best known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.” Cain, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, made the announcement Wednesday in a video posted to Instagram. In the Instagram video, the actor encouraged his followers to follow his lead and join the agency: “If you want to help save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America’s streets. I voted for that.” (CBS News reported at the end of June that, according to government figures, only 8% of those detained since Trump took office have a conviction for a violent crime.) “You can defend your homeland and get great benefits,” Cain said, listing new incentives rolled out by the administration as part of its push to recruit ICE officers, such as signing bonuses and what he referred to as “legal” student loan repayment. The agency has been desperately trying to boost recruitment to keep up with the administration's deportation goals, after Congress passed Trump’s spending bill, which allocated billions in funding for the hiring of 10,000 additional agents.

Article: Texas big game hunter killed while stalking African Cape buffalo toggle caption Denis Farrell/AP A Texas real estate magnate and trophy hunter was killed by a Cape buffalo during a hunting expedition in South Africa, according to a safari company, which described the incident as "sudden and unprovoked." Asher Watkins had been tracking the bull for a kill when the large horned animal staged an attack first. "Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers," said Hans Vermaak, leader of the safari company Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CVS), in a statement. He described Watkins and his family as "long-standing friends and part of the CVS family." Cape buffalo are considered one of the "most 'wanted' dangerous game animal by trophy hunters across the globe," according to the safari company. "Responsible for several deaths and many injuries to hunters each year, the buffalo is regarded as the most dangerous animal to pursue in Africa, let alone the world," CVS also said.

Gaza reached that point after Israel escalated its prior siege of the territory to block virtually all aid from March to May, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages still in Gaza. When Israel allowed aid back in, it did so mostly under a contentious new aid delivery system that resulted in the killings of hundreds of Palestinians and kept all but the strongest and luckiest from getting food. Now Israel is pausing the fighting in some parts of Gaza each day to help aid convoys move, approving some imported food for sale in Gaza and allowing aid to be airdropped.

That followed his announcement on Thursday that Israel would finally defeat Hamas by occupying all of Gaza and then handing it to “Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us.” This latest endeavor, which may take weeks to begin, risks ending the same way as all his previous efforts: in a strategic dead-end, with Hamas still holding on by its fingertips, Israeli hostages still in Hamas’s grip, and Palestinian civilians trapped in a dystopian nightmare. Israel captured much of Gaza City in the first months of war, seizing some areas more than once, before relinquishing it all on the false assumption that Hamas had been defeated.

A mature Cape buffalo bull can weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, the company’s website says, cautioning that it is not unusual for buffaloes to charge hunters without provocation and that “no species on the planet has a more fearsome reputation.” The aggressive temperament of the Cape buffalo has earned it a nickname: black death. “Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers,” Hans Vermaak, whose family runs the safari company, said in a statement.

Eleanor Olszewski, Canada’s emergency management minister, announced on social media Thursday morning that the armed forces and the Coast Guard would assist the island province of Newfoundland in fighting blazes. About 7.1 million hectares, or 27,000 square miles, of forest have burned so far this season in the country, spreading smoke through parts of Ontario and Quebec, the most populous provinces, and down into the eastern United States, although not with the same intensity as two years ago.

He said that Israel did not want to permanently control the territory, and that Israel hoped to eventually hand over control to unspecified “Arab forces.” Israel is facing increasing international pressure, including from longtime allies, to end the nearly two-year war in Gaza and to do more to address the hunger crisis in the enclave.

Some South African officials say they have no intention of backing down on efforts to address the economic disparities that remain three decades after the end of white minority rule.

He doubled already hefty tariffs on Indian exports to the United States for its steadfast refusal to stop buying oil from Russia, in an effort to pressure Russia to end the war. Trump has accused India of helping Russia finance its war on Ukraine through oil purchases; India has said it needs cheap oil to meet the energy needs of its fast-growing economy. India called the additional tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” pointing out that it was being punished for doing something — buying Russian oil at a discounted price — that other nations have done, although it didn’t mention names. China is the largest buyer of Russian oil, and Turkey has also deepened its energy links with Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, without incurring similar penalties.

The fragments making up the krater that was returned passed through the hands of three dealers including Robin Symes, who died in 2023 and was long suspected by investigators of being involved in trafficking. (Loan agreements have become a tool for museums looking to hold on to important items at a time when many countries are seeking the return of their cultural heritage.) In recent years, the Met and other museums have faced increasing scrutiny from law enforcement officials, academics and the news media over the degree to which their collections include looted artifacts. After a number of high-profile seizures from the Met, it announced in 2023 a new research effort to investigate its holdings with the intention of returning items that it determines to have problematic provenance. The 34 objects that were recovered by the district attorney’s Antiquities Trafficking Unit and returned include two harness pendants dating to the sixth century that were seized from the Met and repatriated to Spain; the objects sent back to Italy included two sculptures that were most likely created in Egypt before being brought to Italy during Rome’s occupation of Egypt.

French leaders going back to Charles de Gaulle, he said, had called for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on “the recognition by each of the states involved of all the others.” Neither man mentioned the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the secret treaty between Britain and France in 1916, under which the European colonial powers carved up the Levantine territories of the crumbling Ottoman Empire into spheres of British and French control. Sykes-Picot is cited by historians as an enduring example of Western imperial arrogance — a cynical exercise in drawing borders that cut across religious, ethnic and tribal communities in what are today Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories.

The two sides have been working to resolve their differences in recent weeks, but a court motion filed by the government on Friday in a dispute over international students suggested there is still deep acrimony. The motion accuses Harvard of failure to control crime, and claims that Harvard’s leadership has “shown itself to be incapable of properly hosting, monitoring, disciplining, and reporting on its foreign students.” On the same day, Commerce Secretary Howard W. President Trump issued a directive that would require colleges and universities to submit reams of new data on students to check whether they are complying with a Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action.

Lawyers from the free speech group, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, brought the lawsuit on behalf of the student newspaper at Stanford University, The Stanford Daily, arguing that several of its staff members have been forced to self-censor or quit the paper out of fear that the government could retaliate for what it publishes.

That aspect of the agreements with Columbia and Brown, which goes well beyond the information typically provided to the government, was largely overlooked amid splashier news that the universities had promised to pay tens of millions of dollars to settle claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws, including accusations that they had tolerated antisemitism.

Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled against the administration in a case brought by the Authors Guild, saying that the cancellation of already approved funding for 1,400 research projects violated the First Amendment. In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked.

So on Thursday, Switzerland found itself in the uncomfortable position of facing a 39 percent tariff on its goods in the United States, one of the highest rates in the world. Guy Parmelin, the Swiss economy minister, said at the conference that the country’s industries would be hit hard by the high tariff rate as well as the uncertainty over when and whether it might be reduced. will be effectively annihilated.” The crisis has reignited a longstanding debate in Switzerland over whether to remain independent from the European Union, which faces a 15 percent tariff as part of a deal with Mr. Switzerland already took a step in that direction in June, when the government approved a package agreed upon with the European Union to streamline their trade ties after a decade of thorny negotiations. Georges Kern, the chief executive of the luxury Swiss watch brand Breitling, said in an interview that the company had enough inventory in the United States to last roughly three months. Kern hoped for a trade agreement in the coming weeks, and said Swiss companies “can and will contribute to find a solution with President Trump to address his concerns.” Image During talks with American officials, the Swiss highlighted the major investments that their companies had made in the United States, including the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis. Sedat Suna/Getty Images Pierre-Yves Bonvin, the chief executive Steiger Textil, a Swiss company that makes industrial knitting machines, described the tariffs as a “tsunami.” Swiss businesses had been led by the government to believe that they would face a top tariff of 15 percent, he said, which they could have managed. A Swiss maker of precision cutting tools said his company would start layoffs almost immediately for its small American work force of 10 people because it could not afford to absorb the 39 percent tariff, nor pass the whole price increase onto its American manufacturing customers. The dimming prospects for business in the United States also drove the decision, according to the company’s chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation by Mr. Officials thought they had made a convincing case to their American counterparts to reduce an initial 31 percent tariff threat by highlighting the major investments that Swiss companies have made in the United States, including by the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis.

Skydance is controlled by David Ellison, a movie producer and the founder of the company who is the son of Larry Ellison, the tech titan and one of the world’s richest men.

Article: Senior officials in Southeast Asia say the United States is setting its criteria for so-called rules of origin unilaterally to define what constitutes a locally made product, based on a calculation that involves raw materials, overhead productions and the cost of labor. “We explained to them that, if they put a very high percentage, we will not qualify, because we don’t have our upstream industry yet, so we need to improve and diversify our supply chains,” said Sun Chanthol, Cambodia’s deputy prime minister and lead trade negotiator. “As long as we can have the grace period to do that, we should be OK, but if they put it on Day 1, then we will face difficulty.” Since Mr. Trump’s first presidential term, many multinational companies have shifted their manufacturing to Southeast Asia in a bid to diversify their supply chains and reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing, particularly in response to escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. Now, the Trump administration appears to be floating numbers to see what governments would accept on the “rules of origin.” One such proposal to Thailand recently was whether 70 percent locally made was attainable, according to a senior Thai official involved in trade talks with the United States.

Article: The trilogy recounts how a motley group of friends set out on a journey to destroy the great Ring of Power and defeat the dark Lord Sauron, who intends to use its dreadful magic to rule all of Middle-earth through “force and fear.” The Ring corrupts all who use it, and its story endures as a potent allegory about the corrupting effects of greed and pride and what Tolkien called the evil “lust for domination.” Given the trilogy’s idealistic overtones, it’s easy to understand why the books gained a cult following in the 1970s among hippies and Vietnam War protesters, who embraced its love of nature and rejection of consumer culture, and what they saw as its passionate denunciation of militarism and power politics. It’s more difficult to understand why the trilogy’s most prominent fans today are Silicon Valley tech lords like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and a rising group of far-right politicians in both Europe and the United States. Why do so many of today’s high-profile fans of “The Lord of the Rings” and other fantasy and sci-fi classics insist on turning these cautionary tales into aspirational road maps for mastering the universe? Some of the answers lie in the sheer popularity of the trilogy, which has sold more than 150 million copies across the world and permeated the public imagination, as genre fiction has moved from the margins to the mainstream.

And I think for a lot of people, this is going to be their first experience with a reasoning model because OpenAI does not make that the default right now in ChatGPT. On the other hand, I do feel like it sets up an incentive for OpenAI, which wants to save as much money as it can to just always try to route you to the absolute least compute that you need. And so I will just be curious to see if I feel like that is affecting the quality of my experience now that maybe can’t go in and actually say, hey, let me use the good stuff. And that might be a good point to bring up two of the questions that got asked of the GPT-5 team during the briefing that were on the — that I think would be of interest to our listeners. I mean, I wonder if they are starting to finesse their definitions of the scaling laws to account for the new reasoning models because people, for months now, have been saying, well, the models in the pre-training phase may have gotten as good as they’re going to get or about as good as they’re going to get. And all of the labs have had experiences where they thought they were training a new model and then it didn’t quite work out as well as they wanted it to and so they assign it some lower number, that’s happened at least a number of big labs that I know about. To me, that is one of the most interesting things about this release is whatever GPT-5 turns out to be, this is the thing that they thought was the next big step forward. And I think it was reasonable to expect, and I certainly expected that in the wake of all that, they would slow down and maybe allow some competitors to catch up. And I think one thing I’ll have my eye on over the next several months is, are they able to continue iterating very quickly or have some of the losses that they’ve experienced over the past few weeks really hurt them? And I think in particular, if you are a free user of ChatGPT, you’re going to have a great day because for the first time now, in addition to standard ChatGPT model, you’re going to have some reasoning capability. I mean, the way I saw people talking about it online was that they thought that OpenAI had not raised the ceiling of the AI frontier by a lot with GPT-5, but they had raised the floor, essentially. What makes that figure interesting, I think, Kevin, is that that number is a lot smaller than Anthropic’s Claude for Opus API, which comes in at $15 per million input tokens. So I think some of these really well capitalized AI labs are taking this moment to say, hey, we’re going to put a lot of pricing pressure on some of our competitors. In fact, some people are posting online screenshots of some prediction markets that until today, when asked, who do you think will have the most powerful AI model at the end of August, were showing OpenAI in the lead. So I don’t want to overstate what that means necessarily, but it does seem like there was a huge contingent of people who thought that GPT-5 was going to be this revolutionary new model. One of them is that The New York Times Company has recently agreed to a licensing deal with Amazon that will allow Amazon access to “Times” content for its AI platforms, including Alexa. The second thing we should say is that if you have an Alexa device, it is going to be going off constantly during this segment, unless you go over right now and hit the little button that mutes it. And I use zero of them because the three things that I use Alexa for are setting timers, choosing music to play in my house, and telling me the weather before I leave for the day. But when generative AI started to get good a couple years ago, I think people naturally started to ask, well, when is Alexa going to start using this new generative AI technology? But it seemed like a natural thing to expect that Alexa would start to incorporate some of this technology to be able to answer maybe more open-ended questions, to give longer, more detailed responses, to do more than just set timers and tell you the weather. I mean, once OpenAI released voice mode for ChatGPT, it just immediately seemed so much more interesting and powerful than Alexa and Siri, which is Apple’s very similar system that it makes for its devices. And so yeah, I think both of us were like, OK, well, when are we going to get that OpenAI style voice mode in these smart devices that we have in our homes? And part of what I’m so excited to talk with Daniel Rausch, the VP of Alexa, about later in this show, is just why it’s been so hard to shove an LLM-based generative AI technology into this pre-existing assistant product. But we should just talk briefly about what Alexa+ is and then our experiences with it because both you and I have gotten to try this over the past few days. We don’t know exactly which model or models, but it seems to be a mix of Amazon’s proprietary AI models and then maybe some of Claude, which it has a deal with Anthropic. The other big difference I noticed right away is that the new Alexa+ does not require you to say the wake word, like Alexa, between every question and answer pair. And then you can just say, order me an Uber from this place to this place, or I want a table at a restaurant in downtown San Francisco near the Ferry Building for two people at 6:30 tomorrow. And it was just this forever — and so I eventually just unplugged the thing because I was like, why did I just spend $90 to have a permanent rotating advertisement for household products on my desk? Now, there are a lot of things I’m willing to do for a podcast, but mount an Echo Show on my wall — kevin roose You’re not willing to do a construction project. And it’s like, this — and right here, we have just landed in the exact spot that has been bedeviling Apple for the last year, that is bedeviling Alexa right now. And after two days of ads for paper towels and one day of I’m not going to show you the lemon pasta, I thought, what am I doing with my life? kevin roose So the new Alexa+ update seems to have broken Alexa’s ability to reliably set and cancel alarms, which is a core thing that I use this product for. And so for example, this morning, I woke up on my own a little bit earlier than my alarm, like, 10 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off. And one of the things it said was, I can help you explore Gen Z music trends, which there was just something funny about the way it said it to me. But now you’re trying to sell me Amazon Music, which I feel like is very consistent with how Alexa+ handles everything, which is, could we sell you a service right now? Two, I’m very confident that lots of other people are probably having much better experiences with this thing because I think if most people were having experiences as bad as me, I just would have heard about this before now. But I think my overall impression is that the Alexa+ that you have now in this early access program, it is a little like having a kind of GPT-3.5 class model inside of a smart speaker, which I think is a valuable thing and one that I would like them to continue to build on. casey newton I think the most powerful thing that the Alexa+ has done for me is it has made me forgive Apple for not shipping anything with the new Siri. I think what’s happening with Alexa and Siri right now is sort of a — it’s like a symbol of what’s happening in the American economy writ large, which is we are trying to jam these new AI technologies into these legacy systems and processes. I also just think that when I’m using a chatbot on my laptop and it gives me something that’s 80 percent or 85 percent right, that’s much more useful to me than an Alexa response that’s 85 percent right because a chatbot setting, I can just take what I need. But really, it’s a complete re-architecture of everything that you would say Alexa is from the way you have a conversation and engage with the experience at a very basic level all the way through Alexa acknowledging you or just maintaining a chat. I think it’s fair to say we both had some things that impressed us about the new Alexa+ and some things that were challenging, including some of the basic stuff that Alexa seemed to be very good at before, or at least that I know how to get reliable performance out of Alexa for that no longer seem to work as well. Because back in 2023, when Amazon announced that it was going to revamp Alexa, give it this brain upgrade with these new AI capabilities, they said this was going to be ready in 2024. If you go back to 2023 and the models that were available then, the state of the art, very little instruction following reasoning, low ability to execute on these interfaces with other systems, we announced something called Let’s Chat, which was a mode of Alexa. So think about flipping a switch on Alexa and turning on a chat interface so that you can do some basic question and answer and have a discussion about a topic, mostly about knowledge native to the model’s training data versus bringing something in at runtime the way that modern chatbots answer questions by going out on the internet. I think as all of us know, you sit there and fiddle with a chatbot long enough to press it into being smarmy or responding in ways that we don’t believe are the way Alexa might act, for example, or press it to give you wrong information that’s from some unauthoritative source or a mistake in its training data online, shifts back to its native training. Personalizing an experience of this depth so that Alexa is always learning from her interactions with you and extending your interactions so they get more delightful over time, I think this is something you probably wouldn’t have seen in a weekend’s worth of fiddling with the experience. And I think if you rewind the tape to 2023, it’s really about learning how big a project Alexa+ would be and then starting to put one foot in front of the other, really inventing the space of creating those integrations because it just hasn’t been done. But the amount of work that went into just the interface between a large language model and the downstream systems that complete tasks is — I mean, it’s the biggest body of work that we’ve put in. And it would be too much to even try — without a whiteboard here, it would be too much to even try to explain to you and your listeners, I think, the technical depth that went into it. There was a former machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, Mihail Eric, who did a long post on X last year, sort of his version of a postmortem or retrospective on what was happening with Alexa. And he wrote that Amazon had, quote, “all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.” But then he said that Amazon and Alexa had fumbled the ball because Alexa was, quote, “riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.” He made it seem like the problem was not just that the technology was an uneasy fit, but that there were also some organizational and bureaucracy problems that had to be solved. But I do think the team is inspired by the vision, executing at an unbelievable pace and really creating a lot of invention because there are a lot of really hard problems. This is a company that has offered a lot of AI models through AWS, big market share in cloud-based AI, also recently started an AGI lab at Amazon that is going to be pushing towards something like an artificial general intelligence. daniel rausch I would say we do believe — and I share this belief, the leadership team at Amazon has, that this generation of generative AI is going to transform every customer experience we have. So if you look at the scale and scope of what Amazon does and assume our belief that every experience will be transformed with generative AI, it’s as big as Amazon is at that point. To be as productive as you can be in this day and age and get as much done for customers as we aspire to, you have to build AI into how you’re working. On the 5, my first observation was that after I told it I would like to see art, I feel like every time I looked over at it, it was asking me if I wanted to buy paper towels or Advil something. But I felt like the Alexa+ AI thinks of me primarily as a person who might send more money to Amazon if you just gave me a few more ideas for how I might do that. But I do think it comes across as a kind of insecurity in the device like, if we’re not constantly showing you everything that we’ve built into this thing, you’ll never discover it. One of my most delightful — we have a new LLM called For You, which is a place where we post little notifications about things we think you might be interested in. And I had been helping my daughter study the periodic table for part of her chemistry final, and I was never great at remembering, in particular, the elements that you need a mnemonic for, like lead. kevin roose To piggyback on Casey’s question, I think this is one of the big questions about the Alexa business model is whether you see this as something that is going to make money on its own or whether this is primarily a way of increasing the amount of money that people spend on Amazon. And putting it into Prime brings together both all of a customers’ Prime benefits because you might watch a video, or listen to a song from Amazon Music, or use your Amazon Photos benefit, which is awesome with an Echo Show and review your family photos. So some of the more complicated stuff that I tried with Alexa+, such as setting up routines that involve multiple steps such as emailing documents or research papers to the Alexa email address and trying to have it summarize these things, these things just didn’t work for me. What I found more frustrating that I wanted to ask you about, because I’m actually not sure why this happens, was that some of the basic features that Alexa had previously been good at and reliable at for me were less reliable with Alexa+.

Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/podcasts/the-daily/epa-trump-climate-change.html
Article: This is “The Daily.” After rolling back a slew of regulations aimed at reversing climate change and pulling funding for the scientists who monitor it, the Trump administration is now taking its boldest action yet. On Tuesday, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, traveled to Indianapolis to a truck dealership to make what he called one of the most significant acts of deregulation in American history. But the endangerment finding is the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases in the United States, from automobiles, from power plants, from oil and gas wells, and more. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Massachusetts versus EPA that greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, others are pollutants and that the EPA can regulate them if they pose a danger to human health and welfare. And taking you back to that time, 2008, the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top scientific body, had just recently established the most comprehensive set of information to that date on establishing that climate change is caused by human activities and the dangers that it poses. It went through findings that US scientists under the Bush administration had compiled about the threats of climate change, everything from the way that increased and more intense wildfires and the smoke from wildfires affects human health to the increases in regional ozone pollution that are exacerbated by climate change. And based on this evidence, the Obama administration determined pretty conclusively see that climate change and the emissions that are furthering climate change cause a danger to human health and welfare. [APPLAUSE] lisa friedman That was an effort to reduce emissions from the utility sector, from power plants in the United States, reducing methane from leaks from oil and gas wells, restrictions on automobile tailpipe emissions. And we and others reported that the EPA at that time made the decision that it was not a legal fight that it could win, and it wasn’t a science fight that they felt they could win. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Interestingly, and I think this dynamic still holds, the business community that back in 2009 had been so worried about the endangerment finding by 2016 had really lost an appetite for fighting it. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Lisa, before President Trump returns to office this year and targets this endangerment finding, in the middle of his two terms, of course, we have President Biden, who, it seems worth briefly mentioning, makes regulating climate change a very big priority and gets a lot done on that front. And so the Biden presidency feels like a reinforcement of this idea that the overall arc of where the United States is going is this journey toward regulating emissions and trying to use the government to reduce them. Because through the course of Obama, Trump, and Biden, as much as the first Trump administration promoted fossil fuels, weakened regulations, they never attacked this fundamental understanding, which, like you said, has really become, by this stage, kind of embedded — that climate change is real. But the EPA is making a series of arguments and alternative arguments, what one legal scholar described to me as throwing a bunch of spaghetti to see what sticks with a court. One other thing they argue is that even if the endangerment finding stayed in place, they’re saying that the EPA shouldn’t set standards on greenhouse gas emissions because no matter what technology we apply, we can’t make a dent in the problem of global climate change. michael barbaro Putting aside those legal arguments, I’m curious why, in your reporting, you have found that the White House has decided to go after a finding that, as you have explained very clearly in this conversation, the industry doesn’t really want anymore. And so what Trump is doing in moving to repeal this is really satisfying a request to pull, root and stem, the ability to regulate climate change from the government. michael barbaro It feels, upon reflection, like getting rid of the endangerment finding bookends two very different moments in the climate change conversation in the United States — when it was created back in the Obama presidency and now that it’s coming down. But I think you still see that the majority of Americans — and the Pew polls and others show this — acknowledge climate change, are concerned about climate change, and want the government to take some kind of action — that there is a lot of dispute about. lisa friedman I think when the dust clears on this legal fight — and there will be a big legal fight after the repeal of the endangerment is finalized — I think the question is going to come back to Congress. michael barbaro Not which executive actions stay or get removed and toggle back and forth, but whether the legislative branch ever decides that this is something that it wants to tackle. When Congress failed to pass a big climate law — at the time, it was called cap and trade — he gave a speech where he said, if Congress doesn’t act, I will.

Article: Trump signed into law this month includes about $18 billion in new and expanded tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which analyzes tax policy for Congress. It reduces the amount of money that energy companies must pay the federal government for the oil and gas they extract on public lands and waters, a change valued at about $6 billion, according to one analysis. The bill also delays penalties for oil companies that fail to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that leaks from wells, representing about $1.5 billion in benefits for the industry, the Congressional Budget Office found.

Article: michael barbaro I think we’re going to call — yeah, I think we’re going to call you back on a — for the first time in a really long time — a landline. This is “The Daily.” Today’s total solar eclipse will be watched by millions of people across North America, none of them as closely as Fred Espenak, a longtime NASA scientist who’s devoted his entire life to studying, chasing, and popularizing the wonder that is an eclipse. And I made a promise to myself that I was going to get to that eclipse in 1970 to see it because I thought it was a one chance in a lifetime to see a total eclipse of the sun. And I was amazed that outside the back of the motel, in this grassy field, there were dozens and dozens of people with telescopes out there, specifically there for the eclipse that morning. It’s really only in the last 10 minutes or so that you start to notice changes in the environment because now enough of the sun has been covered, upwards of maybe 90 percent of the sun. fred espenak Well, I think, when you see this all transpire, you can easily understand how people thought this was the end of the world because it seems far outside of the realms of nature. You almost get a three-dimensional sense of the motions of the Earth and the moon around the sun when you see this clockwork displayed right in front of you, this mechanics of the eclipse taking place. And I realized, well, I’ve got to expand my outlook on what’s an acceptable distance to travel to see a total eclipse because the next total eclipse then, in 1973, was through the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. michael barbaro And if you’ll permit me a question that might seem maybe dopey to someone in your field, after you’ve seen one or two or three of these, do they start to blend in together and become a little bit the same? fred espenak So I went to grad school at University of Toledo and did some work at Kitt Peak National Observatory, learning the ins and outs of photometric photometry — that is, measuring the brightness of stars. fred espenak Well, I’ve seen total eclipses from Australia, from Africa, from the Altiplanos in Bolivia, from the ice sheet on the coast of Antarctica, and even from Northern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. [bonnie tyler, "total eclipse of the heart"] Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart fred espenak Of course, we had “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” It was a must-have. fred espenak Well, the eclipses are like benchmarks that I can use to figure out what else was going on in my life during these times, because I remember the dates of every single eclipse I’ve been to. It reminds me of when Pat and I got married and between which eclipse we were getting married and had to plan our wedding so it didn’t interfere with any kind of eclipse trips. But I think, for the rest of us — and here, I’m thinking about myself — this is really going to be my first total eclipse, at least that I can remember. And given the hard-earned wisdom that you’ve accumulated in all your decades of chasing eclipses around the world, I wonder if you can give us just a little bit of advice for how to best live inside this very brief window of a total solar eclipse, to make sure, not to be cliche, but that we make it count. fred espenak Well, I think one mistake that people tend to make is getting preoccupied with recording everything in their lives, what they had for lunch, what they had for dinner.

Coming to terms with his loss will be painful in training and in matches, with his absence felt in ways far beyond the gap the Portuguese forward leaves in the starting XI each week. Arsenal Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal have been the form team of the last three seasons in the Premier League, but three second-place finishes in a row are starting to burn deeply in north London. Enzo Maresca’s side stormed to a 3-0 win against the Parisians, who swept through the UEFA Champions League – culminating in their own 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan – to complete the treble. Whether Maresca can continue to tie the team together following the CWC triumph, and whether that tournament will test the legs of the Blues players later in the season, could well be deciding factors in Chelsea’s title challenge. Or will the light blues of Manchester continue to feel the heavy burden of a side that conquered all before them, only to seemingly lose control of their own success last season? The injury to Ballon d’Or holder Rodri undoubtedly hit City hard last term, and the news that he will miss the start of the new campaign will also come as a huge concern to Guardiola. For a team that won an unprecedented five trophies in 2023, and the record-setting Premier League title the following year, to fall so far last season came as a huge shock to all, not least their manager. The Blues also crashed out of the Champions League and League Cup early, and their FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace meant no silverware for the first time in eight years. The summer spree pushed City’s spending for 2025 past the 300-million-pounds ($403.5m) mark, following the arrivals of Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico Gonzalez and Vitor Reis in the January window. We want to try and do better than last season, especially with consistency.” A cloud that continues to hang over the club, however, is that they still face 115 charges of breaking Premier League financial regulations. Manchester United and the rest United have defied their financial woes to reinvent their front three with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo signed earlier in the window, and the big-money move for Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Just like Guardiola, his opposite number across the Manchester divide, how long the reversal in fortunes takes is likely to take will define how much longer Amorim has at the helm. Aston Villa were another side that have threatened to break into the Premier League’s elite, having secured Champions League football two years ago, which resulted in a run to the quarterfinals last year. If the transfer merry-go-round continues, however, then Villa striker Ollie Watkins could be the next on the move, with all of last season’s top four having been linked with a move for the England international at some stage.

Article: Iran has said it will block a corridor planned in the Caucasus under a United States-brokered peace accord between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which has been hailed by other countries in the region as beneficial for achieving lasting peace. Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Saturday that Tehran would block the initiative “with or without Russia”, with which Iran has a strategic alliance alongside Armenia. US President Donald Trump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News, referring to the transport corridor included in the peace deal. The terms of the accord, which was unveiled at a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday, include exclusive US development rights to a route through Armenia that would link Azerbaijan to Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave that borders Baku’s ally Turkiye. Advertisement While it welcomed the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ministry said any project near Iran’s borders should be developed “with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and without foreign interference”. For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautiously welcomed the deal, saying on Saturday that Moscow supported efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the region, including the Washington meeting. “The involvement of non-regional players should strengthen the peace agenda, not create new divisions,” the ministry said, adding that it hoped to avoid the “unfortunate experience” of Western-led conflict resolution in the Middle East. A NATO member, Turkiye has strongly backed Azerbaijan in its conflicts with Armenia, but has pledged to restore ties with Yerevan after it signs a final peace deal with Baku. The Turkish presidency said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the peace agreement with Ilham Aliyev, his counterpart from Azerbaijan, and offered Ankara’s support in achieving lasting peace in the region. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also addressed the planned corridor during a visit to Egypt, saying it could “link Europe with the depths of Asia via Turkiye” and would be “a very beneficial development”. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Ahmad Shahidov, of the Azerbaijan Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected a final peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan to be signed in the coming weeks.

Article: The international community must “shoulder its responsibility” and take action against Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the Palestinian foreign affairs minister has told Al Jazeera before an emergency United Nations Security Council session. In an interview on Saturday, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin said the 15-member council must uphold international law when it convenes at UN headquarters in New York on Sunday to discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip. “What has been going in Palestine for the last 22 months is nothing but a genocide, and it’s part and parcel of Israel’s expansionist ideology that wants to take over the entirety of the occupied State of Palestine.” The Israeli security cabinet approved plans this week to seize Gaza City, forcibly displacing nearly one million Palestinians to concentration zones in the south of the bombarded coastal enclave. Palestinians have rejected the Israeli push to force them out of the city while human rights groups and the UN have warned that the plan will worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and lead to further mass casualties. Aghabekian Shahin told Al Jazeera that if Trump – whose administration continues to provide unwavering diplomatic and military support to Israel – wants to reach a solution, Palestinian rights must be taken into account. “There will be no peace in Israel-Palestine, or the region for that matter, or even the world at large, if the rights of the Palestinians are not respected,” she said, noting that this means a Palestinian state must be established. In a social media post on Friday, Netanyahu said he wants “a peaceful civilian administration” to be established in the enclave, “one that is not the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, and not any other terrorist organization”. “If Gaza wants to come back to the core, which is the entirety of the Palestinian land, then it has to become under the control and governance of the Palestinian Authority, the PLO.” Aghabekian Shahin also condemned the international community for failing to act as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a surge in Israeli military and settler attacks in the shadow of the country’s war on Gaza. “It is the inaction that has emboldened the Israelis, including the settlers, to do whatever they are doing for the last six decades, since day one of the 1967 occupation,” she said.

The arrests are the latest at a series of protests denouncing the government’s ban on Palestine Action, a move critics say infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest, as well as aims to stifle demonstrations against Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. Reporting from Parliament Square on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego said the threat of arrest or punishment “hasn’t deterred any supporters” of Palestine Action from expressing their backing for the group. “We’re now living in an alternative universe and I’m not going to accept it.” ‘Campaign of defiance’ In advance of Saturday’s protest, more than 200 people had been detained in a wave of demonstrations across the UK denouncing the ban since it came into force in July. More than 350 academics from around the world signed onto an open letter this week applauding a “growing campaign of collective defiance” against the decision by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to proscribe Palestine Action. The signatories “deplore the repressive consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond”, the letter read. Amnesty International UK has condemned the arrest of peaceful protesters solely for holding signs, saying such action constitutes “a violation of the UK’s international obligations to protect the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly”.

On Friday, the World Food Programme (WFP) called on Israel to allow the delivery of at least 100 aid trucks per day to Gaza, noting that only 60 of its aid truck drivers have been vetted and approved by the Israeli military to date. The 100 trucks per day the organisation called for is a fraction of the 600 per day other United Nations agencies and Gaza authorities have said are needed to meet the basic needs of Gaza residents. “Convoy movements are frequently hampered by last-minute changes by Israeli authorities, and heavy insecurity due to military activities along convoy routes.” In its latest statement on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, noted that it has not been allowed to bring any humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food and medicine, for more than five months, depriving hungry and ailing Palestinians of what they need to survive. Advertisement UNRWA has been calling on Israel to lift its siege on Gaza, saying the ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid from several countries “are very expensive and ineffective” at reaching those urgently in need. ‘No one and nowhere is safe’ As the death toll continues to soar, international condemnation of Israel’s conduct in the war is growing, with several countries raising alarm over Israel’s plans to seize Gaza City in an operation that could forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to concentration zones in southern Gaza. “People are wondering what’s going to happen to them, what’s going to be left of Gaza if Israel moves on with its approved plan to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza City,” he said. Speaking at a joint news conference in El Alamein with his Egyptian counterpart after meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Fidan said members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had been called to an emergency meeting to tackle the crisis.

Article: In a statement on Saturday, the Lebanese army said the unit was dismantling the contents of the depot in the Wadi Zibqin area, in the Tyre region, when the explosion occurred. The Lebanese army has been working with the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon (UNIFIL) to dismantle Hezbollah military infrastructure as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel that came into force in November. The deadly explosion comes as the Lebanese government this week approved United States-backed plans to disarm Hezbollah – a move the Lebanese group has rejected, saying such demands serve Israeli interests. UN spokesperson Farhan Haq had told reporters that peacekeepers and Lebanese troops found “three bunkers, artillery, rocket launchers, hundreds of explosive shells and rockets, anti-tank mines and about 250 ready-to-use improvised explosive devices”. pic.twitter.com/8s5EkNAdSh — Diodato Abagnara (@DiodatoAbagnara) August 9, 2025 Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said in a social media post on Saturday that “Lebanon mourns” the soldiers who were killed “while fulfilling their national duty”.

Article: India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during fighting in May, India’s air force chief says, the first such statement from the country since the deadly conflict with its neighbour. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh made the announcement on Saturday, weeks after India’s military acknowledged that an unspecified number of its own jets were also shot down by Pakistan during their heaviest fighting in decades. “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed and one large aircraft,” Singh said at a military lecture in the southern city of Bengaluru, adding that the large aircraft, which could have been a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300km (186 miles). “If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification – though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in a social media post. “Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment.” Singh, the Indian air force chief, did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed but said air strikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F-16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two airbases in southeastern Pakistan.

Article: Three Thai soldiers have been injured by a landmine while patrolling the border with Cambodia, according to the army, days after the two neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire following a violent five-day conflict last month. One soldier lost a foot and two others were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine as they patrolled an area between Thailand’s Sisaket and Cambodia’s Preah Vihear provinces on Saturday morning, the Royal Thai Armed Forces said. Cambodia’s defence ministry said that it “has yet to receive clear confirmation from Cambodian frontline forces concerning the explosion,” adding that its army has been strictly respecting the spirit of the ceasefire. It would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty, the Thai foreign ministry said in a statement. The clashes halted with a ceasefire on July 28 after United States President Donald Trump warned both sides that he would not conclude trade deals with them if fighting continued. A meeting of defence officials in Kuala Lumpur ended on Thursday with a deal to extend the ceasefire, and the two sides also agreed to allow observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.

Article: United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced that the US is to cut funding for mRNA vaccine development – a move that health experts say is “dangerous” and could make the US much more vulnerable to future outbreaks of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. Kennedy is known for his vaccine scepticism and recently ousted all 17 members of a scientific advisory panel on vaccines at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be replaced with his own selections. However, this latest announcement is just part of a series of moves by President Donald Trump himself that appear to target the vaccine industry and give increasing weight to the arguments of vaccine sceptics in the US. “My main concern is that this is part of an increasingly ideological rather than evidence-based approach to healthcare and vaccination in particular that is being adopted in the US,” David Elliman, associate professor at University College London, told Al Jazeera. The main reason, he said, was that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had reviewed mRNA vaccines and found them to be “ineffective” in fighting mutating viruses. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts, … HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” Instead, Kennedy said, the US will shift mRNA funding to other vaccine development technologies that are “safer” and “remain effective”. Some notable institutions and companies that will be affected by the latest decision, as listed on the HHS website, include: Emory University and Tiba Biotech (terminated contracts) Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus (rejected or cancelled proposals) Luminary Labs, ModeX (“descoped” or weakened contracts) AstraZeneca and Moderna (“restructured” contracts) What are mRNA vaccines, and are they really ineffective against virus mutations? “The technology has great promise for vaccines and therapeutics, so ceasing research in the field without good evidence is unjustified.” The move, he added, could discourage investors and scientists, both inside and outside the US, from keeping up research. At the least, there should be notice and an opportunity for hearing and explanation under our administrative law, and there was instead a short and cursory X video with no references, no real data,” she said. In another 2023 podcast, Kennedy said, “No vaccine is safe or effective.” Aside from his vaccine scepticism, Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, has also made several controversial remarks about other health issues, such as COVID-19. We’re giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children.” In subsequent interviews, Trump called childhood vaccines a “monster shot” and in 2015 during a debate among Republican presidential candidates said vaccines were “meant for a horse, not a child”. Advertisement Additionally, in his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration initially downplayed the virus, but it ultimately oversaw the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines in a project it called Operation Warp Speed. In May, Kennedy announced that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women without giving details about the reasons behind the change in policy. In May, the FDA approved Novavax’s non-mRNA, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine although only for older adults and those over the age of 12 who also have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk from the virus. The 2026 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), a public-private entity formed in 2002 to support vaccine distribution to low and middle-income countries. GAVI was instrumental in securing vaccines for several countries in Africa and other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was feared that richer countries could stockpile the available doses. Trump’s health budget proposals in 2018 and subsequently proposed budget cuts to the National Institute of Health and the CDC would have impacted immunisation programmes and a wide range of life-saving research on vaccines.

Article: “I cannot wait to start learning from [manager] Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.” Manchester United, who finished 15th in the Premier League last season, have also signed forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for the new campaign, which starts at home against Arsenal on August 17. Advertisement “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football,” Jason Wilcox, Man United’s director of football, said in the club’s announcement. “The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United, as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.” Current United strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored just 18 goals between them in all competitions last term as United fell to a club-record 18 losses in the Premier League era and its lowest points total of 42. Only four teams scored fewer goals than United in the top flight last term – including the three relegated clubs – as the 20-time English champion recorded its lowest finish in the modern era when it placed 15th, just three places above the relegation zone. Sesko has been compared with former Paris Saint-Germain and United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic because of his height – both are 1.95 metres (6 feet, 5 inches) tall – and flashes of technical skill.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ruled out ceding land to Russia and demanded his country take part in negotiations aimed at ending the war between the neighbours, just days before planned talks between the leaders of Russia and the United States. In a video shared on social media on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for “real decisions” that could bring a “dignified peace” but stressed there could be no violation of the constitution on territorial issues. His comments came hours after US President Donald Trump said a peace deal would involve “some swapping of territories” as he announced a meeting on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the US state of Alaska to discuss the war. Advertisement Previously, the Kremlin has insisted that Ukraine give up the territories Russia occupies, and that Western nations stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and exclude the country from membership in the NATO military alliance. “There has been a lot of speculation over what a ceasefire agreement could look like in which the lines of contact between Russia and Ukraine could be frozen for a number of years,” Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javad reported from Moscow. “It is also not clear whether the Russian demand that NATO’s ambitions in Ukraine should be forever quashed is actually going to be met.” Separately on Saturday, Zelenskyy spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and urged Ukraine’s allies to take “clear steps” towards achieving a sustainable peace. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake.” Meanwhile, national security advisers from Ukrainian allies – including the US, European Union nations and the UK – gathered in Britain on Saturday to align their views ahead of the Putin-Trump summit. Ukraine and its European allies have long opposed any agreement that involves ceding occupied territory, but Putin has repeatedly said any deal must require Ukraine to relinquish some of the territories Russia has seized. Russia declared four Ukrainian regions that it does not fully control – Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Luhansk – its territory in 2022 and also claims the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Advertisement “We have a lot of hope that Trump will make Putin accept a real negotiation and a ceasefire to the conflict,” said Goncharenko, adding that the outcome of the war in Ukraine is crucial for Europe’s security, as well as that of his own country. “I think Europe is clearly on our side and Trump should [keep] Europe on its side.” Meanwhile, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov has said the talks between Putin and Trump next week will “focus on discussing options for achieving a long-term peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian crisis”.

Guardiola did not disclose the details of the injury but said the 29-year-old Spain international picked up the problem during City’s 4-3 loss against the Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in the round of 16 of the Club World Cup in July. “Rodri is getting better, but he had a big injury in the last game against Al Hilal,” Guardiola told reporters on Friday before Saturday’s friendly match against the Italian side Palermo. “Hopefully in these [first three Premier League] games, he can play some minutes, but what is important is that he doesn’t have pain because we don’t want Rodri coming back injured. “He has been training the last two sessions with us, and that’s good.” City, who finished third last season, begin their Premier League campaign away against Wolverhampton Wanderers on August 16.

Article: Peter Safar, an Austrian doctor, had just developed the basics of CPR, a lifesaving technique that keeps blood and oxygen flowing to the brain and vital organs after the heart has stopped beating. The Norwegian toymaker had a vision: It needed to look unthreatening, and assuming that men would not want to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a male dummy, it should be a woman. There are many rumours as to how the original mask was created, but one story that has cemented itself as urban legend is that it was of a woman who had supposedly drowned in the Seine River in 19th-century Paris. In the French capital at the time, it was common for the bodies of the deceased who could not be identified to be placed on black marble slabs and displayed in the window of the city’s morgue situated near Notre Dame Cathedral. The French writer Albert Camus called her the “drowned Mona Lisa”, while the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke said of her serene expression, “It was beautiful, because it smiled, because it smiled so deceptively, as if it knew.” Resusci Anne It is not known whether Laderdal was aware of the legend behind the painting in Stavanger, but in 1960, he gave it new life when the first CPR doll was officially launched with the subject’s face. As the story goes, the superstar heard the phrase during a first aid training session and, struck by the rhythm and urgency of it, worked it into the chart-topping song, Smooth Criminal, repeating it like a heartbeat: “Annie, are you OK? Are you OK, Annie?” ‘She would be proud’ Laerdal died in 1981, but the company he founded, Laerdal Medical, continues to be a juggernaut in emergency medical training and the development of cutting-edge healthcare technology. Pal Oftedal, director of Corporate Communications at Laerdal Medical, says that regardless of whether the story behind Annie is true, she has had a positive impact on engaging people worldwide in the lifesaving practice of CPR.

Article: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signed into law a bill easing environmental licensing rules, but bowed to pressure from activist groups as he vetoed key provisions that would have made it easier for companies to secure environmental permits. Lula approved on Friday what detractors have dubbed the “devastation bill”, but struck down or altered 63 of its nearly 400 articles, his office’s executive secretary, Miriam Belchior, told reporters. The president had faced mounting pressure from environmental groups to intervene in the bill, which was backed by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and focused on rolling back strict licensing rules that had kept the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in check. Lula’s environmental vetoes Of the provisions struck down by Lula, 26 were vetoed outright, while another 37 will either be replaced with alternative text or modified in a new bill that will be sent to Congress for ratification under a constitutional urgency procedure. Lawmakers aligned with embattled ex-president Jair Bolsonaro are also blocking legislative activity amid an escalating political standoff, as they call for the former president’s charges around an alleged failed coup attempt in 2022 to be dropped. Speaking at a Friday news conference in the capital, Brasilia, Environment Minister Marina Silva maintained a positive tone, telling reporters that Lula’s vetoes would ensure that “the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation”. Silva said a previous version of the bill, approved by Congress last month, threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework. But, she said, Lula’s revised version meant Brazil’s “targets to reach zero deforestation” and its goal to “cut CO2 emissions by between 59 percent and 67 percent remain fully on track”.

Article: But even as the ban was followed by police raids on several bookstores in the region’s biggest city, Srinagar, during which they seized books on the blacklist, Indian officials are holding a book festival in the city on the banks of Dal Lake. “Nothing is surprising about this ban, which comes at a moment when the level of censorship and surveillance in Kashmir since 2019 has reached absurd heights,” Kanjwal told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s crackdown on the region since it revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status six years ago. “It is, of course, even more absurd that this ban comes at a time when the Indian army is simultaneously promoting book reading and literature through a state-sponsored Chinar Book Festival.” Yet even with Kashmir’s long history of facing censorship, the book bans represent to many critics a particularly sweeping attempt by New Delhi to assert control over academia in the disputed region. ‘Misguiding youth’ The 25 books banned by the government offer a detailed overview of the events surrounding the Partition of India and the reasons why Kashmir became such an intransigent territorial dispute to begin with. Advertisement They include writings like Azadi by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy, Human Rights Violations in Kashmir by Piotr Balcerowicz and Agnieszka Kuszewska, Kashmiris’ Fight for Freedom by Mohd Yusaf Saraf, Kashmir Politics and Plebiscite by Abdul Gockhami Jabbar and Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? Then there are books like Kanjwal’s, journalist Anuradha Bhasin’s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 and legal scholar AG Noorani’s The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012, which dissect the region’s political journey over the decades. The government’s order states: “This literature would deeply impact the psyche of youth by promoting a culture of grievance, victimhood, and terrorist heroism.” The dispute in Kashmir dates back to 1947 when the departing British cleaved the Indian subcontinent into the two dominions of India and Pakistan. Muslim-majority Kashmir’s Hindu king sought to be independent of both, but after Pakistan-backed fighters entered a part of the region, he agreed to join India on the condition that Kashmir enjoy a special status within the new union with some autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. Some of Nehru’s decisions that have come under criticism include the unceremonious dismissal of the region’s leader Sheikh Abdullah, who advocated for self-rule for Kashmir, and the decision to replace him with his lieutenant, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, whose 10 years in office were marked by the strengthening of New Delhi’s rule of Indian-administered Kashmir. In 2010, after major protests broke out following the killing of 17-year-old student Tufail Mattoo by security forces, the provincial government banned SMS services and restored them only three years later. At the height of another civil uprising in 2016, the government stopped Kashmir Reader, an independent publication in Srinagar, from going to press, citing its purported “tendency to incite violence”. “First they came for journalists, and realising they were successful in silencing them, they have turned their attention to academia,” said veteran editor Anuradha Bhasin, whose book on India’s revocation of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 is among those banned. “When my book went to print, the legal team vetted it thrice.” ‘A feeling of despair’ The book bans have drawn criticism from various quarters in Kashmir with students and researchers calling it an attempt to impose collective amnesia. “If these works are no longer available to me, my research is naturally going to be lopsided.” On Thursday, videos showed uniformed policemen entering bookstores in Srinagar and asking their proprietors if they possessed any of the books in the banned list. More acclaimed works on the blacklist Historian Sumantra Bose is aghast at the suggestion by Indian authorities that his book Kashmir at the Crossroads has fuelled violence in the region. In 1935, the colonial authorities in British India banned The Indian Struggle, 1920-1934, a compendium of political analysis authored by Subhas Chandra Bose, his great-uncle and a leader of India’s freedom struggle.

Plans are already in motion to continue Singapore’s growth, with its most famous landmark – Marina Bay Sands – set to house a new fourth tower of hotel rooms in 2029, while a 15,000-seat indoor arena will also be built at the site. “If it flooded a lot of the infrastructure in Singapore, closing down MRTs [mass rapid transit], shutting down emergency routes, flooding a power station and the electricity went down – Singapore would be crippled,” Horton said. “The resulting strain will not only test the resilience of healthcare institutions but also place significant emotional, physical, and financial pressure on family caregivers,” said Chuan De Foo, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The fertility rate, which measures the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, fell below 1.0 for the first time in 2023 and shows little sign of increasing. Kalpana Vignehsa, a senior research fellow at NUS’s Institute of Policy Studies think tank, said the Singapore government is “swimming against a cultural tide” in its efforts to reverse the decline in births. While the country’s leaders are likely to stay the same in the near-term, Teo Kay Key, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies Social Lab, said younger Singaporeans will soon want a different style of politics, one that is more open and more participatory.

Article: Twin cathedral bells will ring in unison in Nagasaki for the first time in 80 years, as the Japanese city commemorates the moment the United States decimated it with an atomic bomb eight decades ago. The US dropped an atomic bomb on the southwestern port city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, at 11:02am local time, three days after it dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima. The church in Nagasaki, widely known as Urakami Cathedral, was rebuilt in 1959 after it was almost completely destroyed in the monstrous atomic explosion, the hypocentre of which was just a few hundred metres from the religious building. Spearheading the fundraising campaign for the new church bell was James Nolan – a sociology professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, whose grandfather participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the US’s first nuclear weapons. “It’s not about forgetting the wounds of the past but recognising them and taking action to repair and rebuild, and in doing so, working together for peace,” Yamamura told the AFP news agency.

Article: Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war. They’re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.” Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won’t be easy. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.” Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution. “Putin will say, ‘Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.’ And Trump will say, ‘You’re right about that.’” “Putin is good at those stories,” McFaul continued. That’s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.” Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. Putin may try to “divert President Trump from Trump’s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,” said William Taylor, who was charge d’affaires at the U.S. “Then, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.” No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He’s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he’s an international pariah. “President Trump — just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator — is giving him legitimacy,” McFaul said. At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin’s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there “could be other people also” who interfered in the 2016 election.) This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin’s conduct of the war. “If President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he’s got, there could be a ceasefire.” Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, “will change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.” “That would be a positive diversion,” Coons added. “But it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.” An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.

Article: Marina Boland, 29, who lives across a highway from the prison, said, “It’s scary to think” that someone would be motivated to come to Bryan in connection with the controversies linked to Epstein, the wealthy financier who had cultivated friendships and relationships with powerful people, from business leaders to presidents. In recent weeks, the release of files related to Epstein has become a politically charged debate after the Trump administration said it would not put out all of the documents detailing the federal government’s investigation into him. Maxwell herself returned to the spotlight after it was revealed that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with her last month for nine hours over two days in a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. That stoked outrage among some current and former federal Bureau of Prisons employees who question why she would be placed there given her sex offense charges and the higher level of security she requires. Other residents questioned why Maxwell — w​​ho isn’t slated for release until July 2037, when she would be 75 — would get moved to a prison camp where security has traditionally been lax.

Article: Earnhardt family disputes aside, the fight in Mooresville echoes similar debates across the country as communities grapple with the potential economic benefits and environmental downsides of giant data centers that are swallowing land and resources to feed America’s insatiable demand for computing power. Crowds of people have packed meetings from Arizona to Alabama to express fears that these projects could overtax the electric grid, pollute the water and air, and generally disrupt their rural peace with hulking structures emitting a high-tech hum. The consulting company McKinsey said in April that it forecasts roughly $7 trillion in global spending on data centers in the next five years, sparked in large part by demand for processing power to meet the needs of tech companies racing to build and develop advanced artificial intelligence systems. In Oldham County, Kentucky, a data center developer pulled out of a project last month and the county’s fiscal court passed a moratorium on data centers after community pushback over environmental concerns. “The volume, speed, and effectiveness of local opposition are reshaping the landscape of political risks for the data center industry,” Data Center Watch said in a statement to NBC News. Sarah Lapidus / USA Today Network Wendy Reigel, an activist in Chesterton, Indiana, routinely gives advice to other communities fighting data centers after she started a successful movement against a $1.3 billion project in her town last year. “In the end, people need hope,” she said, “and then they need information, and then they got to work their rear ends off.” That’s what the organizers in Mooresville have been doing.

Article: ABOVE NORTHERN GAZA — From the sky, a besieged Gaza briefly came into view early Saturday as the military plane opened its back door and a mass of tents could be seen near the Mediterranean coast from a side window. But with mounting international outrage about deaths from starvation in Gaza under Israel’s offensive and crippling aid restrictions, several countries have started dropping food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza from the sky. Burney, who has been treating patients in Gaza for the past week as part of a team with MedGlobal, a Chicago-based nonprofit that arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, added that he had taken care of “multiple patients who’ve been crushed by these sort of unplanned, unannounced aid drops on top of their heads, literally on top of their heads.” Saturday’s flight from an air base just outside the Jordanian capital Amman took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government faced a wave of condemnation from European leaders, Arab nations and a group representing the families of hostages after it announced plans to take control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the plan on Friday as a “dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.” His colleague Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also said in a statement that “the Israeli Government should put all its efforts into saving the lives of Gaza’s civilians by allowing the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.” Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas. It lifted the blockade in May, allowing a basic amount of aid into Gaza, largely distributed under a controversial new distribution system led by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an update Tuesday. Omar Al-Qattaa / AFP - Getty Images Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to “distribute aid to Gaza residents independently.” It said that after “incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted” and that “systematic learning processes” to improve the operational response are underway. Aid groups have also pointed out that the drops can only provide a fraction of what is required for Gaza’s population of around 2 million people as the hunger crisis continues to spiral and much of the enclave plunge into famine conditions. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told journalists Thursday that at least 99 people, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year. Israel has maintained there is no starvation in Gaza and that the situation on the ground is being exaggerated, almost 22 months after it launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. Bashar Taleb / AFP - Getty Images Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed.

Article: Arizona police on Friday released new details about the fatal May drowning of influencer Emilie Kiser’s 3-year-old son, including allegations that her husband placed a $25 bet on an NBA playoff game before the tragic incident. Brady Kiser, the husband of the parenting influencer, was home with the couple’s two sons while his wife was out with friends on May 12 when Trigger drowned in the family’s backyard pool, according to the Chandler Police Department report unsealed on Friday. Police initially recommended that Kiser be charged with one count of child abuse, but the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office later determined that he would not face charges because there was “no reasonable likelihood of conviction.” Kiser’s lawyer previously said that he is “grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident.” According to the report obtained by People magazine, Kiser called the police around 6:41 p.m. In a series of subsequent interviews, Kiser detailed his day to officers after his wife left to meet friends, including feeding his kids dinner and sitting on the couch while watching Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics. It wasn’t that he had been out of sight for long.” Surveillance footage, however, showed that Trigger was unsupervised for at least nine minutes, and had been in the water for at least seven before Kiser found him, the report states. Around that same time, according to Kiser’s phone data detailed in the report, “a $25 wager was placed on Jayson Tatum scoring more than 40 points” on a sports betting app at around 5:14 p.m. The report states that the “wager was a winner, paying $102.50.” The report states that the incident was the result of Trigger being “unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim.” “It is clear Brady’s attention was divided,” the report added. The report’s release came one day after the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County ruled in Emilie Kiser’s favor after she requested to seal certain details about hr son’s death.

Article: Ventura County officials said Friday that firefighters were making “good progress in suppressing the blaze, aided by favorable weather conditions and the continued use of firefighting aircraft making repeated water and retardant drops to slow the fire’s advance and support crews on the ground.” Still, the fire remains an active threat and continues to spread further east into L.A. County Fire Department said three firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze and were taken to a local hospital “out of an abundance of caution,” but were expected to fully recover. Air quality issues are expected to linger through Sunday morning, according to the agency, which monitors air quality conditions for much of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Air pollution from wildfire smoke is a significant concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair.

Article: After starting 0-2 in five of its last six seasons, the team seemed to agree with criticism that trying to preserve its roster’s preseason health had stunted its readiness for the regular season. “It’s ridiculous.” Yet the Bengals’ shift in preseason philosophy isn’t the norm in a league where the preseason is getting started, but many of the biggest names will likely not. Inside the league, blame or praise for the trend of sharply reducing or outright eliminating starters’ preseason workloads is often attributed to Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay, who began holding out his best players entirely during the preseason in his second season in Los Angeles in 2018, even though the Rams were starting a young quarterback. Los Angeles went on to advance to the Super Bowl, and whether the preseason rest for key players was connected at all to its play during the regular season, it was enough in a copycat league — where new ideas do not stay proprietary for long — for others to adopt the same approach. During the 2024 preseason, 14 teams didn’t play their presumed starter for a single snap during the first two weeks of the preseason — up from just one team in 2014, according to a comparison done last year. “Sometimes what you do in practice and then play in a game is a whole different aspect.” McVay and the Rams might not have put their top players on ice during preseason games if not for the rise of another trend happening at the same time, as franchises increasingly began hosting “joint practices.” Their appeal stemmed from the opportunity for quality repetitions but in a more controlled scrimmage than a game. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams said he believed preseason “reps are always paramount for anybody like myself: a young rookie, second-year guy, [or] third-year guy.” Yet this year, as a second-year guy playing under a new head coach in Chicago, the quarterback will not play in the Bears’ preseason opener. This month, 30 of the 32 teams will play three preseason games — only the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions, who also played in the July 31 Hall of Fame exhibition, will play more — and many have signaled that they will again play starters and stars sparingly, if at all. He reportedly offered to play, but was among a group of 15 starters who will sit out at least the first preseason game because “they need less runway to take off, to be quite honest with you,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. A player as good as Burrow would seemingly need little proverbial runway, either, but he has called the Bengals’ change of philosophy “the right decision.” But not everyone is altering their approach to the preseason.

Article: As she juggled temp jobs, financial anxiety and a society that resisted making room for her, Butler wrote genre-defining literature that has been adapted for TV and film in recent years, and has continued to go viral nearly two decades after her death in 2006 at 58. “Positive Obsession,” named for a 1989 essay by Butler, pulls from journals, interviews and personal letters in Butler’s public archives to illuminate the forces that shaped her, revealing an ambitious and meticulous writer. Chrissandra Jallah For most of her career, Butler woke up before dawn to write for hours ahead of what she once called “lots of horrible little jobs.” As she toiled in factories and warehouses, washing dishes, inspecting potato chips and making telemarketing calls, Butler conjured characters from her everyday encounters. Morris told NBC that in sharing Butler’s story now, 19 years after her death, she hopes to inspire artists who don’t think they can afford to create to find the time. “In this economic system that we’re currently in, we are so crunched down trying to buy eggs or pay the rent,” Morris said “sometimes we don’t even feel like we can access art for art’s sake. Her novel “Kindred” was reimagined into a TV series in 2022, and authors John Jennings and Damian Duffy won a Hugo Award in 2021 for their graphic novel reimagining of her book “Parable of the Sower.” “Positive Obsession: The Life and Times of Octavia E. In “Parable of the Talents,” published in 1998 and set in the 2020s, Butler introduces a conservative presidential candidate who urges voters to join him in a project to “make America great again.” The words on the page reverberated through Morris’ classroom as she taught the book during Trump’s first presidency. Absolutely.” Morris uses the 1987 short story “The Evening and the Morning and the Night” — about a community grappling with a fictional genetic disorder — to talk to students about the marginalization of people with disabilities. Though often shelved as science fiction, Morris says Butler’s work transcends the label, and she instead classifies it as “speculative fiction.” Morris’ immersive portrait can at times feel like reading Butler’s journal or listening to the innermost thoughts of a quiet and sometimes lonely person. “I hope that in this world that is often devoid of beauty,” Morris said, “that other folks can see her example and find the beauty in their own kind of practice.”

Article: When Sheffield Wednesday FC kicks off the new season on Sunday — away at Leicester City in the Championship, the second tier of British soccer — more than 3,000 traveling fans will not take their seats to cheer on their beloved team, known as the Owls. Instead, they will hold a five-minute protest outside Leicester’s King Power Stadium against one man: Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, Wednesday’s owner and the focal point of a growing crisis that may threaten its very existence. The team’s financial problems are mounting, and unsuccessful attempts to sell it have dominated local sports media and online forums for months — and the crisis has much wider implications for the health of English soccer away from the glitzy riches of Liverpool and Manchester City. The problem is so acute that the British government has passed a new law that will launch a football regulator to police the buying and selling of teams and make sure owners are “fit and proper.” For Wednesday, founded in 1867, that could be too little, too late. Some teams have bad offseasons, but this summer has seen Wednesday set new levels of chaos: Players and staff have not been paid on time in four of the last five months. At least 15 players have left on free transfers or for a fraction of their market value this summer, leaving barely enough players to fill a match day squad of 11 starters and up to nine substitutes. “It’s becoming a soap opera,” said Dan Fudge, who co-hosts the popular podcast “The Wednesday Week.” “Usually, as podcasters, we’re scratching for content to talk about during the summer,” Fudge said, “but we seem to have had a new timeline of terror every single week to talk about.” The list of mishaps goes on. The famous old Hillsborough Stadium is literally falling apart — Sheffield City Council refused to grant a safety license for the vast 9,000-seat North Stand due to concerns of uncovering wiring and cracks in the terrace. Kieran Maguire, a leading British football finance expert and commentator, puts the real value at 40 million pounds ($53 million), but Chansiri said in June that he rejected an offer at this price from a U.S.-based consortium. Maguire said it was unlikely Wednesday would go bust entirely, but he said that in any case the team would almost certainly be relegated to the league below and face a very tough season. This summer alone, the 20 Premier League teams have spent around 1.8 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on transfer fees, with reigning champions Liverpool splashing out 252 million pounds ($335 million). Between them, the Premier League clubs made more than 6 billion pounds ($8 billion) in revenue in the 2024-25 season, an increase of 36% from the previous year, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. The league, criticized by some fans for not acting sooner, warned the Thai magnate that the club needed to “meet its obligations or make good on his commitment to sell to a well-funded party, for fair market value.” Could things even get worse? This week, Morecambe FC, a team in the northwest seaside town of the same name, was suspended from the National League, the fifth tier of English football’s sprawling pyramid-shaped league system, with the elite clubs at the top and smaller, more parochial clubs toward the bottom. “Then, over recent years, you look at teams like Bury and what’s recently happened to Morecambe, and they’ve not had that white knight step in, and all of a sudden we’re thinking, ‘Oh hang on a minute, we could be the big scalp.’” Like many fans, Fudge has no doubt who is to blame. “Pure ineptitude is how we’ve got here, regardless of the warning signs around Chansiri since about 2018.” Fans warmly remember the 1990s, when players such as Chris Waddle, David Hirst and Des Walker — all England internationals — lined up alongside some of the then-hottest talent in Europe, helping the club reach seventh place in the Premier League during the 1996-97 season. David Blunkett, a senior minister during Tony Blair’s government in the 1990s and 2000s and now a member of the House of Lords, is a lifelong Wednesday fan and attended an online meeting with the football league on Thursday. “Parliamentarians, including those representing the city, the Supporters’ Trust and other fans will clearly continue to pressurize for an immediate resolution of the crisis at Hillsborough,” he told NBC News. Hailing from the north side of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, a city famous for its steel, Wednesday became an early member of the Football Association (the term “soccer” is an abbreviation of “association”), as the football craze swept through working-class communities across the North and the Midlands. The team got its unique name from cricket: In the mid-19th century, there were multiple teams in Sheffield playing this game, and the one that played on Wednesdays started a football team. “There’s a lot of people that are very much in the camp of ‘Let’s protest, let’s get this message out as much as we can,’ which I completely agree with, but it’s not everybody’s bag, because a lot of people use the football to spend time with their family and their friends,” Fudge said.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. “I have so many people who come to me and say to me, ‘I love your music, I want to give, but I’m sorry, I don’t carry cash,’” said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. Evie Steele for NBC News There’s no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. “I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, ‘Thank you,’ because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away,” Deitz said. “But then people that didn’t pay see those people walk away, and they go, ‘Well, I guess it’s acceptable to walk away.’” For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. “People would stop and talk to us.” Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. “You might think that it’s worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you’re getting cash out of your wallet and you’re fumbling around for change.” But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think “tipping culture is out of control.” That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.

Article: To help pet parents (myself included) learn how to keep dogs cool in the heat, I talked to veterinarians about the best products to do so and safety tips to keep in mind. The best cooling products for dogs The type of cooling product you may want to use for your dog depends on the situation — for example, booties or paw balm is useful when walking on hot pavement, while water bottles keep pups hydrated. Best water sprayer Instead of putting your dog in a pool to get their paws wet, you can use a hose or put them in the bathtub or shower, so long as the water isn’t hot, says Kaplan. Best cooling dog bed Coolaroo The Original Elevated Dog Bed $ 32.46 Amazon What to know What we like Multiple sizes available Easy to clean Breathable fabric Something to note Assembly required Outdoor dog beds prevent pups from lying on hot surfaces indoors and outdoors. Best dog cooling mat Cooling mats give dogs a cold surface to rest on indoors or outdoors, says Sara Bonomo, a certified dog trainer and the owner of All 4 Paws. The best hydrating products for dogs Best water bowl Ensuring your dog has access to fresh water at all times is important regardless of the weather, but it becomes even more crucial when it’s hot out — dogs tend to drink more during high temperatures to stay hydrated, so be sure to refill their bowl often, says Kaplan. Petlibro’s water fountain has a 2.1-gallon capacity, and between Mabel and my two cats drinking out of it, I refill it every few days by pouring water directly into the serving tray. PupFlask’s dishwasher-safe dog water bottle comes in two sizes (27 and 40 ounces) and it’s composed of two parts: a stainless steel bottle that stores water and a silicone lid that folds into a drinking bowl. Best cooling enrichment toy In addition to drinking water, licking ice cubes and other frozen treats can keep dogs hydrated, plus it gives them an engaging indoor activity to do if it’s too hot for outdoor play or walks. The spherical-shaped rubber toy rolls around while dogs use it so they have to work for their frozen treat, keeping them entertained for 15 to 30 minutes, in my experience. The best sun protection products for dogs Best dog booties Ruffwear Grip Trex Dog Boots $ 44.95 Amazon What to know What we like Breathable fabric Thick, grippy outsole Multiple sizes available Something to note Uncomfortable for some dogs Booties protect dogs’ paws from hot pavement, and Ruffwear sells one of Bonomo’s favorite pairs. Musher’s Secret Dog Paw Wax is made with natural waxes and oils like vitamin E and beeswax, ingredients that create an invisible protective barrier on paw pads and keep them soft so they don’t dry out, according to the brand. Sunscreen can help protect your pup from UV rays, so long as you use an option that’s specifically made for dogs — some ingredients in sunscreen for humans are toxic to dogs if ingested, like zinc oxide, which is often in mineral sunscreen, according to the American Kennel Club. Best UPF clothing DogZStuff Dog Cooling Vest with UV Protection $ 24.95 Amazon What to know What we like Dog sunscreen alternative Doubles as a cooling towel Multiple sizes available Something to note Nothing to note at this time UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) measures a product’s ability to block sunlight, and UPF clothing, hats and goggles can act as an alternative to dog sunscreen if you find it challenging to apply, experts say. How to keep dogs cool: The top do’s and don’ts, according to vets Regardless of whether you live in a warm climate year-round or temperatures are rising in your area due to seasonality, your goal as a dog owner is to prevent your pet from overheating in the first place instead of working to cool them down afterward, says Kaplan. In extreme temperatures, like those you may experience during a heat wave, only take your dog outside for about five to 10 minutes, or just enough time to relieve themselves, says Satchu. Once you factor in humidity, 70-degree temperatures, which may be relatively comfortable for us, can feel much warmer for dogs since their average body temperatures are naturally a few degrees higher than humans, experts told me. Thus, 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the absolute maximum indoor temperature dogs should be exposed to if necessary — it should not be their norm, and it’s only safe if they have access to plenty of fresh water, can lay on cool surfaces like tile floors and are not exposed to direct sunlight, says Kratt. That’s why it’s important to check on your dog when they spend time outside and keep an eye out for telltale signs they’re overheating, including: Anxiousness or relentlessness Excessive panting and drooling Rapid breathing Vomiting or diarrhea Abnormal gum and tongue color Unsteadiness, disorientation and collapse If you’re concerned that your dog is severely overheating or experiencing heatstroke, take them inside immediately and bring them to a veterinarian, says Kratt.

The best cushioned running shoes Best overall The New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 may have a mouthful of a name, but they are excellent running shoes available in a variety of colors. The best supportive running shoes Best for wide feet and bunions These cushioned, chunky shoes have a spacious and wide toe box — Cunha recommends them for people with wide feet or bunions. These shoes strike a great balance between cushion and responsiveness — I feel fast, but not so connected to the pavement that every nook and cranny feels like a surprise. Try them on in-person Both Cunha and Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City, recommend going to a local running shoe store for the best fit possible. “It doesn’t matter if they still look new: if the support is worn out, you’re at a much higher risk of injury.” To keep track of when it’s time to replace your shoes, note the date you buy a new pair, and keep track of that six-month interval, says Cunha.

Article: How we picked top-rated emergency kits and supplies Using guidance from reputable agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Red Cross, we selected emergency kits based on the following criteria: Supplies included: All of the above organizations suggest an emergency kit that includes some variation of the following: First aid: suitable to the size and medical need of your family Sustenance: water (one gallon per person per day) and non-perishable food that can last several days Hygiene: moist towelettes and garbage bags Light: flashlight Shelter: plastic sheeting and emergency blankets Communication: whistles, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio (with NOAA Weather Radio, if possible), cell phone and cell phone charging cables Tools: disposable batteries, duct tape, multitool or wrench, can-opener (if kit contains canned food) and local maps Protection: N95 masks Household size: Emergency kits are designed for a specific number of people. Best overall This three-day emergency kit includes a variety of agency-recommended items like a hand-crank radio, first-aid kit and multiple water pouches, plus some additional nice-to-haves, like water purification tablets, nylon rope, a sewing kit, a candle and hand warmers. The supplies are labeled and color-coated in bags that have a QR code that you can scan to find out more about how to use them, according to the brand. Best for one person A one-person emergency kit is great for individuals or as a small backup option to keep in places like cars, boats or your place of work.

Tools and Shelter The right tools and shelter can make it easier to shut off damaged household utilities (in case of downed wires, for example), open canned food and shelter in place. Both organizations also list supplemental emergency supplies that may be useful, including: Prescription medications (three-day supply) and medical items Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea, antacids or laxatives Prescription eyeglasses and contact lens solution Infant supplies Pet food and water Extra cash Copies of personal documents (medication list and pertinent medical information, proof of address, deed/lease to home, passports, birth certificates, insurance policies) Sleeping bags Towels Climate-appropriate change of clothes and shoes Work gloves Scissors Fire extinguishers Menstrual supplies Set of dishes and utensils Paper and pencils Entertainment (books, games, puzzles, etc.) Is it cheaper to build your own emergency kit?

Article: As Southern California continued to experience a heat wave, officials on Saturday lifted the final evacuation orders in areas affected by the Canyon fire, which has burned more than 5,000 acres in northern Los Angeles and Ventura counties. With the fire about 28% contained, overnight fire activity was “minimal” and crews worked to further secure the perimeter, protect structures and look for hot spots, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Advertisement Battalion Chief James Agee of the Kern County Fire Department was seriously injured Friday when the pickup truck he was driving rolled over in the Romero Canyon area in Castaic, where he was involved in a team effort to monitor Canyon fire along the ridge line, a fire official said. Andrew Freeborn, a public information officer for the Kern County Fire Department, did not confirm Agee’s assignment, but said he was in a “lead position for a task force, which was made up of five fire engines and approximately 17 people.” Agee was driving by himself when the truck rolled over into steep terrain. “James is a strong man with a big heart, and we know he’s facing this challenge with the same strength and character he’s shown throughout his career,” said Kern County Fire Chief Aaron Duncan in a statement. “We are grateful for the swift actions of our crews and partner agencies, and for the kindness being shown to his family.” Advertisement Agee is in stable condition but still being treated for his serious injuries, the public information officer said Saturday. “But then you look at the response and how quickly care is then provided because our firefighters are all very well trained, and sometimes our training is applied to ourselves.” The region’s hot spell hampered efforts to quell the fire, triggering poor air conditions , according to the National Weather Service. Advertisement Inland valley areas were expected to see triple-digit temperatures throughout the weekend, with forecast highs of 106 in Lancaster and 103 in Northridge, according to the National Weather Service . “There is a moderate risk for heat related illnesses for vulnerable populations, and any fire starts in interior areas could grow rapidly, as we saw with the Canyon Fire on Thursday,” the National Weather Service said on X.

Article: Though it was not yet noon, the temperature was already inching toward triple digits, and it felt even hotter for the scores of farmworkers hunched in the rows of watermelon plants in this field tucked by a bend in the Sacramento River north of California’s capital. Their boss, Jose Chavez, said he tries to be vigilant about the danger of heat illness, making sure there is plenty of drinking water in the fields and that workers can take breaks in the shade and knock off early on blistering days. “When you start taking people to the hospital, it’s not fun.” That lesson, however, has not stuck with many employers, and 20 years after California enacted a landmark heat safety law, farmworkers across the state are still getting sick and sometimes dying from preventable heat illness. Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), a former farmworker who carried legislation last year that would have made it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation if they were stricken by heat illness on the job. People are dying.” Last month, the California state auditor blasted the California Department of Occupational Health and Safety , finding, among other problems, that the agency’s inspectors failed to take proper action when workers suffered heat illness on the job. Advertisement The enforcement lapses come at a time when farmworkers — many of whom lack legal status and fear deportation — are already hesitant to voice complaints about working conditions, fearful that employers could retaliate by reporting them to immigration authorities. This week, as the hottest temperatures of the summer descend just as harvest season hits its peak — and at a time when the Trump administration has stepped up immigration raids across California — some say farm laborers face more risks that ever. Cruz was the fourth farmworker to die in that brutal summer 20 years ago, in which heat deaths also claimed a man picking bell peppers in Arvin, a melon picker in Fresno County and a grape picker in Kern County. Advertisement The rules, which were the first of their kind in the country, require bosses to provide outdoor workers with fresh water, access to shade when the temperatures climb, and breaks to cool off whenever workers request them. In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers union sued Cal/OSHA, saying the statute was too weak and the agency’s enforcement was “woefully inadequate.” The suit said 11 farmworkers had died since the law went into effect. Three years later, the nonprofit law firm Public Counsel filed another suit, alleging that the state’s failure to enforce the problems had persisted, and that farmworkers were continuing to die. Of more than 1,200 workers surveyed, 43% reported that their employers had not provided a heat illness prevention plan and 15% said they had not received heat illness prevention training. It’s excuse after excuse, year after year.” This year, Assemblywoman Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced another proposed law, similar to the one Newson vetoed last year, making it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation.

Advertisement “Silence is Violence” “Migrants Don’t Party With Epstein” Cynthia Lunine, 70, carried a large sign that read “Break His Dark Spell” and included a sinister image of President Trump. Advertisement But the administration’s blather about a focus on violent offenders led to huge demonstrations in greater Los Angeles beginning in June, and the cause continues to draw people into the streets.

Once a week, Nicholls helps organize a rally that includes a march through the parking lot and into the store, where the protesters present a letter asking Home Depot management to “say no to ICE in their parking lot and in their store.” Nicholls is an LAUSD teacher-librarian, and when she asks for support each week, working and retired teachers answer the call. “I’m yelling my lungs out,” said retired teacher Mary Rose O’Leary, who joined in the chants of “ICE out of Home Depot” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” Sharon Nicholls gets a hug of support from another protester outside the Home Depot in Pasadena. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) “Immigrants are what make this city what it is … and the path to legal immigration is closed to everybody who doesn’t have what, $5 million or something?” O’Leary said, adding that she was motivated by “the Christian ideal of welcoming the stranger.” Advertisement Retired teacher Dan Murphy speaks Spanish and regularly checks in with day laborers. “One guy said to me, ‘We’re just here to work.’ Some of the guys were like, ‘We’re not criminals … we’re just here … to make money and get by,’” Murphy said. And it bothers me what might happen in this country if people don’t stand firm … I just said, ‘I gotta do something.’ I’m doing this now so I don’t hate myself later.” Nicholls told me she was an activist many years ago, and then turned her focus to work and raising a family. “You’d see them in orange shirts all over the city, cleaning up.” The East Pasadena Home Depot is “an important store,” because it’s a supply center for the rebuilding of Altadena, “and we’re going out there to show our love and solidarity for our neighbors,” Nicholls said. To strike the fear of deportation in the hearts of workers, she said, is “inhumane, and to me, it’s morally wrong.” Nicholls had a quick response when I asked what she thinks of those who say illegal is illegal, so what’s left to discuss? When the raids began, Nicholls said, she told her husband, “I have the summer off, sweetie, but I want to help, and I’m going to call my friends.” On Wednesday, after Nicholls welcomed demonstrators, Alvarado showed up for a pep talk. “Some people may say that we are going into fascism, into authoritarianism, and I would say that we are already there.” He offered details of a raid that morning at a Home Depot in Westlake and said the question is not whether the Pasadena store will be raided, but when. Advertisement “When humble people are attacked,” he said, “we are here to bear witness.” Nicholls led demonstrators through the parking lot and into the store, where she read aloud the letter asking Home Depot to take a stand against raids.

Article: The plan would almost double the company’s current timetable of 50 rockets a year, despite clashing with the California Coastal Commission over concerns about the impact that the blasts could have on coastal wildlife, and on nearby residents who have reported startling sonic booms with the already steep rise in launches. But the Air Force and SpaceX have quickly moved to dramatically increase the number of rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force in Santa Barbara County, asking the commission to agree to 36, then to 50, and now 95 rocket blasts a year. The fast uptick in rocket launches off the California coast has put the space exploration company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in direct conflict with the California Coastal Commission, whose members have raised concerns about the impact of the launches, the lack of monitoring and whether the privately owned company is circumventing the permit process because it is a federal contractor, despite most of the rocket launches involving no equipment or missions for U.S. During the October meeting, commissioners cited concerns that Musk had inserted himself into the presidential race, spread conspiracy theories on social media and faced serious allegations that employees at his companies have been mistreated. Commissioners have also pointed to reports that Musk’s company, Starlink, had refused to allow Ukraine to use satellite internet service to help carry out an attack against Russia in 2022, and questioned whether Musk’s decisions did not directly conflict with those of a U.S. Advertisement Cooperation between the state commission and the Department of Air Force also seems to have flailed after the October meeting, with little agreement or communication between the two agencies. During the October meeting when the commission rejected the plan for 50 launches, officials from the base said they had hoped to work with the commission to address seven conditions that had been requested from the U.S. Advertisement The plan for more launches, submitted by the Air Force to the commission, would also double the number of landing events at the military base, which have also been reported to generate their own sonic boom blast. According to the staff report, the base expects 24 SpaceX rocket landing events a year at Vandenberg, including 12 first-stage booster landings and five Falcon Heavy missions that would have two boosters landing simultaneously at the base. On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission is scheduled to consider SpaceX’s plan to fire 95 rockets a year, but military officials are expected to move forward with the plan despite the panel’s decision. Military officials have argued that the SpaceX launches should be considered federal activity because all of the launches — even those done for the private benefit of Musk’s company, Starlink — also benefit U.S. A previous staff report from the commission stated that 87% of SpaceX launches from Vandenberg weren’t carrying equipment or conducting missions for government agencies, but were carrying equipment for Starlink. launch providers continue to innovate, offering agile, service-based solutions that operate at the ‘speed of need.’ ” Staff for the coastal commission are expected to again raise concerns about the doubling of rocket launches from the base, arguing that military officials and SpaceX are not providing enough information about the impacts on wildlife, are failing to do enough monitoring to measure the impacts and reach of sonic booms, and that SpaceX should seek permits for its launches because it is conducting them for private benefit, not for the federal government. “Rather, the existing available information indicates that the proposed launch cadence’s primary purpose is to further expand and support SpaceX’s commercial satellite internet and telecommunications network, Starlink.” Despite the pending lawsuit, staff for the coastal commission continue to argue in its report that launches by SpaceX should be regulated as a private company.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the operations in a statement to The Times on Saturday, calling them “targeted immigration raids” that resulted in the arrests of seven undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. Advertisement Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said four of those individuals had criminal records, including for driving under the influence of alcohol, disorderly conduct and failing to adhere to previous removal orders.

A number of unmarked white vans started circling the parking lot and immigration agents began “grabbing people first and then asking people for ID” said Ortiz, adding that her organization has confirmed 10 people were taken. “It is very clear they are targeting day laborers and they are targeting the organization.” Advertisement Ortiz said immigration agents conducted another raid near a Home Depot in Cypress Park on Saturday. district judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. The Trump administration has since appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the ruling “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Following the temporary restraining order, Southern California saw a significant drop in the number of undocumented immigrants arrested. Then on Wednesday, Customs and Border Protection agents burst out of a Penske rental truck and detained day laborers at a Westlake Home Depot in a raid dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse.” Immigration protests grew heated at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly around 9 p.m. “Our communities deserve dignity and to not be harassed.” At a news conference Friday, Feldstein Soto said that video from the Westlake raid appeared to show the Trump administration violating the court’s temporary restraining order but noted that the matter was still under investigation. Advertisement “We are very cognizant of the fact that that Penske truck seemed to be engaged in a lot of the exact behavior that the language of the TRO specifically prohibits,” she said. A Penske spokesman previously told The Times that the company was not aware its trucks would be used in the operation and had not authorized the federal government to do so. “The Border Patrol, CBP and our allied law enforcement partners, when we conduct law enforcement operations, we always abide by the law — whether it’s a temporary restraining order ... “We’re going after it, and that’s exactly what we did.” Advertisement He said that of the 16 people apprehended during Operation Trojan Horse, at least six had “significant immigration and criminal histories.” He said this reflects the trend seen in larger immigration operations, where 30% to 40% of people arrested typically have significant immigration and criminal histories.

But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday evening, Abbott vowed “to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.” In addition to arrest on civil warrants, the Democrats are facing threats of being removed from office. The redistricting fight has strengthened Newsom’s national platform as a potential 2028 presidential contender and bolstered his reputation as a Democrat willing to take the fight to Trump and his allies. Since Trump took office in January, Newsom had been walking a fine line between calling out the president and working with him in hopes of being able to join together to rebuild from the California wildfires. But Newsom took a hard line after Trump deployed the National Guard during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles in June, prompting the governor and his administration to much more aggressively resist the president’s agenda.

Article: A former Los Angeles police officer has been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping for ransom and is being investigated in connection with other alleged crimes in San Fernando Valley neighborhoods that he used to patrol, according to department sources and jail records. Advertisement Details about the alleged kidnapping are murky, but several department sources — who requested anonymity to discuss the open case — said Halem is also being investigated in connection with home invasions that occurred in the West Valley Division, where he worked until several years ago. In an unattributed statement sent Friday afternoon in response to questions from The Times, the LAPD confirmed Halem’s arrest but said it was “not related to the Departments investigation into residential burglaries in the west valley.” Advertisement “This matter remains under investigation, and we will not be providing further details at this time,” the statement said. The West Valley includes Encino, an affluent area that has been on edge following a series of home break-ins, including one that caused the deaths of “American Idol” music supervisor Robin Kaye and her rock musician husband, Tom DeLuca. Emmett was the subject of a 2022 Times investigation and subsequent Hulu documentary that surfaced allegations of abuse against women and assistants as well as mistreatment of assistants and business partners. Around the same time, Halem landed small roles in TV shows like “Vanderpump Rules” and “Midnight in the Switchgrass.” Earlier this year he and his brother were charged with insurance fraud over what prosecutors alleged was an elaborate insurance fraud scheme related to a Bentley crash in January 2023. Eric Halem ran several car rental companies, Kaypr and Drive LA, which boasted a fleet of rare, luxury vehicles, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a neon green Lamborghini Urus. After the rental driver’s insurance claim was denied because of a lack of proper coverage, Eric Halem filed a fraudulent claim for more than $200,000 with his insurance company on his personal policy, misrepresenting details of the accident, authorities allege. The LAPD reserve program that Halem was part of dates to World War II, and today reserves number in the 300s, and its membership over the years has included not only one time cops, but also ER doctors and a former City Council member.

Article: As “Madame Web” star Sydney Sweeney remains mum on allegations of promoting eugenics via her American Eagle advertisement, she has seemingly stirred up even more support from far-right figures after recently gaining the favor of President Trump. A black-and-yellow banner covering a billboard on the 91 Freeway in Corona boldly states: “Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney,” according to a photo that one Corona resident shared with ABC7. Note “genes,” not “jeans.” It’s worth remembering that President Trump during a 2020 presidential debate ordered the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” when pressed about condemning right-wing violent extremists. Posters for the American Eagle campaign also featured the totally innovative, never-before-seen wordplay on “jeans” and genes.” A slogan reads, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes,” with the final word crossed out and replaced with “jeans.” Advertisement Sweeney, who seems to have a penchant for odd marketing opportunities, and the ads quickly faced criticism on social media, with users alleging the campaign leaned into the language of eugenics. In an attempt to quell the ire, American Eagle posted a statement stating that its campaign “is and always was about the jeans.” Sweeney and the American Eagle campaign notably found support among the conservative crowd — it wasn’t the first time for the 27-year-old “Immaculate” actor. In an earlier version of his post, Trump misspelled the actor’s name as “Sidney Sweeney.” He also used the post to diss brands he claimed used “woke” marketing, including Jaguar and Bud Light.

Article: Hours after the Trump administration demanded that the University of California pay a $1-billion fine to settle federal accusations of antisemitism in exchange for restoring frozen grant funding to UCLA, Gov. President Trump is “trying to silence academic freedom” by “attacking one of the most important public institutions in the United States of America,” Newsom said, adding that he would “stand tall and push back against that, and I believe every member of California Legislature feels the same way.” Advertisement California UCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant negotiations, Newsom says Making his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do ‘the right thing.’ The federal government on Friday said UC should pay the billion-dollar fine in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In addition, the Trump administration demanded sweeping campus changes encompassing protests, admissions, gender identity in sports and housing, the abolition of scholarships for racial or ethnic groups, and submission to an outside monitor over the agreement, according to four UC senior officials who have reviewed the proposal. Advertisement The governor appeared to be referring to controversial and costly deals the Trump administration secured from Columbia and Brown universities over charges similar to those facing UCLA, deals Newsom criticized a day earlier in public remarks. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump’s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” Milliken said. economy, and protect our national security.” Advertisement UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times the university was still willing to negotiate with the Trump administration but not on “unacceptable” terms. “Demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA, coupled with conditions that contradict the university’s values, is unacceptable,” Reilly said, describing it as a “financial burden” that would be “catastrophic for our students, research, our patients and the people of California. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. So how does that make sense?” Advertisement But another senior UC official said the figure was understandable if it resolved all federal investigations across the system, even if UC may not ultimately agree to it. UC and individual campuses are under multiple federal investigations into alleged use of race in admissions, employment discrimination against Jews, civil rights complaints from Jewish students and improper reporting of foreign donations. The encampment, which unsuccessfully demanded the university divest from weapons companies tied to Israel’s war in Gaza, was targeted in a violent overnight attack last spring and was later the subject of federal lawsuit by pro-Israel Jewish students. The Trump administration’s Friday offer follows a similar playbook to agreements it reached with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding and resolve allegations of civil rights violations against Jewish and Israeli students.

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required. “This is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it’s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the 5th Amendment guarantees.” Debrorah Fleischaker, the former chief of staff at U.S. “My guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.” Eduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood, said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed.

Article: Firefighters are continuing to make progress battling a wildfire burning in the hills near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, allowing thousands of evacuated residents to return to their homes Friday evening as public health officials warned of potentially unhealthy air in the area through the weekend. Friday, crews had reached 28% containment on the 5,370-acre Canyon fire burning near Castaic, which broke out amid a heat wave Thursday and has destroyed at least two buildings and injured three firefighters, according to the L.A. Evacuation orders affecting around 2,700 residents have been downgraded to warnings, while evacuation warnings affecting around 14,000 residents have been lifted, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “I think residents in the area can be thankful for the firefighters that came here to help serve them.” Advertisement At 6:20 p.m., a single vehicle rolled over at the scene of the fire and one person was taken to a hospital for treatment, Dowd said. According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, smoke from the Canyon fire is causing unhealthy air quality in Los Angeles County, primarily in the 5 Freeway corridor near Castaic Lake. Taking advantage of cooler temperatures Thursday night into Friday morning, crews were able to make inroads against the fast-moving blaze that grew to several thousand acres in a matter of hours, Dowd said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) Dowd said he expects containment to grow over Friday night as firefighters double down on the work that’s been done so far — “so that’s patrolling, mopping up, reinforcing containment lines, addressing hot spots and flareups as they occur, and continuing to provide structure defense and structure protection to those properties that may be at risk.” Residents in the Val Verde area said flames were visible from the neighborhood’s western edge Thursday, but the threat appeared to have calmed a bit by Friday morning, though the air remained thick with soot and ash. This is a pretty big threat to the community.” The Canyon fire quickly became one of the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. Temperatures were forecast to peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, and that heat plus the winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend, said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,” the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast. (Eric Thayer / Getty Images) Advertisement The American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the fire’s proximity to the Pitchess Detention Center, where about 5,000 inmates are housed in four jails. “It’s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn’t reach them.” The L.A. “Similar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter-in-place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,” agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement. The Fire Management Assistance Grant can provide federal funding for up to 75% of eligible firefighting costs, including expenses for field camps, equipment use, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities, according to FEMA.

Italian restaurant-goers were advised to ditch steak and potatoes to try “authentic” Italian food like artichokes, and the “peculiarly seasoned tomato sauce.” Or they could join movie stars and sports heroes for original chili burgers at “Ptomaine Tommy’s” in Lincoln Heights, which started out in 1913 as a street lunch wagon. Clifton’s, founded in the Depression year of 1931, once ran a chain of cafeterias arguably less notable for the food — beef dishes, fried chicken, Jell-o salads — than for the elaborate décor of religious dioramas, exotic South Seas vistas, and redwood faux forests. In the 18 decades since the Bella Union’s opened a kitchen, Angelenos never lost their beefsteak appetites, and 20th century steakhouses arose as haute cuisine, with steak places arrayed along La Cienega’s “Restaurant Row.” In Studio City, Glendale, Palm Springs and Bakersfield, waiters at the Saddle and Sirloin restaurants handed diners a page of beef choices, and a few chicken and fish alternatives, printed on a die-cut menu embossed to look like a fancy gun holster. Woody Allen made fun of the place and its vibe in “Annie Hall.” His character met Diane Keaton there and snottily ordered “alfalfa sprouts and mashed yeast.” The food reform movement was a hit with Angelenos. “From here you go into the world of alfalfa sprouts.” Advertisement Our big, warm climate and our wide-open spaces made possible something that earned its own genre: mimetic architecture, whimsical buildings that look like something else, often the thing that they sell.

A high-profile law firm representing the city of Los Angeles in a sweeping homelessness case submitted an $1.8-million invoice for two weeks of work in May, according to records reviewed by The Times. With at least 15 of Gibson Dunn’s lawyers billing at nearly $1,300 per hour, the price tag so far equates to just under $140,000 per day over a 13-day period. Los Angeles officials retained the law firm in May, roughly a week before a seven-day evidentiary hearing to determine whether control over the city’s homelessness programs should be taken away from Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council and turned over to a third-party receiver. “Instead, they are paying a law firm to fight tooth and nail against obligations that are clear in the settlement agreement — and that a judge has affirmed they are in violation of.” Advertisement The invoice, which The Times obtained from the city attorney’s office, lists a billing period from May 19 to May 31, covering a week of preparations for the high-stakes federal hearing, as well as four of the seven trial days — each of which typically lasted eight or more hours. city’s homelessness programs over to a receiver After hearing seven days of testimony, a federal judge is deliberating on a request from a group of business owners, property owners and residents to place the city of Los Angeles’ billion-dollar homelessness programs under a receivership.

During the seven-day hearing, Gibson Dunn took a highly aggressive posture, voicing numerous objections to questions from attorneys representing the Alliance, as well as two organizations that intervened in the case. Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who serves on the council’s homelessness committee, said the city attorney’s office did not advise him that Gibson Dunn’s legal costs had reached $1.8 million in such a short period. McOsker, who serves on the budget committee and spent several years running the city attorney’s office, also did not receive notification of the Gibson Dunn $1.8-million invoice from the city’s legal team, according to Sophie Gilchrist, his spokesperson.

While Jason Hong was celebrating his 75th birthday, he suddenly found himself thinking about his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk, a white and red single-engine beauty with colorful stripes that he calls his “old treasure.” He doesn’t fly it much anymore, but given the occasion he resolved to visit his plane as soon as he could to “say hi,” like a lifelong friend you see around holidays and special occasions. As Hong would come to find out, the colorful aircraft had been flown across Southern California by an unknown pilot, unnoticed, in a series of joyrides — or joy flights — at least twice before and then simply returned to the airport. After finding his plane a second time, Hong said he’s tried to put details of the thefts together, but the more he learns the more he grows confused about the circumstances. Hong looked up his plane on Flight Aware, a site that tracks flights and aircraft, and found that on his 75th birthday, someone took off with his plane from La Verne airport at 9:54 p.m., for a 51-minute flight that at one point neared Palm Springs. A few hours later, on July 26, the colorfully striped plane was in the air once again, this time for a brief 22-minute flight from Riverside County toward La Verne that started at about 1:30 a.m. The replacement of the battery, Hong said, also suggests its someone familiar with not just flying, but the mechanics of the plane as they seemed to have the tools and know-how about the type of battery needed, and how to install it.

Article: Myra Villarreal wipes tears as her son Adrian Martinez, 20, describes how he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. Advertisement Civil rights activists, city leaders, immigrants and their advocates were hopeful that the indiscriminate sweeps targeting Latinos were over in July after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that Border Patrol agents’ profiling tactics violated the 4th Amendment. Mayor Karen Bass said it appears as if the Wednesday raid at a Home Depot in Westlake — dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” — violated the order, but city attorneys are still trying to determine the facts. Advertisement Now other parts of the country are watching the events in California, expecting federal agents to target their immigrant communities, particularly in states with no judicial orders blocking them. “We’re just waiting for the shoe to drop.” The Times reviewed dozens of witness and surveillance videos, pored through criminal complaints and interviewed lawyers, advocates, bystanders and experts to understand how on-the-ground operations have unfolded this summer and where the points of contention are. Border Patrol agents were driving down West Olympic Boulevard in Montebello — a largely Latino community — when surveillance footage captured their white SUV make a U-turn and pull into the driveway of a tow yard at 4:32 p.m on June 12. As Homeland Security Investigations special agent Nicholas DeSimone later wrote in a federal criminal complaint, the operation was not preplanned but rather part of a “roving patrol”— a controversial tactic that lawsuits link to racial profiling and was widely used in the Los Angeles area after the raids started in June. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong that plaintiffs had documented an “overwhelming record” showing the government “has a policy and practice of conducting so called roving patrols throughout this district to stop individuals without ever making a particularized, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion that the person is in the United States in violation of U.S. Past lawsuits show that Border Patrol agents determined on the fly who to stop, based on the slightest behaviors, from people slowing abruptly, speeding up, avoiding eye contact or not sitting upright. On June 17, Vivaldo Montes Herrera was pushing a trash can across the parking lot of the plaza he’s cleaned for years when he spotted a marked Border Patrol truck, out on a roving patrol, coming straight toward him. As Border Patrol captioned an Instagram video last month: “When they run, we chase.” Across the country, people now wrestle with the question of what do when confronted by immigration agents: Do I run? In her ruling, Judge Frimpong did not order the agents to stop the practice but expressed misgivings about it, noting that the government hadn’t explained “why fleeing upon seeing unidentified masked men with guns exiting from tinted cars without license plates raises suspicion.” Adrian Martinez, 20, with his mom Myra Villarreal, left, describes how his neck was bruised and his leg was injured after he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) In El Monte, when Montes Herrera was being detained, Adrian Martinez, a worker at a Walmart in the plaza, tried to intervene and was arrested alongside him. Martinez said he heard agents laughing at Montes Herrera and calling him “dumb for running.” Advertisement “We wouldn’t have chased him if he wouldn’t have ran,” Martinez recalled the agents saying. Immigration agents said arrests in June and July often stemmed from “consensual encounters.” Advertisement “The individuals were free to walk away and terminate the encounter, decline to answer questions and refuse to provide requested identification documents,” Kyle Harvick, who heads patrol for the El Centro Sector, said in a court declaration defending the practice used across the Southern California raids. “While some of the individuals encountered freely answered questions about their names and place of birth and provided identification documents, others refused to answer questions and/or walked away from the encounters without any further interaction.” Civil rights and immigration lawyers say that armed, masked men forcefully barking questions to vendors or people in a Home Depot parking lot is anything but a consensual interaction. “If they are showing up in places with that display of force and authority and surrounding the people they’re trying to talk to, that’s no longer a consensual encounter,” said Eva Bitran, a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California. In his declaration, Harvick said certain businesses, including car washes, “have been selected for encounters because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations.” Advertisement At least 58 car washes have been hit, some of them more than once, according to the Clean Carwash Worker Center, which has been tracking the raids. During a hearing last month, Frimpong called some of the locations that agents had hit “general” and “not necessarily associated with not having status.” “As they said, bus stop, car wash, tow yard — maybe they’re correlated with people who are low-income or have low income-occupations, maybe they’re correlated with race or ethnicity, but they don’t seem to be correlated with status,” Frimpong said.

He spoke in “a sort of Eastern European accent,” Starr testified, but lapsed at times into “other unidentified accents.” As they waited for her husband to return, the masked man rambled about himself. “He said he had a number of tools to get us to cooperate,” Starr testified, “but worst case-scenario, he’d leave us zip tied in the closet and burn the house down.” When the suspect brought them snacks — bananas, beef jerky and sparkling water — Starr felt the ordeal had veered into the absurd. “It just seemed so incongruous to zip tie someone in their closet,” she said, “and then bring them a bottle of Perrier.” Advertisement Left in the darkened closet, Starr testified she heard the whir of an electric drill as the intruder boarded up the doors with sheets of plywood.

Article: “Clean Air Vehicle Decals are a smart, cost-effective incentive that has played an important role driving the adoption of clean and zero-emission vehicles in California,” read a statement from Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Extending the decal program in California — or any other state — would require the approval of Congress and the signature of President Trump, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. “It seems that the only deadline that this Congress responds to are the deadlines that are set by Trump, and I really don’t see him going out of his way to extend this program.” Advertisement Why this state program needs congressional approval Federal legislation has allowed the U.S. Advertisement “Clearly in the early days of zero-emission cars, the carpool lane stickers were an important incentive for some drivers, particularly in places like the Bay Area and Los Angeles where there is major congestion,” Magavern said. “Just like a lot of other incentives, the HOV lane access through the Clean Air Vehicle Program is one of those things that drivers look to to assess the overall package of what it’s like to either go electric or to get that next electric vehicle,” said Alexia Martineau, senior policy manager for Plug In America. What’s being done to extend the life of clean air vehicle decals In an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. “Putting the brakes on this program means that starting October 1, 2025, CAV decals will no longer be valid in California, or elsewhere in the United States,” the Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement. “All vehicles will be required to meet posted vehicle occupancy to travel in carpool lanes and pay required tolls or risk receiving a citation.” According to the California Air Resources Board, there are 519,000 active decals in the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “Now that California has hundreds of thousands of zero-emission vehicles, they can take up a lot of space in the HOV lanes, and those were meant to incentivize people to carpool,” he said. In fact, sales on electric vehicles have been on the rise in the state since 2011, with the exception of stagnant sales between 2018 and 2020, according to a report published by UC Davis. The university’s Electric Vehicle Research Center conducted a survey of drivers from the start of the year until June and found that almost 30% of people said that without any state incentives, including the decal, they wouldn’t have chosen to purchase an electric vehicle, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the center. “Only 8% of the vehicles on the road are electric, and that’s not enough for you to reach the point where the vehicles are a social norm.” The Clean Air Vehicle Decal program is just one way the state is working toward its environmental goals — milestones that have recently come under attack, including California’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards. House voted to prohibit California from banning the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035 and end the state’s ability to set emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and to combat smog levels.

Article: Gavin Newsom on Thursday said UC should not bend “on their knees” to the president as university leaders negotiate with the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in frozen UCLA grants amid antisemitism accusations. Columbia will pay more than $200 million to the federal government and Brown will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce programs — in addition to promises to share admissions data with federal authorities. The remarks from Newsom were his first public comments about how UC should proceed with Trump, and the first indication — if vague — of how a UC settlement with Trump may or may not look. Advertisement The university system, run by its president and Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution of “all political or sectarian influence.” At at the same time, the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, made the remarks during a media question-and-answer period after an event about artificial intelligence workforce partnerships the state announced with Google, Adobe, IBM and Microsoft. Advertisement Asked about UC’s negotiations, Newsom said, “They’ll do the right thing.” “I have the confidence and I’ll do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.” UC and UCLA spokespeople did not immediately respond Thursday to a question about Newsom’s comments. Milliken said Wednesday that the university system was “agreeing to engage in dialogue with the federal administration” after the Department of Justice sent a letter to UC last week saying it found UCLA had violated the civil rights of Jewish students after activists erected a pro-Palestinian encampment in April 2024. Milliken said the the goal of negotiations was for all “suspended and at-risk federal funding restored to the university as soon as possible.” The grant suspensions affect research into areas including neuroscience, clean energy and cancer. Pam Bondi said on July 28 that UCLA would pay a “heavy price” for acting with “deliberate indifference” to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since Oct. It is in our country’s best interest that funding be restored.” Advertisement In a campuswide letter Wednesday, UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said the grant suspensions were “devastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation.” Times staff writer Taryn Luna contributed to this report.

Article: Fire season in California is indeed starting earlier and lasting longer in virtually every region of California than it did two decades ago, researchers have found, thanks largely to human-caused climate change. And in the Cascade Range, which runs into Oregon, fire season now begins 46 days earlier than it once did, according to a study published this week in the journal Science Advances. Advertisement “Anecdotally, those of us living here have this sense that it’s been happening sooner,” said Amanda Fencl, a Berkeley-based water specialist who directs climate science for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists and was not directly involved with the research. “This is really an important study to quantify just how soon and where it is shifting, and to what extent.” Newsletter Toward a more sustainable California Get Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation — and the solution. Although the number of people living in California has grown by roughly 27% since the early 1990s, human-ignited fires have dropped significantly during that time, enabling the researchers to rule out human-caused blazes as the source of the additional burn days. Advertisement “It’s often said we no longer [have] a wildfire season, but that wildfire season is all year, and that’s tied to warming temperatures,” said James Thorne, a UC Davis landscape ecologist who was not involved with the research. More than 220,000 acres have burned in the state as of mid-July, almost 100,000 acres more than California has seen on average at this point in the year over the last five years, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . That total does not include the 96,000 acres burned in the Gifford fire , which was 15% contained as of Thursday, nor three different fires that started Monday in Southern California that together have burned more than 2,800 acres and are not yet contained. In 2018, the year the Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed more people than any wildfire in California history, wildfire damages statewide were an estimated $148.5 billion .

Article: The “Solar for All” program was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribal groups, regions and nonprofits under the Biden administration’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27-billion program geared toward addressing climate change. “One of the more shocking features of Solar For All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through with all of the middlemen taking their own cut — at least 15% by conservative estimates,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ EPA is taking action to end this program for good,” Zeldin added, referring to President Trump’s tax and spending bill he recently signed into law. This week, Los Angeles celebrated the opening of one of the nation’s largest solar and battery power plants, the Eland facility in Kern County, which is now supplying 7% of the city’s power. The California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency were going to oversee and distribute the grant funds, which were particularly focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities and California tribes. Advertisement In a joint statement, the three agencies said the EPA’s termination of Solar for All funding “needlessly increases the cost of community solar and storage projects in California and damages California’s efforts to unleash innovation, train people for today’s energy jobs, and build clean energy projects.” Two nonprofits — the Community Power Coalition and GRID Alternatives — each had $250-million awards for separate efforts to develop community solar and multifamily solar projects across several states, including in California. Climate & Environment California Supreme Court sides with environmental groups in rooftop solar case The California Supreme Court sided with environmental groups in a Thursday ruling, saying that state lawyers were wrong in their claim that the Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives could not be challenged. Estimates were that the program would have saved low-income households $400 a year on electricity bills, created more than 200,000 jobs and eliminated more than 30 million metric tons of air pollution, according to the nonprofit Climate Power. “The Trump administration isn’t just walking away from climate solutions — they’re ripping affordable energy away from the families who need it most.” Trump — who received record donations from fossil fuel companies during his 2024 presidential campaign — is making a number of efforts to slow the transition to clean energy while encouraging the use of fossil fuels, including canceling credits for solar and wind projects by the end of 2027. Advertisement “This latest heist from the Trump administration will cause energy costs to rise, keep Americans beholden to monopolistic electric utilities, and make our grid overburdened and less reliable,” Markey said in a statement. “Trump and Zeldin’s attacks on the Solar for All program and their attempts to cancel legally-binding contracts will mean energy bills are going to continue to spike nationwide.” The program would have created more than $8 billion in overall savings across all 50 states, Markey said. “Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate,” the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency said in their joint statement. “Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects.” The Environmental Protection Network, composed of more than 600 former EPA employees, described the decision as an “abrupt and arbitrary” betrayal of public health, environmental justice and economic opportunity. “Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”

Article: The Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on “roving patrols” implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment. The restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. Advertisement The Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong’s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Lawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration’s arguments. “The brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.” Advertisement The move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck — actions some experts said appeared to violate the court’s order. “I think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.” Advertisement The Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes “manifest irreparable harm” to the government. President Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives. District and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of “Alligator Alcatraz.” But little of the president’s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.

Article: Caught in the middle are a handful of California Republicans, from relative newcomers to seasoned veterans, who represent pockets of the state from the U.S.-Mexico border to the remote forests in the northeast corner. That’s shocking.” The California gerrymandering plan taking shape behind closed doors would increase the Democratic Party’s dominance in the Golden State, adding as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats, according to a draft map reviewed by The Times. That’s what separates what we’re doing from what others are doing.” The proposed boundaries of the new congressional districts continue to shift, but the goal for California Democrats remains the same: Funnel the state’s Republican voters into fewer seats, boost vulnerable Democrats and turn some GOP-dominant districts into narrowly divided toss-ups. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) Kiley represents a sprawling district that runs along the Nevada border from Northern California to Death Valley, cutting through Mammoth and Lake Tahoe and the cities of Roseville, Rocklin and Folsom. He said the bill would “stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.” Newsom, Kiley said, is “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California.” Rep. LaMalfa said in an interview that he had seen one map that shifted his district south to include parts of Sonoma County wine country and shifted some conservative rural areas in the north in another lawmaker’s district. “I hope the weight of how bad this looks collapses on them before we even have to go through these gyrations, and millions and millions of dollars.” He said he was certain that Republicans would litigate the new map if Democrats push ahead. “If they throw me in some wine country district or some coastal district, and that throws me out, then I can go over here and finish cutting apart this tree that fell on my fence last night.” Rep. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster. Valadao represents the California district with the highest percentage of Medicaid recipients, many of whom may lose coverage because of legislation approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump. Calvert said he strongly opposes “the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians” to replace maps drawn by the redistricting commission “with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies.” Deviating from the independent redistricting process “disenfranchises voters and degrades trust in our political system,” Kim said in a statement. She said Newsom should, “for once, focus on addressing the pressing issues making life harder for Californians under his watch instead of trying to position himself for a presidential run.” Newsom this week said he was pleased to see Republican members coming out in support of independent redistricting. A spokesman for Issa declined to comment but referred to a statement from the state’s nine-member Republican delegation, which said that Trump won 38% of the presidential vote in California last year, but Republicans hold fewer than 1 in 5 of the state’s 52 House seats. Newsom, the delegation said, is trying to wrest power from the independent redistricting commission and “place it back into the hands of Sacramento politicians to further his left-wing political agenda.” “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want,” the statement said.

Article: Stanford University’s student newspaper is suing the Trump administration, claiming the threat to deport foreign students for speaking out against Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza is chilling free speech. Some Stanford Daily writers, who are foreigners in the country on student visas, have even turned down assignments to write about unrest in the Middle East because they’re afraid they’ll be deported. The suit accuses Trump administration officials, specifically Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, of placing their statutory authority to deport a foreign visa holder whose beliefs they deem un-American ahead of the constitutional right — guaranteed by the 1st Amendment— to free speech. “When a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights,” the newspaper’s lawyers wrote, “the Constitution prevails.” Advertisement Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, scoffed at the lawsuit, calling it “baseless.” “There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here,” she said in a statement. The lawsuit — which was filed by the 133-year-old student newspaper, not by the university itself — is the most recent salvo in an increasingly bitter fight between Trump and many of the nation’s elite universities. Advertisement His weapon of choice is to threaten to withhold billions of dollars in federal research grants from institutions that refuse to adopt policies on issues such as diversity, transgender rights and Israel that fall in line with his Make America Great Again ideology. Critics call Trump’s campaign an attack on academic freedom, but fearing massive budget cuts, several Ivy League schools — including the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and Brown — have recently cut deals with the Trump administration in an attempt to limit the damage. The Stanford Daily’s lawsuit focuses on two unnamed students, John and Jane Doe, who the paper’s lawyers say began self-censoring out of a well-founded fear of having their visas revoked and being deported. Rubio has claimed that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows the secretary of State to revoke a noncitizen’s legal status if it is decided the person’s actions or statements “compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” Rubio used that interpretation to justify the March arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. Referencing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — which includes Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — the slogan is viewed as a call for freedom and self-determination by Palestinians. As a result, Doe’s profile appeared on the Canary Mission, a pro-Israel website that creators say is devoted to outing “hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews.” Department of Homeland Security officials have acknowledged they consult the website’s profiles — most of which are of students and faculty at elite universities — for information on people worthy of investigation. As a result, since March, Jane Doe has deleted her social media accounts and has “refrained from publishing and voicing her true opinions regarding Palestine and Israel,” the lawsuit claims. John Doe has participated in pro-Palestine demonstrations, has accused Israel of genocide and chanted, “From the river to the sea.” But after the Trump administration started targeting campus demonstrators for deportation, he “refrained from publishing a study containing criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza,” according to the lawsuit.

Article: A rapidly growing wildfire straddling the Ventura-Los Angeles county line Thursday afternoon triggered evacuations in and around Piru and Castaic amid a major heat wave that officials warned could foster extreme fire growth and behavior. Advertisement “Fire conditions are settling down for the night, the air is cooling off, and we continue to have an aggressive fire attack happening, coordinated between ground resources and helicopters,” said Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “So while we certainly have a significant number of people still evacuated and a significant number of residents that are under evacuation orders, we continue to make good progress.” That progress led to an evacuation order in a section of Val Verde being downgraded to an evacuation warning Thursday night, he said. As midnight approached, 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd. “In the area of the fire that’s in Ventura County, we do have four evacuation zones, but it’s a very sparsely populated area, very rural area, and the fire is moving east out of that area,” he said. Both the Ventura and Los Angeles counties’ fire departments were responding to the scene, where crews were facing temperatures up to 100 degrees with wind gusts up to 25 mph, according to the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office. “Our firefighters are working tirelessly in the heat and steep terrain to make that happen.” In Ventura County, evacuation orders were issued for the Lake Piru Recreation Area as well as the communities of Camulos and Piru. (KTLA-TV) Advertisement Fixed-wing firefighter airplanes were grounded shortly around sunset per aviation regulations, but firefighting helicopters will remain at the scene overnight working with ground crews to try to get a handle on the blaze, Dowd said. “We have a quick [water drop] turnaround time because of our proximity to Lake Piru.” Dowd said he was cautiously optimistic that crews would make strong progress on the fire overnight as winds and temperatures died down. “There are light winds that are pushing the fire eastward, but we’re not seeing a significant wind-driven fire like we saw with Palisades or the Eaton fire or the Mountain fire in Ventura County,” he said. “Those were wind-driven fires with long-range spotting that was occurring, and this is much more of a fuel- and terrain- and temperature-driven fire.” California Canyon fire: Evacuation zones, road closures, shelters The Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castaic near the Los Angeles-Ventura county line. “It’s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn’t reach them.” The L.A. “Similar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter in place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,” agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement.

The federal reports, prepared by hundreds of volunteer scientists, are subject to extensive peer review and detail how climate change is affecting each region of the United States so far and provide the latest scientific forecasts. Advertisement Wright accused the previous reports of being politically biased, stating that they “are not fair assessments of the data.” “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said. His statements came after the Trump administration in April dismissed more than 400 experts who had already started work on the sixth National Climate Assessment, due for publication in late 2027 or early 2028. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in March proclaimed the administration was “driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” In his CNN appearance, Wright said the previous climate change assessments — including the 2018 report prepared during Trump’s first term — were not “a reasonable representation of broad climate science.” Advertisement “They have been more politically driven to hype up a real issue, but an issue that’s just nowhere near the world’s greatest challenge,” he said of climate change. “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears — that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was among the authors dismissed by the administration. “This is one more alarming example of the Trump administration’s ongoing and highly politicized effort to obfuscate scientific truth to further its dangerous and deadly pro-fossil fuel agenda,” Cleetus said. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, noted in a post on X that the previous National Climate Assessments were authored by hundreds of scientists who were leading domain experts in their fields.

One of California’s most influential labor organizations endorsed redrawing the state’s congressional maps to counter President Trump’s effort to push Republican states, notably Texas, to increase his party’s numbers in Congress in next year’s midterm election. Gavin Newsom and many of the state’s Democratic leaders, would ask voters to temporarily change congressional district boundaries that were drawn by an independent redistricting commission four years ago, with some conditions. “California Labor is unified in our resolve to fight back against President Trump’s anti-worker agenda.” Redistricting — the esoteric redrawing of the nation’s 435 congressional districts — typically occurs once every decade after the U.S. Population shifts can result in changes in a state’s allocation of congressional seats, such as when California lost a seat after the 2020 census the first time in the state’s history. Advertisement The ballot measure being pushed by Newsom and others would allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles if Texas approves a pending measure to reconfigure districts to increase Republican-held congressional seats in that state. The California Federation of Labor is committed to spending several million dollars supporting a mid-decade redistricting ballot measure, on top of what it already planned to spend on competitive congressional races next year, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the strategy.

Article: Last week, the Department of Insurance ordered the state’s home insurer of last resort to answer allegations that it has handled smoke damage claims illegally, which has prompted policyholder complaints and multiple lawsuits. Advertisement “I’ve spoken with wildfire survivors who would rather lose their homes to flames than endure the stress and confusion of navigating smoke damage claims,” Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. “This is unacceptable.” Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan, said in a statement that the insurer “welcomes the opportunity to engage in this process” and has been working with the department over the past year to “update and clarify its policy language around smoke damage.” Business In landmark decision, judge rules California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy is illegal A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has ruled that the California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy, which limits claims payments by the insurer of last resort, is a violation of state insurance law. The FAIR Plan’s handling of smoke damage claims has angered homeowners who say that instead of being promptly offered industrial hygienic testing for toxic substances and professional cleaning services — even after homes were infiltrated by soot, ash and other fire debris — they were told to try to clean up their properties and given lowball offers to close their claims. Advertisement However, advocates for policyholders have questioned why it took so long for the department to take the action after its own probe in 2022 found 418 violations of state law and the insurance code. Eaton and Palisades fire survivors suffered needlessly under FAIR Plan smoke damage denials because Lara failed to act on the findings of his own investigation,” said Joy Chen, chief executive and co-founder of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a community group formed after the Jan. Harvey Rosenfield, an attorney and founder of Los Angeles advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and a critic of Lara who has accused him of being too chummy with the insurance industry, said the commissioner could have sought an injunction in civil court to halt the alleged illegal claim denials years ago. “It raises the question of Lara’s true intentions, though he could prove us all wrong.” The order to show cause filed by the department accuses the FAIR Plan of denying smoke damage claims through its reliance on illegal policy language adopted in 2017 that requires the claims to show “permanent physical changes” to property. Sanchez said the department has taken a number of escalating legal actions against the FAIR Plan, including holding a 2022 investigative hearing and issuing a May 2025 legal directive declaring the “permanent damage” policy language unlawful and unenforceable. The department’s action follows a landmark pretrial ruling in June by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge that found the language to be illegal in a 2021 case involving a former Mono County homeowner. Since that ruling, however, the plan has continued to reject smoke damage claims based on the 2017 policy language, contending that the decision did not set a precedent, said Dylan Schaffer, an attorney who handled the case. “It remains to be seen whether the department’s action that should have been taken in 2022 will do anything to help consumers, including those impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires,” he added. Amy Bach, an attorney and executive director of United Policyholders, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it is important that the department work with Schaffer and other attorneys who have already filed lawsuits against the plan.

Article: In his efforts to look like a “fighter” ahead of a potential run for the presidency in 2028, he’s willing to ignore democratic rules in pursuit of political aims, setting aside the state’s independent redistricting system to counter Texas Republicans’ proposed partisan gerrymander. In 2008 and 2010, California voters passed ballot initiatives that gave the power to draw the state’s legislative and congressional district lines to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a 14-person independent body composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people who are registered with neither of the two major parties. Potential commissioners go through an extensive vetting and selection process (which the state Legislature participates in) and are prohibited from many forms of political activism, including donating to candidates, running for office or working for elected officials. Since the latest redistricting, in 2021 — triggered as usual by the constitutionally mandated decennial census — the map crafted by the commission has survived legal and political challenges, and the current districts are set to be in place through the next round of redistricting in 2031. Now Newsom wants to prematurely redraw the lines and craft his own partisan gerrymander for the November 2026 midterm elections, wresting control of the process away from the commission and giving it instead to the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. Last week, Newsom confirmed that he will call a special election to get voter approval for this end-run around the commission, but even dressed up with a vote, this is cynical politics, not democracy, at work. Greg Abbott and President Trump are backing to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress from that state, and in turn, to enhance the party’s chances to retain control of the U.S. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) calls the Texas action a “Trumpian power grab,” and Newsom assails it as the “rigging of the system by the president of the United States.” (Recent public opinion research conducted by Newsom’s pollster revealed that the public is more likely to support a California redistricting maneuver if the fight has Trump, not Texas, as the central villain.) But two wrongs don’t make a right. A key difference between the proposed line redrawing in Texas and the California plan is that the former, however brazen, is legal and precedented, while the latter specifically contravenes California law and the expressed will of the state’s voters. To add insult to injury, the cost of the special election to ratify the scheme is estimated to be about $60 million in Los Angeles County alone, with statewide costs likely exceeding $200 million.

Article: When a federal court appointed a receiver to take over a Mississippi jail plagued by inmate deaths three years ago, the Hinds County supervisors decried the move as “utterly unaccountable” to voters. Advertisement “I’m looking at it as help — much needed help,” said Supervisor Janice Hahn, whose district includes Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, which has been the site of a riot, escape attempts and multiple overdoses since it reopened in 2023. Advertisement Last month, Bonta said the county’s “repeated, constant and chronic” failure to adhere to the settlement left him with no choice but to ask the court to approve a receiver for the county’s two remaining halls. “I don’t believe a receivership approach will be successful without changes to the staff and the employment agreement that governs how these halls operate.” Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey has been the site of a riot, escape attempts and multiple overdoses since it reopened in 2023. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) On July 29, the three unions representing probation employees sent a letter to Horvath accusing her of “reckless, union-busting rhetoric” and ignoring state law that protects members’ collective bargaining rights. “If the Court appoints the Receiver, we will hold him accountable to state law and to the terms of our contract.” Absent some sweeping new power, Probation Chief Guillermo Viera Rosa warns, the receiver will run into the same obstacles as every other chief. “Simply having a receiver saying do X, Y and Z isn’t going to change anything unless they have explicit powers that I haven’t had or that the county hasn’t been able to implement because of, for example, the civil service or unions,” Viera Rosa said. “If it’s simply additional oversight and putting another person to simply have a separate budget, but no new ideas or powers, then it’s a critical mistake.” Advertisement And potentially a costly one. County Chief Executive Fesia Davenport warned her bosses at a meeting last week that handing financial control to a receiver could have “significant impacts” to the county’s finances, which already have been wrecked with federal cuts , a $4-billion sex abuse settlement and costly labor negotiations . “If a receiver can cut through the red tape that has stalled past reform efforts, then it’s a step worth taking.” Soon after taking the job in 2023, Viera Rosa diagnosed his ailing department with a “call out culture.” Employees scheduled to work often didn’t show up for their shifts. “You’re going to have to give the receiver the authority to suspend contracts — whether it’s employment contracts, union contracts, broad authority to suspend civil service rules — just a tremendous amount of authority to really move the needle on this.” Advertisement That’s what happened in Cook County, the only juvenile detention facility in America to go into a receivership. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Bonta’s office said in a statement the receiver will have the power to hire and fire staffers and “all other necessary decisions for compliance.” “If the receivership is approved, the receiver would have the power to negotiate or renegotiate contracts and to petition the court to waive a contractual obligation in certain circumstances,” the his office said in a statement. “Even in a federal receivership, they’ve sort of left the contracts alone,” said Don Specter, a senior staff attorney with the Prison Law Office, whose Supreme Court case focused on inadequate medical care for California prisoners led to a receiver.

Article: A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who shot a man in the back in 2021 will not face criminal charges, according to records made public by the district attorney’s office late last month. Los Angeles County prosecutors found there was “insufficient evidence” to prove Deputy Yen Liu was not acting in lawful self-defense when he shot Adrian Abelar at a Rosemead auto body shop four years ago, firing a round that fractured several vertebrae and nearly paralyzed him, according to court records and Abelar’s attorney. Deputies were responding to reports that Abelar — a convicted felon who could not legally possess a firearm — had threatened to shoot several people at the auto body shop. In video from the incident, deputies can be heard shouting, “Gun!” right before Liu closes in on Abelar, whose right arm is clearly outstretched and empty at the time Liu opens fire. Advertisement “Since one reasonable interpretation of the evidence leads to the conclusion that Liu acted in response to an apparent danger, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Liu did not act in self-defense when he shot Abelar in the back,” prosecutors wrote in a 10-page declination memo made public in late July. There were only four other cases since 2013 in which more than two years elapsed between a deputy-involved shooting and a charging decision being made by prosecutors, according to a 2021 report by the L.A. He claimed the investigation was “purposefully stalled for more than two years.” Advertisement Liu has returned to active duty and is assigned to the Temple Station, where he worked when the shooting occurred, according to Nicole Nishida, a sheriff’s department spokeswoman. “The guy clearly does not have a weapon in his hand and the deputy who is on top of him draws his firearm, jams it in the guy’s back and fires it immediately upon contact,” said Ed Obayashi, a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff’s deputy who advises police departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents. According to recordings made public by law enforcement, Doktor said Abelar arrived at his shop that day demanding car repairs because he was fleeing from the cops due to an active murder warrant. While living on the street, Abelar was arrested last May on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, resisting arrest and having a forged driver’s license, records show.

So what did Wasserman, a prominent Democratic donor who in recent months has thrown some cash at Republican committees, do in front of people who want to rain holy hell on his hometown? If that wasn’t groveling enough, Wasserman was grinning after Trump joked about not using an autopen to sign the executive order creating the task force — a jab at President Biden. the way he did this summer, Trump responded, “We’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?” With the Games happening in a presidential election year, Trump would love nothing more than to traipse around an L.A. And you definitely don’t entrust kiss asses like Wasserman — I’m still not sure what he did to deserve his powerful LA28 gig, except being the grandson of the late Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman — with calming down someone like Trump.

Article: Gavin Newsom calls the “labyrinth of manual verification,” which involves Medi-Cal recipients proving every six months that they are working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours per month. It’s relatively uncharted territory, and it’s not yet clear how the rules will shake out for the 5.1 million people in California who will be required to prove that they are working in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid. Advertisement After the 2026 midterm elections, millions of healthy adults will be required to prove every six months that they meet the work requirement in order to qualify for Medicaid. The rule applies to those whose income is between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty limit, a group that became eligible for Medicaid when the program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. But those programs were brief, overturned by the courts and weren’t “a coordinated effort among the states to figure out what the best practices are,” said Ryan Long, the director of congressional relations at the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that has become influential among congressional Republicans. Arguments from liberal groups that people will lose healthcare are a “straw man argument,” Long said: “They know that the public supports work requirements for these benefits, so they can’t come out and say, ‘We don’t support them.’” A poll by the health research group KFF found this year that 62% of American adults support tying Medicaid eligibility to work requirements. The poll also found that support for the policy drops to less than 1 in 3 people when respondents hear “that most people on Medicaid are already working and many would risk losing coverage because of the burden of proving eligibility through paperwork.” In June, Newsom warned that some Californians could be forced to fill out 36 pages of paperwork to keep their insurance, showing reporters an image of a stack of forms with teal and gold accents that he described as “an actual PDF example of the paperwork that people will have to submit to for their eligibility checks.” Many Californians already are required to fill out that 36-page form or its online equivalent to enroll in Medi-Cal and Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace. Two years ago, the state made healthcare available to people who were working at least 80 hours per month and earned less than the federal poverty limit (about $15,000 for one person or $31,200 for a household of four). The Medicaid program has cost more than $100 million so far, and of that, $26 million was spent on health benefits and more than $20 million was allocated to marketing contracts, KFF Health News reported. Advertisement The Inland Empire agency that provides Medi-Cal coverage for about 1.5 million people in San Bernardino and Riverside counties estimated that 150,000 members could lose their insurance as a result of work requirements. Jarrod McNaughton, the chief executive of the Inland Empire Health Plan, said that California’s 58 counties, which administer Medi-Cal, “will be the ones at the precipice of piecing this together” but haven’t yet received guidance on how the eligibility process will be set up or what information people will have to provide.

Article: Arrests of undocumented immigrants have dropped significantly across the Los Angeles region two months after the Trump administration launched its aggressive mass deportation operation, according to new figures released Wednesday by Homeland Security. “Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. White House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around “sanctuary” jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. “If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote, “they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.” It’s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: “From the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.”

Right now, no law prohibits employers and plan sponsors from offering these kinds of assets, but they are required to act as fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal and ethical duty to protect investors: Traditionally, plan sponsors have been extremely conservative about including anything that could get them sued, especially when it comes to deciding what investment options are available through your 401(k). Most of the groups advocating for these assets to be included in 401(k) investments are the ones that would benefit from gaining access to the roughly $12.2 trillion currently in retirement funds.

Article: President Trump alleged that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America—the two biggest banks in the US—refused to handle more than $1 billion of his money after his first term, the president said in an interview with CNBC yesterday. Per the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s claims could serve as the catalyst for an executive order as early as this week designed to punish the banking industry for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. Reputational risk Per Reuters, during the Biden administration, regulators were able to ask banks why they were providing services to Trump in spite of the “reputational risk” issue, which is a way for banks to turn away customers or entities who could hurt the bank’s image. Thus, this is one area where Trump and the banks now appear aligned: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Trump is “after the right thing, which is the laws, rules, and regulations around our industry.” Zoom out: While banks legally can’t say “your money is no good here” because of political affiliation, they can say it if, for instance, someone has been convicted of fraud.

Article: Like a straight-A student living the nightmare that their teacher called their parents to say they’re on the verge of failing math, famously conflict-avoidant Switzerland is racing against the clock to get out of the fight President Trump picked with the country last week. The trade barrier—which one Swiss newspaper called the country’s biggest defeat since France beat it in the Battle of Marignano in 1515—came after a phone call between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter last week. The country’s leaders are now getting flak for bungling talks and are working to change Trump’s mind before the new tariff rate is slated to kick in on August 7. Switzerland’s claim to fame as a top-shelf goods supplier is what made it a target for some of Trump’s heaviest tariffs: The land of bougie chocolate and watches has the 13th-largest annual trade surplus with the US, amounting to $38 billion last year. Though a chunk of that comes from Swiss gold exports (the country is a major transit point for the precious metal), some local business leaders blamed the country’s pharma giants for inspiring Trump’s ire. Even though pharma is currently exempt from the import duty, Switzerland-based Novartis and Roche’s US subsidiary Genentech were among the major pharma purveyors that POTUS recently gave 60 days to lower drug prices. But Switzerland’s business minister Guy Parmelin said the country could try to win Trump over by offering to buy more American liquefied natural gas or ramping up investments in the US economy.—SK

Age representation is gradually growing (e.g., The Sims released its first kit focused solely on elderly styles and accessories in May), but accessibility issues, like font size and controller design, make it difficult for some older folks to dive into gaming.

Article: Swing and a miss: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) says the US added just 73,000 jobs in July, and those gains were almost entirely propped up by two industries: healthcare and social assistance. Another lost job: Hours after the revised data was released, President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing the Biden appointee of manipulating the numbers without providing evidence for that claim. The president called Powell a “stubborn MORON” who should be put “out to pasture,” and said if Powell doesn’t cut rates soon, the Fed’s Board of Governors should assume control of the central bank. And another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, announced Friday that she’s leaving her role at the central bank even though her term is not over, opening the door for Trump to appoint someone more inclined to cut interest rates.—BC

Article: Last night, with a self-imposed midnight deadline looming for the end of the tariff pause, meaning countries that hadn’t reached a new trade deal with the US would get turned into a pumpkin slapped with higher tariffs, President Trump rolled out new tariffs to be imposed on imports from dozens of countries—but pushed off their implementation until Aug. A senior US official told Bloomberg that the rates fell into roughly three groups: 10% for countries where the US has a trade surplus, 15% for those where the US has a small trade deficit, and higher for countries with a large deficit or that didn’t strike deals: For countries that did make deals–including Japan, Britain, the EU, Indonesia, and South Korea—the order appears to reflect the tariffs that were agreed to, even though the details are still being worked out. Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25%, but that this would exclude any goods covered by the trade deal he brokered with Canada and Mexico during his first term. There’s no getting around them: The order imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods deemed “transhipped,” which means made in one country with components from another to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile…a federal appeals court appeared skeptical yesterday of Trump’s legal power to set tariffs without congressional approval while hearing the Justice Department’s appeal of a federal trade court’s May ruling that struck down the tariffs (but was then halted).

The industry veteran inherited a mess worse than a lavatory after a 14-hour flight when he stepped into the role last summer, amid regulatory scrutiny over safety lapses and just before a nearly two-month strike in the fall that hampered assembly lines and, consequently, Boeing’s cash flow. But Ortberg said recently that 2025 can be the company’s “turnaround year.” In Q2, Boeing ramped up production of its best-selling 737 Max aircraft to 38 per month—the legal limit set by federal regulators—and it aims to get permission to bump that to 42 soon. Looking ahead…to convert its $522 billion order backlog into more revenue, the planemaker needs the government to green-light more of its plane models, but the target for getting the new Boeing 737 Max 7 and Max 10 certified was pushed back from this year to 2026.

The law is mainly intended to shield minors from pornography and anything that promotes eating disorders or self-harm, but critics aren’t sure this is the best way to go about it: Some sites ask for selfies, videos, or photos of IDs to check users’ ages, which has privacy experts worried about potential data breaches, since an age verification platform used by TikTok, Uber, and X left personal info exposed last year, according to 404 Media. Some tricksters have gotten creative: Gamers who didn’t want to hand over a facial scan figured out that they could get past Reddit and Discord’s age-verification checks by pointing their phone cameras at the face of the main character in Death Stranding.

Article: The parents in 19 Kids and Counting probably wish they lived in China, where the government will pay families $500 a year per baby until the child turns three, state media reported yesterday. The cash is meant to be a birthing incentive to remedy the country’s ongoing population decline, which threatens to undermine its economy: China’s fertility rate dropped from 2.51 children per woman in 1990 to 1.01 last year, well below the 2.1 rate needed to maintain a stable population. Local governments in China already offer their own baby bucks incentives, with the capital of the Inner Mongolia region offering the most generous subsidy of up to $14,000 per child. The Trump administration has reportedly considered a $5,000 “baby bonus,” and the recently passed Republican tax bill included the government funding a $1,000 investment account for babies born through 2028.

Article: After an hourlong meeting, the pair emerged with what Trump called “the biggest deal ever made.” The European Union’s 27 countries will be charged a baseline tariff of 15% on most exports. Europe wanted a zero-to-zero tariff deal or a 10% rate, like the UK negotiated, but ended up with less than the 20% tariff Trump originally announced in April and the 30% rate he floated on July 12. “It is the best we could get,” von der Leyen said, acknowledging that the negotiations started from “an imbalance,” a reference to the US’ significant trade deficit with the EU. However, von der Leyen said that the 15% rate would not stack on top of industry-specific tariffs already in place, and that the deal provided “stability” and “predictability” for the EU. No written documents were immediately provided with the announcement, and more details will likely be clarified this week, but the biggest takeaways yesterday were: The 50% tariff on steel from Europe remains in place.

The legal standard could make proving Tesla’s liability difficult: As The Verge reported, it’s likely an uphill climb for the plaintiffs, since the court is using Florida’s standard, which is “whether the car manufacturer exhibited a reckless disregard for human life equivalent to manslaughter by designing and marketing the vehicle.” As for other states…few have language on the books to determine who is liable in the case of an autonomous vehicle accident. Bottom line: Should Tesla lose this case, it could hurt the company’s reputation and further damage its already flagging sales, as the company has staked its future on growing its robotaxi fleet.—DL

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — After weeks of protests following a six-alarm fire at The Cooper Apartments, dozens of tenants displaced by that fire have filed a lawsuit against the complex seeking damages. According to a press release from Varghese Summersett, the Texas law firm representing the tenants in the case, some residents have been told they'll never be allowed to access their apartment or belongings, losing irreplaceable possessions and critical documents. This is cruelty piled on top of catastrophe.” In addition to the apartment complex, the apartment owner, the property management, the electrical contractor, the owner of the electrical contractor and the electrician on site that day are all listed as defendants in the suit. “I have to live with that for the rest of my life.” Another plaintiff, Zaire Harris, described the uncertainty and stress of going weeks without basic needs or access to his home. “Fluffy words, very little action.” Attorney Katie Steele, who is representing a growing group of 49 former residents, said her clients were not only displaced but also denied basic tenant rights. "I hope we get to the bottom of what happened and how it got to be so bad." Steele has also reportedly sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction of any portions of the apartment complex in order to preserve evidence. A spokesperson for The Cooper said in a statement to WFAA, "We are reviewing the allegations in the lawsuit and are unable to comment." A resident of The Cooper Apartments, who is among the complainants in the suit, shared a lease termination notice dated July 31, 2025, which said the following: The lease is terminated, effective seven days after the date of the letter Leases terminated Aug. 7 as notice was sent July 31 Tenants cannot access the apartment to retrieve their belongings because the building is structurally unsafe, all personal belongings were destroyed in fire and the units are too toxic Tenants will be refunded pro-rated rent from the date of the fire to the lease termination date as well as all deposits All remaining personal property will be thrown away, citing it as a health and safety hazard According to the Fort Worth Fire Department, the fire was reported around 1:30 p.m.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn't distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba's speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: ATLANTA — The Detroit Lions said safety Morice Norris was in stable condition after he was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions’ preseason game Friday night against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support.” Lions coach Dan Campbell asked for prayers for the 24-year-old Norris. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back’s midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we’ve all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.” When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board.” Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. “We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone’s eyes and see that.” Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

In addition, Dallas increased the property tax exemption for seniors aged 65 and older or residents with disabilities for the seventh year in a row, raising it from $153,400 to $175,000. "This budget reflects a reimagining of service delivery, the elimination of duplications, the optimization of operational efficiencies and other measures that maintain responsiveness to the needs of the city." Budget Highlights: Keep Dallas safe by hiring 350 police recruits and retaining seasoned officers to end FY 2025-26 with 3,424 officers, the highest number since 2016. Working to provide market-based pay and step pay increases in accordance with the Meet and Confer Agreement for uniform employees, which expires in September, negotiations are underway for the new agreement. Continue with proven strategies to end street homelessness incrementally across the city, including accelerated diversion and rehousing from shelters, to prevent street sleeping with a $10 million investment to move more people inside and prevent overflow into our streets.

Article: 15 over claims that it has become "the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. Asana Partners, a real estate investment firm that owns several properties in the neighborhood — including some near the popular but controversial bar Rodeo Dallas — has filed for a temporary restraining order to have Rodeo's doors shut for the second time this week, according to court documents obtained by WFAA. Before the weekend began, Asana Partners filed the restraining order against Rodeo Ranch Texas LLC on Friday, accusing the bar of being “the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” "The wrongful activities emanating from Rodeo Dallas are egregious -- unfettered violence, drug use, displays of firearms, underage drinking, excessively loud music, massive uncontrollable crowds and murder," Asana Partners said in the original petition for the restraining order. "Deep Ellum as a whole is flourishing, but the ongoing operation of Rodeo Dallas must be immediately retrained to prevent further irreparable harm to [Asana Partners] and the entire Deep Ellum community." On Tuesday, WFAA spoke with nearby business owners and employees, many of whom celebrated the initial closure, calling it a win for the neighborhood. It's worth noting that a situation like this, where neighboring landlords file restraining orders to shutter businesses, is unprecedented for Deep Ellum, let alone a landlord locking out its tenant, which consistently ranks in the top 15 of alcohol sales for all of Dallas, according to the state. A sign was left on the door stating, "You will be missed." Managing Director of Asset Management for Asana Partners, Chris Dalton, provided the following statement on the temporary restraining order: "At today's 3pm hearing in the 44th District Court in Dallas County, Judge Veretta Frazier ruled in favor of the Temporary Restraining Order filed by Asana Partners against Rodeo Dallas. We thank and are encouraged by Judge Veretta Frazier and the 44th District Court for supporting efforts to protect Deep Ellum and the people who visit, work, and live there." Frazier listened to arguments from attorneys for Rodeo and Asana Partners Friday afternoon. "They want to pump as much alcohol into young folks as they can, and there are no concerns whatsoever for the ramifications or for anyone who lives in this community," attorney Ben Riemer said in court on behalf of Asana Partners. Dave Wishnew, an attorney for Rodeo, fought back, saying Asana Partners isn't representing the city or a community -- only business as a whole in the area and that Asana Partners is not aware of what Rodeo is doing to remedy issues with its landlord, Westdale, or the city. The city attorney of Dallas sent Rodeo a warning letter on July 30, listing several code violations that Rodeo had committed, such as operating as a restaurant rather than a bar, lacking a dance-hall license, and running a mechanical bull without a permit. Measures are in place for this weekend, and nobody is inviting crime into this business." Wishnew also stressed that the bar has no control over what people do outside of it and only inside of it, noting that over a dozen crimes the city connected to the establishment in the letter were never committed on the premises.

Article: Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. Bush said in a statement Friday night that Webster's “passion for the rule of law and for the greatness of America made him a model public servant.” President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path,” said David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, science team leader for the Hubble observations. Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles (tens of kilometers) across, but Hubble’s observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers).

Article: — A man suspected in a shooting at a Montana bar that left four people dead was captured Friday just a few miles from where the shooting happened after hundreds of law enforcement officers spent the past week scouring nearby mountainsides, authorities said. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a news conference that about 130 law enforcement officers made a hard push Thursday after getting tips that helped verify they were looking in the right area. Greg Gianforte first confirmed Brown’s capture on social media Friday afternoon, saying it was the result of what he called a “Herculean effort” from law enforcement officers across the state. The community finally would be able to sleep tonight, Anaconda-Deer Valley County Attorney Morgan Smith said, adding that the case is just the beginning for prosecutors who will be seeking to charge Brown with the killings. Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, said search teams found Brown at a structure near The Ranch Bar and that he looked to be “in pretty good shape, physically.” He was communicative and able to identify himself, Johnson said. Eric Hempstead, who owns The Ranch Bar, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) west of The Owl Bar, described an intense law enforcement presence in the densely wooded area over the last couple of days that involved search dogs and drones. Brown, who lived next door to The Owl Bar in Anaconda, served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005. The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Law Enforcement Department did not respond this week to several email and phone messages requesting records of the welfare checks Boyle said they helped conduct on Brown in the years leading up to the shooting.

Article: Thomas Bowers III, an attorney for the plaintiff, said in a statement to WFAA that this is "just another delay tactic for Jerry, who's trying to run away from facing justice." He also said he and his client are in it "for the long fight and look forward to their day in court." The lawsuit was filed in Dallas County in September 2020 against Jones and the Dallas Cowboys by a woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe, who alleged in the lawsuit that Jones forcibly grabbed her and kissed her on the mouth in September 2018. The initial lawsuit didn’t detail where the alleged incident happened, but in a refiled version of the lawsuit, she alleged it happened in the Tom Landry room at AT&T Stadium.

Article: In the video, Thalia Salinas, 23, sits surrounded by her four closest friends — Ruby Cruz, Brianna Valadez, Jackie Velazco and Desiree Cervantes — as they sing to her, celebrating another year of life. On July 25, the longtime friends were heading to the lake when, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, a Dodge Ram 4500 pulling a horse trailer swerved into oncoming traffic on U.S. "I gave each one of them their last hug, and I truly… I’m glad I did.” Ruby’s younger sister, Ana Cruz, said her final conversation with her sister came just hours before the crash. "Those were the last words that came out of my mouth that I loved.” Thalia’s older brother, Sal Salinas, remembers the constant energy and noise in their home when the girls were together. "Her favorite things to do were go to the beach, go to the lake, anything water… all five of them are regularly at her house… just watching videos, listening to music, a bunch of random laughter very loud through the walls here.” Anger over driver leaving scene without testing The driver accused of causing the crash, 37-year-old Kody Talley, was not tested for drugs or alcohol before being released from the scene, despite having what the families say is a lengthy and troubling criminal record. Commercial driving questions: At the time of the crash, Talley was reportedly driving for his father’s company, hauling a trailer loaded with horses — something the families say raises questions about whether he should have been behind the wheel at all, given his history.

Article: WYLIE, Texas — If students at Wylie High School don't comply with a new state law about the use, or more accurately, the lack of use, of their cell phones and other communication devices, they will be sent to see Student Services Secretary Beth McPherson. "I give them the top copy," she said, tearing off a duplicate receipt at her desk in a small office off the main hallway at the high school of approximately 3,000 students. Wylie ISD, like all other school districts across Texas, is working to comply with House Bill 1481, which requires all school districts and open-enrollment charter schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal communication devices (cell phones, personal iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) while on school property during the school day. "The first day I was reaching, like where's my phone," said Wylie High School junior Julia Hudgins, admitting that it was a bit of an adjustment on Thursday, the first day of the school year. "There are some people that are just on their phones 24/7, sit in the back, take naps, just do whatever," Wylie High senior Eli Martin said of previous school years. "But now that's gone, I see them like they're sitting up, they're paying attention now." School districts are making exceptions for students who might need their phones to monitor glucose levels for diabetes or need them to operate hearing aid devices.

Article: Well, the implementation of that law -- which was passed by the Texas Legislature this year -- might vary from district to district, even if the intended effect is still the same: Students won't be able to use their phones in school. Here are the policies that several larger districts in North Texas have passed: Dallas ISD The new DISD policy bans cell phone use all day and includes escalating levels of punishment for each violation: 1st violation – phone confiscated, returned to parent/guardian 2nd – returned with $5 fee 3rd – returned with $10 fee 4th – returned with $15 fee The district decided that elementary teachers will collect cell phones and secure them during the day, and secondary campuses will give students a pouch to store their devices. Arlington ISD The Arlington district announced an "Away for the Day" cell phone policy, requiring students' personal devices -- including smartwatches, cell phones and tablets -- to be powered off and "out of sight" during all parts of the school day, including class time, transition between classes and at lunch. The police comes with four levels of discipline for each time a student violates the policy, from device confiscation and contacting a parent (first offense) to in-school suspension (third offense) and then, on a fourth violation, an assignment to the district's Choices program. Plano ISD The Plano district passed a policy requiring students to have all personal communication devices powered off and stored out of sight in their backpacks from the time they enter the building until they leave for the day. Duncanville ISD Duncanville students will have to power off their devices all day, although each individual campus will decide how the devices will be stored, according to the district's policy. Allen ISD Allen students will not be allowed to use phones or other communication devices from the time they arrive at school until they leave, including passing periods and at lunch, the new policy says.

Article: DALLAS — California Congressman Kevin Kiley, R- District 3, is one of the many Republicans who doesn't agree with any effort to redistrict mid-decade, like what is happening in Texas. And now that leaders in Democrat-run states such as California, Illinois and New York, are threatening to redraw their congressional lines to ice out the GOP, many blue state Republicans such as Kiley are growing increasingly alarmed that their seats will suddenly become vulnerable. Gavin Newsom for “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California,” the Republican did acknowledge to us that the fight started with Texas Republicans.

Article: HOUSTON — Billy Howton, a former Green Bay Packers star regarded as one of the most productive wide receivers of the pre-Super Bowl era who was a founder and the first president of the NFL Players Association, has died. Because of Billy’s advocacy as our first president, today’s players have a pension, disability benefits & a voice of their own in the business of football.” Howton scored the Packers' first receiving touchdown at Lambeau Field in 1957. He holds Green Bay's single-game franchise record with 257 receiving yards in a 1956 game against the Los Angeles Rams, and when he retired in 1963, he was the NFL's all-time leading receiver in receptions (503) and receiving yards (8,459). “For my money, Howton is the toughest pass receiver to cover in the National League,” Hall of Fame safety Emlen Tunnell said before the 1958 season, which was Howton’s last with the Packers. “He was an extremely dangerous receiver and had great technique.” After seven years in Green Bay, Howton was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1959 and then to Dallas as a member of the Cowboys' inaugural team in 1960. He represented the Packers at the first NFLPA meeting in 1956 and brought with him a list of four grievances that famously included a need for clean towels, shirts and jock straps for second practices — when NFL teams held two practices a day. He was elected as the organization's first president in 1958 and threatened to bring an antitrust suit against the NFL if it didn't establish a pension plan for retired players.

Article: Gavin Newsom, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and others about GOP-led redistricting efforts in Texas and a responding redistricting effort in heavily-Democratic California. "We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all." Pelosi introduced California Gov. Newsom likewise called the Texas Democratic lawmakers' efforts and California's potential redistricting efforts bids to "defend democracy." "We are trying to defend democracy as opposed to see it destroyed district by district, and we will stand firm," Newsom said. We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people and that's the difference between the approach we're taking and the approach they're taking." Watch Friday's full press conference below Newsom said he's calling for a special election in California in November, and the California Legislature has until Aug. In response to a question about how voters can be confident California's redistricting effort would be a "one-time exception" to California's independent redistricting commission, Newsom offered the following statement: "I'd say we want to do it for the '26, '28, '30 ballots just for congressional representatives alone. What is happening in Texas, what is being pushed out by the Trump administration beyond Texas, is something we thought we would never see where people's lives, their representation, their participation is willingly stifled, violently stifled," California Assembly Member Isaac Bryan said. "This is not just about lines on the map, this is about lives on the line.” Ahead of the press conferences, the Texas House again failed to establish quorum Friday, as our sister station KVUE reported. In addition to daily fines, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that he and Comptroller Kelly Hancock have enacted a new policy to prevent the absent lawmakers from having their paycheck, or per diem, deposited electronically. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also filed a lawsuit Friday in a bid for the Supreme Court of Texas to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic state representatives who left the state. I have asked the Texas Supreme Court to declare what has been clear from the beginning: that the runaway members have officially vacated their offices in the Texas House.” In addition to filing the petition, Paxton and Burrows moved to enforce civil arrest warrants in other states.

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. Lovell and fellow astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert received renewed fame with the retelling of the Apollo 13 mission in the 1995 movie “Apollo 13" where actor Tom Hanks — portraying Lovell — famously said, “Houston, we have a problem.” In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death affected him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises.” Lovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn't display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. I measure risk.'” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “He was a member of really the first generation of American astronauts and went on to inspire multiple generations of Americans to look at the stars and want to explore,” said Bruce McClintock, who leads the RAND Corp. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn't have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA's historian. Lovell showed a “leadership role and heroic efforts in the recovery of Apollo 13.” By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: The Senate confirmed Long on a 53-44 vote despite Democrats’ concerns about the Republican’s past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after Trump nominated him. Before Long's confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS.

Article: MCALLEN, Texas — A judge on Friday was considering a Trump administration request to end a decades-old policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody that the government says is inhibiting its immigration crackdown. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.” “It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Detroit safety Morice Norris was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions' preseason game against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. ATLANTA, Georgia -- Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. "It's never good when they bring out the stretchers." With 6:31 remaining in the fourth quarter, an official announced the game had been suspended "per New York" with the Lions leading the Falcons 17-10. We agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game." Norris, a former Fresno State standout, played in eight games last season after earning a spot on the team as an undrafted rookie.

Article: That particular wave is just coming off the coast of Africa, meaning that even if it were to eventually impact the U.S., it wouldn't be for another 10 to 12 days, giving us plenty of time to keep a watchful eye on it. August 3 There is now a low chance for development over the eastern Atlantic as a tropical wave is expected to move off the coast of Africa in the next day or two. July 29 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms and two named storms, the Atlantic Basin remains quiet for now with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 28 Update While the central and eastern Pacific basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements." One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times - Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 - with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame - thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions - and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission - immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell - that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Hanks posted a tribute to Lovell on Instagram Friday, writing, "There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive - and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites Friday morning. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they "are deteriorating." "It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it's willful," said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," where a lawsuit alleges detainees' constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump's tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

READ RELATED: Judge Lina Hidalgo's 'penny tax proposal' fails to pass; Commissioners Court meeting turns to chaos Hidalgo invited several children to attend the meeting, which devolved into commissioners arguing with and reprimanding Hidalgo. Ramsey said he feels it's the commissioners court's responsibility to "explore every option for ensuring our meetings remain professional and productive, including, if warranted, the potential removal of a court member." According to Texas state law, the county judge can be removed for incompetency or misconduct, but Ramsey acknowledged such a move would "involve significant, important, legal and procedural steps." ABC13 reached out to Judge Hidalgo regarding Ramsey's comments, but there has been no response. The decision to remove or keep an elected official is one that should be made by the voters through the electoral process."

Article: A shooting outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters on Friday left a police officer dead and officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency shaken. Citing a senior law enforcement official, The New York Times reported the shooter, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was fixated on the Covid vaccine, which he blamed for his health problems. In response to the shooting and reports of White’s motivations, newly appointed CDC Director Susan Monarez convened an online all-hands meeting of the agency division that focuses on vaccines — the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It is not fair to all of you who’ve given so much to contribute to public health,” Monarez told employees during the meeting Saturday, according to a recording reviewed by MSNBC. One said they felt like “sitting ducks.” As the leaders spoke, dozens of staffers posted messages in the meeting chat, many naming Kennedy, who oversees the CDC at the Department of Health and Human Services, citing his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines and vilifying the health agencies he now leads. One employee described the shooting as “the culmination of ongoing animosity toward CDC and the work that we do — not a one-off incident.” Another named Kennedy in a comment that drew dozens of supportive emoji reactions, writing: “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation. In videos from anti-vaccine conferences between 2013 and 2019, he likened the agency’s vaccine work to “fascism” and “child abuse,” called it a “cesspool of corruption” and said it was filled with profiteers. At a 2013 conference, when asked about why the CDC had failed to acknowledge the autism epidemic (which he falsely linked to vaccines), Kennedy said it was like the Holocaust. During the pandemic, Kennedy repeatedly framed the CDC and other HHS agencies as “corrupt,” falsely suggested Covid-19 was a “bioweapon,” and lied about the dangers of Covid vaccines, calling them “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” “The hatred RFK and his allies have spent their lives stoking puts a target on the backs of anyone in public health,” said one senior official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the agency and so they could speak critically about Kennedy. Monarez called it “a good question” and said the CDC had been in “constant communication” with his office and that “more will be coming.” Kennedy did post a message of support to the CDC from his HHS account shortly after the meeting. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.” The shooting marks a low point in an already dark period for public health.

Article: Temperatures will hit the triple digits in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys on Thursday, while interior regions of Los Angeles County will see temperatures in the 90s, according to the National Weather Service. California California fires are burning and incoming heat wave could make things worse A widespread heat wave is expected to intensify fire concerns across California as temperatures rise and landscapes further dry out. “A slight cooling trend is [forecast for] Friday through the weekend but temperatures will remain above normal away from the immediate coast well into next week.” Advertisement The sustained hot weather will continue to dry out vegetation, increasing the risk of wildfire starts and worsening conditions around blazes already burning across Central and Southern California, including the state’s largest this year: the 96,106-acre Gifford fire in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, quickly grew to more than 1,000 acres, prompting evacuation orders in Piru, Castaic, Val Verde and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles county fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by onshore winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour, according to Cal Fire and the National Weather Service. Conditions on Thursday will be even hotter in the Inland Empire and inland areas of San Diego County, where the weather service has issued regional heat advisories through Friday evening. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, grew to 600 acres in a little over an hour prompting evacuation orders in nearby communities of Piru, Castiac, Val Verde, and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles County fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by on shore winds, according to Cal Fire. “We’ll have pretty gusty onshore winds, anywhere from 15 to 25 miles an hour, with gusts to 20 to 40 across the interior locations each afternoon and evening, strongest across the I-5 corridor, Antelope Valley and southwest Santa Barbara County coast,” Black said. “With that, we’ll have an extended period of elevated fire weather risk.” California is already on pace for the worst wildfire year in recent history, driven by several large fires in Central and Southern California — including the Gifford fire and the devastating January firestorms in Los Angeles County. Advertisement As of Thursday morning, the Gifford fire was 15% contained, according to federal officials, after hot conditions and continued fire growth challenged firefighters and triggered additional evacuation orders and warnings for rural communities near the Los Padres National Forest.

Article: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel’s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in what local media called one of the largest anti-government protests in recent months following 22 months of war. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Health officials said that 20 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours, as the criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food to reach people in the besieged enclave. ‘Shut the country down’ Hostages’ families pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government amid new fears for the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” WATCH: Netanyahu’s Gaza takeover won’t end Hamas influence in the region, Mideast analyst says A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel’s decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel’s decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel’s plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites In the north, Israeli fire killed at least nine and wounded over 200 as people sought aid entering Gaza through the Zikim crossing, said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service in the area. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn. More deaths from hunger Gaza’s Health Ministry said the new adult deaths from malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours brought the total to 114 since it began counting such deaths in June.

Article: WASHINGTON — The White House is considering inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Alaska, where President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, according to a senior U.S. But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were "decisions against peace," adding, "They will not achieve anything." The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday. The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. The White House had made a Putin meeting with Zelenskyy a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. If Zelenskyy were to travel to Alaska, it is not clear if he and Putin would ever be in the same room, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. The surge in diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine comes after Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow ahead of a deadline on Friday that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. Zelenskyy said defiantly on Saturday that Ukrainians "will not give their land to occupiers." Trump said Friday that between Russia and Ukraine, "there'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both." Administration officials were working on Saturday to try to gain support for a potential ceasefire from Ukrainian government and European leaders.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

Article: The order came at the request of AG Ken Paxton, whom O’Rourke accused in a separate lawsuit of going on a "fishing expedition, constitutional rights be damned." (The Texas Tribune) Former U.S. Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton’s request for a temporary injunction, barring O’Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton’s contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either “directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators” to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for “unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators’ Constitutional duties.” O’Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O’Rourke said Paxton was trying to “make examples out of those who fight so that others won’t.” “Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, [President Donald] Trump and Abbott have on power in Texas,” O’Rourke said. With few tools to stop the map’s passage through the Republican-dominated Legislature, Democrats called on their one failsafe, leaving the state to deny quorum, or the minimum number of members required for the chamber to function. But this time, Republicans have gone on the offensive, filing lawsuits to cut off financial support; asking Illinois courts to enforce Texas’ civil warrants; investigating members and donors for bribery; and, in an unprecedented move, asking the Texas Supreme Court to expel lawmakers who left.

Article: Having finished 15 points adrift of their city rivals last season, Rangers are already a one behind Celtic before Brendan Rodgers' side play their game in hand in Aberdeen on Sunday. If Rangers get through their Euro tie after Tuesday's second leg against Plzen, they will postpone the league match against St Mirren on 24 August to prepare for the play-off tie, which means they could be seven behind by the time Celtic visit Ibrox the following week. It can be argued they were fortunate to escape Motherwell with a point last weekend, while Rangers had to play the final half hour against Dundee with 10 men before captain James Tavernier came off the bench to rescue another with his late spot kick. A "disappointed" Martin admitted: "There was just general lethargy and no speed in the first half." After last week's draw at Fir Park, Martin had questioned the mentality of some of his players, complaining that some "have to drop their ego", and was delighted with the reaction against Plzen. This time, he was "pleased with the response of the team when we went down to 10 men and we could've won the game in the end, but the mentality has to come from the very first kick of the match". Martin accepted some of the blame, admitting: "In hindsight, I should've made some changes to inject that energy in the team, but I explained my decision before the game and maybe I could've changed that now the game is finished. "We're learning about the group all the time, so that's a lesson learnt today." BBC pundit and former Rangers striker described them as "Jekyll and Hyde" but pointed out that the same happened under the previous two team bosses - Philippe Clement and Barry Ferguson - last season.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. WATCH: ‘The Devil Reached Toward the Sky’ documents motivation and development of the atomic bomb About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn’t distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” READ MORE: At 80th anniversary of Hiroshima bombing, survivors fear lessons may be forgotten as nuclear threat rises In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba’s speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: European officials presented their own Ukraine peace proposals to the United States on Saturday as President Donald Trump prepared for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war. The Wall Street Journal said European officials had presented a counterproposal that included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken and that any territory exchange must be reciprocal, with firm security guarantees. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke and pledged to find a "just and lasting peace" in Ukraine and "unwavering support" for Zelenskyy, while welcoming Trump's efforts to end the fighting, a Downing Street spokesperson said. "The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle." He had earlier rejected any territorial concessions, saying "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." The Trump administration is considering inviting Zelenskyy to join the U.S. "Ukraine's future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now," he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer.

In a brief post on the social media platform X, UEFA called the former national team member “a talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times”. The United Nations says that more than 1,000 people have been killed near aid distribution sites and aid convoys in Gaza since the launch of the GHF, a United States- and Israel-backed aid distribution system, in late May.

Article: Mars rock found in Niger sells for millions in New York - now the country wants answers 40 minutes ago Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save EPA The Martian meteorite found in Niger went on display in New York before it was auctioned "Brazen! He makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer. At first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find – less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour. Reuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth Sotheby's strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa). An Italian academic article published last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Niger's Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by "a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed". Meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. According to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was "sold by the local community to an international dealer" and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo. "As with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved." A spokesperson added that Sotheby's was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and "we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised". The academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the country's vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Niger's cultural and natural heritage – including anything that has fallen from outer space - returned. But, according to a 2019 study by international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. AFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks Morocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites - more than 1,000 - found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara. More than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a "Saharan gold rush", fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours. It's a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but it's the same state in all our countries." Prof Sereno hopes that the Sotheby's sale will prove a turning-point - firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly "if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it".

Article: What it means to be 'culturally' Irish in 2025 is complicated - as Ed Sheeran has shown 38 minutes ago Share Save Fergal Keane • @fergalkeane47 Special correspondent Share Save BBC He sang wistfully of the English town that shaped his life. But I can't wait to go home." Ed Sheeran grew up in Framlingham in Suffolk and its rolling hills and magnificent castle inspired his hit single, Castle on the Hill. "I can be allowed to feel a connection to a place half my family is from." Yet he was accused of being Irish "when it suits him" by one poster. Another wrote on X: "I've seen B*Witched live and have watched a couple of Gaelic football games, which I think gives me an even more legitimate claim to be culturally Irish than Ed Sheeran." Getty Images Ed Sheeran said: 'I class my culture as Irish. "That doesn't mean to say he doesn't like or love being British, that is part of him too." Certainly it is much easier to speak of an Irish identity in Britain now that there is peace in Northern Ireland. As the Belfast South MP, Claire Hanna, who is now leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told parliament during a St Patrick's Day debate in 2022: "Many are moving on from the traditional binaries of the past and embracing the 'or both' part of the Good Friday agreement, not feeling that they have to decide between being British and Irish if they do not wish to do so." Sheeran's declaration raises this point once again, and prompts the deeper question of what cultural "Irishness" really is today. Identity versus citizenship Professor Linda Connolly, director of sociology at Maynooth University in County Kildare, argues that Ed Sheeran's statement is about an idea of identity that is bigger than where you were born or what you write on a census form. I am also a Cork, Kerry and Waterford person' (County Cork pictured) For many unionists, staunch political loyalty to Britain and the Monarchy, sits alongside a deep attachment to the land they have lived on for hundreds of years. There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup. Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles Everyone has their own menu of what being "culturally Irish" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously. It runs a wide spectrum of styles, influences, opinions and genres - from Oasis (born in Manchester to Irish parents), the rappers Kneecap, novelist Sally Rooney, the Irish actress of Nigerian descent Demi Isaac Oviawe, the London-born playwright Martin McDonagh of The Banshees of Inisherin fame. Getty Images Noel and Liam Gallagher were born in Manchester to Irish parents The core members of The Beatles all had Irish grandparents or great grandparents, prompting John Lennon to tell a concert in Dublin: "We're all Irish." That was in 1963 – some 62 years before Ed Sheeran's declaration. There are many voices too from the Irish Protestant tradition in Ulster – the singer Van Morrison and the novelist Jan Carson, who has written about growing up in an evangelical Christian home, and says she now feels "much more ease and comfort with an Irish identity than a British one". Getty Images Culturally Irish can mean a sense of a particular landscape - like the world of "the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting," evoked by Shane McGowan of the Pogues. Today, it is undoubtedly easier these days for a big mainstream star like Sheeran to embrace an Irish cultural identity in Britain than it would have been several decades ago. I think of the powerful song Nothing But the Same Old Story by Paul Brady, about an Irishman in Britain during the 1970s, amid the ongoing IRA campaign: "In their eyes, we're nothing but a bunch of murderers." Cross-fertilisation of cultures Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including legendary BBC presenter Terry Wogan and musicians such as U2, Thin Lizzy, Sinead O'Connor, the Pogues "and now Ed Sheeran!" Yet all of these icons are building on the foundations laid by the unacknowledged millions who came to Britain over many centuries. In those days, most Irish immigrants found expression of their culture in the ballrooms of places like Kilburn in northwest London, or the Astoria in Manchester, or the Irish pubs which often catered to clientele from a specific county. For two millennia there are records of the Irish trading, settling, and inter-marrying in Britain; they shared a common language with western Scotland and the Isle of Man, and a Druidic culture with the rest of Britain. Getty Images Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including the late Sinead O'Connor One of the bestselling songwriters of early 19th century Britain was Irishman Thomas Moore. His story typifies the often complex nature of cultural relationships: he was a champion of Irish liberty, but his great song "The Minstrel Boy" – written for rebels fighting Britain – is played by the band of the Irish Guards at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day. "The physical distance between Ireland and Britain has diminished in the Ryanair era… It seems to me also that Irish migration to Britain is now more likely to be temporary - people may come for a few years, then go home - whereas previously it was a more permanent departure." 'I'm an Irishman, and a Londoner - and much else too' I should declare an interest. Fergal Keane today, alongside a photo of him as an aspiring young folk singer back in Limerick in the 1980s The Irish language and music is an essential part of my cultural makeup. But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: "And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here." My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. 'The old battle of identities is far from finished' The nature of identity is evolving - in Ireland it is absorbing the influences of other cultures, but also influencing those cultures. Professor Nic Dháibhéid hopes the prominence of Irish cultural identities in Britain will prompt a greater interest in the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly among the under-25s who, as she sees it, "will have no memory of the Troubles, and so there is an even greater need to ensure that there is good mutual understanding between the people on our two islands." The big British audiences for Kneecap, to take an example, didn't happen because young people had a sudden awakening about the problems of life in nationalist west Belfast. Press Association The Derry Girls phenomenon is real, says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city It is important to recognise that the cultural influence can be polarising. One member of the band, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. "The Kneecap phenomenon is real, as is the Derry Girls one," says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, also referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city in the 1990s. I watch them navigate the challenges and opportunities of different and overlapping identities, encouraging them to follow James Joyce's advice and fly past any barriers others put in their way.

Article: "These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties," Serena says, "but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it." Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. "If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round." But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The "functional beverage" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could "prevent, treat or cure disease" were a step too far. Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. "In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks." Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. "I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option." Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, "crack on", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a "therapy session or a massage at the end of the month". "I'm ADHD," Emily says, "so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down." TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said

Article: 41 minutes ago Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save Universal Pictures/Prime Video The whole film shows either Ice Cube's computer screen or his face as seen on the monitor's camera Film critics have delivered a verdict: the new version of War of the Worlds – which stars Ice Cube as a man who must save humanity from an alien invasion without leaving his desk – is bad. 'Verges on parody' Lon Harris, executive producer of the This Week in Startups podcast, stoked the conversation this week when he posted: "Dipping below like 5% on Rotten Tomatoes has basically the same appeal to me as breaking 90%. "I watch a lot of movies, there's so much content coming out, and most of it is bland and forgettable." Harris was intrigued enough to watch War of the Worlds, and it duly lived down to his expectations. "It's very silly, Ice Cube's solo performance just reacting to things on his laptop screen verges at times on parody and frequently made me laugh, and there's a whole subplot involving Amazon drone deliveries that's so on-the-nose it's almost unbelievable that they included it," he says. "That's more interesting than just 'another alien invasion movie' to me." After its initial battering, one critic has now taken pity on War of the Worlds, having enjoyed watching it. It's certainly stupid, but it's also a great deal of fun." That write-up, which concluded that the "movie is a mess, but an uproarious one", was deemed positive by Rotten Tomatoes so has nudged the film's Tomatometer score up from 0% to the giddy heights of 4% at the time of writing. Getty Images Samurai Cop is famously bad but built up such a fanbase that it got a sequel 24 years later Truly atrocious movies are preferable to those that are simply forgettable, according to Timon Singh, who set up the Bristol Bad Film Club a decade ago. "In comparison, Samurai Cop is technically a terrible film, but it's 90 minutes of pure enjoyable terrible acting, awful fight scenes, and once you've seen it, you're never going to forget it. "Whereas you'll probably forget Transformers: The Last Knight while you're watching it."

Those claims – and the app's sudden surge in popularity – wiped $600bn (£446bn) or 17% off the market value of chip giant Nvidia, marking the largest one-day loss for a single stock in the history of the US stock market. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen referred to the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment," a reference to the Soviet satellite that had kicked off the space race between the US and the USSR more than a half century earlier. Bloomberg via Getty Images Shares of Japanese semiconductor-related companies extended a late January drop after the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek prompted a selloff in US tech stocks Still relevant It has now been six months since DeepSeek stunned the world. Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that "with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model". When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based. In online forums, users explain how to run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China - a workaround they believe can protect their data from being shared surreptitiously. "China was seen as playing catch-up in large language models until this point, with competitive models but always trailing the best western ones," policy analyst Wendy Chang of the Mercator Institute for China Studies told the BBC.

Article: Man's anger over number plate mix-up parking penalty 33 minutes ago Share Save Dan Martin & Ben Carr BBC News, Leicester Share Save Richard Lynn Richard Lynn said his vehicle was recorded entering the car park - but another with a nearly identical number plate was clocked leaving hours later A man was wrongly issued with a parking charge after his car was mixed up with another vehicle with a nearly identical number plate. Richard Lynn said that on 18 March 2024, he paid £1.70 to park for about 30 minutes in Rushton's Yard car park in Ashby, Leicestershire, but later received a demand for £165 from solicitors representing private firm Horizon Parking. The 53-year-old said photographic evidence, provided by the company, showed his Hyundai entering the car park - but a Kia with an identical number plate bar one letter leaving nine hours later. Supplied Horizon Parking provided photos showing Mr Lynn's car (left) with its number plate starting FH6 - and another car with an FP6 registration Reflecting on the situation, Mr Lynn said: "It's ridiculous. "The result of this is that I received a pretty nasty letter, threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay a fine I should not have been issued with in the first place." On 25 March 2024, Mr Lynn was sent a letter demanding £85 - £51 if he paid within 14 days. However, he said he only became aware of the matter in July this year - when he received a letter from solicitors acting on behalf of Horizon Parking demanding £165. Mr Lynn said he moved house in December 2022 but said he had, in error, not notified the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) of his change of address until some time in "early 2024".

Article: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposts video of pastors saying women shouldn't vote toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reposted and praised a video interview of a self-described Christian nationalist pastor whose church doesn't believe women shouldn't be allowed to vote. Doug Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, said during the interview with CNN that, "Women are the kind of people that people come out of." "The wife and mother, who is the chief executive of the home, is entrusted with three or four or five eternal souls," he continued. In his repost of the interview on the platform X, Hegseth added, "All of Christ for All of Life." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told NPR in an emailed statement on Saturday that Hegseth is a "proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches," which was founded by Wilson. In the CNN video, a congregant in Wilson's church explained that her husband "is the head of our household and I do submit to him." A fellow pastor also said that families should vote as a household, with the husband and father casting the vote. Andrew Whitehead, a sociology professor at Indiana University Indianapolis and an expert on Christian nationalism, told NPR the goal for Wilson and his followers is to spread these ideas across the country – and ultimately make them enforceable. "It really does matter if the Secretary of Defense is retweeting a video with very particular views about whether women should be able to vote or serve in combat roles or if slavery really isn't all that bad," Whitehead said.

Article: Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home’s front yard Officials plan to seek the death penalty for a Tennessee man charged with killing 4 TITPONVILLE, Tenn. -- Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home's front yard on Thursday. Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge. The Dyer County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that a caller reported a minivan or midsize SUV had dropped the infant at a “random individual’s front yard.” The sheriff’s office later said they were working with investigators in neighboring Lake County, where four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds. Hours before Tuesday's arrest, Jackson Police posted a roughly 20-second video surveillance clip showing someone they said was Drummond wearing camouflage and carrying a firearm, trying to enter the door of an unspecified building. Jackson Police Chief Thom Corley said the calls from the public helped officers arrest Drummond, who had been staying in a vacant building near the woods where he was taken into custody.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior FBI official who served as acting director in the first weeks of the Trump administration and resisted demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in the Jan. The circumstances of Brian Driscoll’s ouster were not immediately clear, but his final day is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The news comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of current director FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked international counterterrorism investigations in New York and had also commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys manpower and resources to crisis situations. Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination.” Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about President Donald Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. Wildlife biologists and a state veterinarian who visited the trail near Tupper Lake, New York, on Wednesday saw that the moose was severely emaciated and showed other signs of advanced disease. In addition, information gathered from this animal will help DEC better understand and manage moose in New York,” Jacqueline Lendrum, director of the agency's Division of Fish and Wildlife, said in a prepared statement. Jennifer Bloodgood of the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine said a necropsy will be performed to help authorities understand the cause of the moose's decline and to provide more information on threats to the large mammals in New York state.

That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AKP via AP) BANGKOK -- Three Thai soldiers on patrol were wounded Saturday when one stepped on a land mine in territory along the border with Cambodia, Thailand’s army announced. The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side.” The Ottawa Convention, also called the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, is an international agreement banning the weapons’ use, and both Thailand and Cambodia have committed to it. A statement from Thailand’s foreign ministry said the incident confirmed the Thai army’s findings “that new land mines are being laid in blatant violation of international law.” It also noted this was the third such incident in less than a month. Winthai Suvaree, charged that Saturday’s mine explosion constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems.” A statement issued in response by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied Thailand’s allegation that Cambodia had laid new mines. “We have not, and will not, plant new land mines,” said the statement, noting that Cambodia is a party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty Convention, “and has an internationally recognized record of removing, not deploying, these indiscriminate weapons." It noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970.

Britain’s unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in the three months through May, the highest level in four years, signaling that previous tax increases and uncertainty about the global economy are weighing on employers.

Article: Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades Crown-of-thorns starfish are seen at Tern Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef in far North Queensland, Australia, on Jan. (Australian Institute of Marine Science via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say. But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths — caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change — have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday. The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world’s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said. Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest — and fourth ever recorded — mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world’s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. Coral reefs are considered a “unique and threatened system” due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. That report said “tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.” The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s “suggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.” “Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.

Article: Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir, accusing them of promoting a "false narrative" and "secessionism." SRINAGAR, India -- Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir that they say propagate “false narratives” and “secessionism” in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019. It said such books played “a critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.” The action was taken following “investigations and credible intelligence” about “systemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature” that was “often disguised as historical or political commentary,” it said. A year earlier to that, police arrested a college lecturer on charges he gave his students an English exam filled with questions attacking a crackdown on demonstrations challenging Indian rule in the region. “It only exposes the insecurities and limited understanding of those behind such authoritarian actions, and the contradiction in proudly hosting the ongoing Book Festival.” Banning books is not common in India, but authorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have increasingly raided independent media houses, jailed journalists and sought to re-write history in school and university textbooks to promote the Hindu nationalist vision of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: Texas Democrats have prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump Texas Democrats who left state prevent vote, for now, on Trump's efforts to add GOP House seats State Reps. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. The Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. “We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the Democrats “un-Texan.” “Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said. Hours after Monday's halted House session, a gaggle of Democrats — state lawmakers who left and members of Congress whose lines would be redrawn — mocked Abbott as the weak figure in this battle.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions.

Article: (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) When Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to try to prevent the Republican-led Legislature from redrawing the state's congressional districts, it marked the latest episode in a long national history of gerrymandering. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: “The Constitution supplies no objective measure for assessing whether a districting map treats a political party fairly.” The Supreme Court noted that partisan gerrymandering claims could continue to be decided in state courts under their own constitutions and laws. In a 2023 case from Alabama, the high court said the congressional districts drawn by the state's Republican-led Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting strength of Black residents.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

Article: Republican Nate Morris warmed up a recent crowd of party faithful by gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey Mitch McConnell's legacy comes under fire in Kentucky race to replace him in the Senate Tech entrepreneur Nate Morris, a candidate for United States Senate, talks with reporters at the annual Fancy Farm picnic Saturday, Aug. -- Republican Nate Morris had deftly warmed up a crowd of party faithful, gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey — from hardscrabble childhood to wealthy entrepreneur — when he turned his attention to the man he wants to replace, Sen. While bashing Kentucky's longest-serving senator at a GOP dinner on the eve of Saturday's Fancy Farm picnic, a tradition-laden stop on the state's political circuit, Morris was cut off in midsentence by a party activist in the crowd, who noted that McConnell isn't seeking reelection and pointedly asked Morris: “What are you running on?” Morris touted his hard line stance on immigration and defended Trump's tariffs as a boon for American manufacturing. “Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell told a Republican crowd that included Morris at a pre-picnic breakfast in Mayfield. McConnell endorsed Trump in 2024, but in a biography by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, released shortly before the election, McConnell described him as “a despicable human being.” Morris, who started a waste management technology company, says the senator has been insufficiently loyal to Trump and allowed festering issues like immigration and the national debt to grow worse during his years in Senate leadership. "It seems, to me, maybe just maybe, Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago." McConnell had his customary front-row seat for much of the event but wasn't there for Morris' remarks.

Article: (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) FILE - Bill Clinton, Founder and Board Chair of the Clinton Foundation & 42nd President of the United States, speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative, on Monday, Sept. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) Former President Bill Clinton plans big changes for this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting “by necessity” to address the changing landscape for global development and increasing needs driven by war and climate disasters. “We need to redefine how we show up, how we work, and how we find ways to honor our common humanity,” Clinton wrote in a letter to the CGI community released Thursday. “This September, our goal will be to connect dots across issues, expose the consequences, and confront the complicated issues in front of us.” Since its launch in 2005, the CGI annual meeting has served as a platform for political, business and philanthropic leaders to announce new initiatives or new financial support for existing programs addressing the world’s problems. At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women’s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better. This year’s meeting — held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton — will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. “This year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.” In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI hopes to close those gaps with a series of “Leaders Stage Sessions,” where representatives from a wide range of organizations – including GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan, Center for Disaster Philanthropy CEO Patricia McIlreavy, AFL-CIO President, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten -- will work together to create new initiatives. “Now is the time to stand up and roll up our sleeves — and do our part to reverse the trend lines and begin charting a brighter future,” Clinton said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump holds up the signed document after signing the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency, in the East Room of the White House, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

Claudio Lavenia | Getty Images "Loud luxury" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out "quiet luxury" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. "We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment," Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last month. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus." The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piano have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags. "There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance," Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email. Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench. Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was "reigniting brand desire" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as "a luxury brand with broad universal appeal."

Wwd | Getty Images Gucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label. Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a "first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. "Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again." New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Venetta and the famously out-there Versace. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time," group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month. The big divide Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand.

Article: — Stetson Bennett passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns in a strong start to the preseason, leading the Los Angeles Rams to a 31-21 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday night in new Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer's debut. Blake Corum rushed for short TDs to cap the Rams' first two offensive drives behind Bennett, the two-time national champion at the University of Georgia attempting to secure his job as the Rams' third-string quarterback for another season. Looking much sharper than he did a year ago against the Cowboys, Bennett went 16 for 24 and hit Cody Schrader and Brennan Presley for touchdowns in the second half. Joe Milton passed for 143 yards before injuring his elbow in the fourth quarter of a solid debut with the Cowboys, throwing a touchdown pass to Rivaldo Fairweather with 8:48 to play. The Rams didn't even play second-string quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo — but Matthew Stafford, who didn't participate in training camp due to a back injury, went through a lengthy workout before the game ahead of his anticipated return to practice Monday. Schotty starts The game was the head coaching debut for the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant coach with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Although he has no intention of showing much of his offensive tendencies in the preseason to start his first year as Dallas' play-caller, Schottenheimer got right to work in the other privileges of his new job: He unsuccessfully challenged a sideline catch by the Rams' Xavier Smith on a 39-yard pass from Bennett on the game's opening drive. Offensive interference Lamb didn’t stay out of the action entirely despite being in street clothes: He got a penalty in the second quarter when an official ran into him as he strayed into the white paint on the sideline.

Article: WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country's safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. A crackdown came after an assault The catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.

Monarez said Friday that she was “heartbroken by today’s attack.” In a letter to employees on Saturday, Monarez said that “Monday will be a remote workday for all employees in order for us to conduct a security assessment before returning to the office.” “Law enforcement is still assessing damage to CDC buildings, but it is a relief to report that no CDC employees or visitors were harmed, and we are grateful for the swift response of CDC Security and local law enforcement,” she said. Asked if it was believed that the shooter targeted the CDC, Dickens said Friday the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that he could not say more about a possible motive. He referred to the suspect as “a known person that may have some interests in certain things, that I can’t reiterate right know with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.” A neighbor of the suspect, who said she knew him very well and requested anonymity, told NBC News that White had expressed anti-vaccine sentiments to her on multiple occasions.

One extreme case: Irena Green of Florida had to spend a week in jail in May after minor HOA violations snowballed into a lawsuit, then into a warrant for her arrest. In Texas last summer, at least one resident was getting brown lawn warnings from her HOA while also receiving reminders from her utility company not to exceed water limits—both of which carried potential fines. Homegrown efforts to redo lawns so they need less water also haven’t gone over well—even when local governments encourage it: A Long Island village recently tried to sue one of its residents for $2,000 after she used her town’s $350 native plants grant to re-wild her yard, which the village mayor called “hideous.” (They compromised with a 4-foot cap on the garden’s height.) Clover and moss are becoming more popular as low-maintenance grass lawn alternatives, but HOAs usually categorize them as weeds that could warrant a fine.

Changing landscape An increasing number of communities are trying to keep gas-powered leaf blowers off the streets, according to USA Today: California has a statewide ban on selling them, though many cities there take it a step further and prohibit using them at all. On the flip side, Texas and Florida have passed statewide laws to prevent gas-powered leaf blowers from being banned, ensuring your right to have an emergency back-up Ghostbuster costume this Halloween.

Article: Europe allies say Ukraine peace talks must include Kyiv 31 minutes ago Share Save Stuart Lau BBC News Share Save EPA Macron, Zelensky and Starmer held a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv in May European allies have rallied behind Ukraine in a renewed surge of support, insisting that any peace talks with Russia must include Kyiv. "The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine," said a joint statement issued by the leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland and the European Commission. Late on Saturday, a White House official said that Trump would be willing to hold a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky - but for now, it remains just the two of them, as initially requested by the Russian leader. Trump has previously suggested that he could start by meeting only with Putin, telling reporters he planned to "start off with Russia." But the US president also said that he believed "we have a shot at" organising a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky. Whether Putin would agree to this is unclear - he has refused several opportunities to hold direct talks, and the two leaders have not met face-to-face since Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago. Speaking on Friday, Trump also suggested that there "will be some swapping of territories" in order for Moscow and Kyiv to reach an agreement - to which Zelensky reacted strongly. still impose the idea of 'exchanging' Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing but more convenient positions for the Russians to resume the war," he added defiantly. CBS, the BBC's US media partner, has reported that the White House is trying to sway European allies to accept an agreement that would include Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, and keeping the Crimean Peninsula.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Sponsor Message CDC shooter identified The Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter, but authorities haven't said whether he was killed by police or killed himself. "This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia." Kennedy reaches out to staff "We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose," Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." toggle caption Mike Stewart/AP Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a "Dear colleagues" email, and called for his resignation. Sponsor Message "Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC's workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust," said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration. Opponents say officials' rhetoric contributed Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. "When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains." A request for comment from Vought's agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the "physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers," said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. Sponsor Message Nancy Hoalst, who lives on the same street as White's family, said he seemed like a "good guy" while doing yard work and walking dogs for neighbors, but he would bring up vaccines even in unrelated conversations. "He emphatically believed that." But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: "I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC." Slain officer leaves wife and 3 kids Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and "quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism," DeKalb County said. Growing security concerns Senior CDC leadership told some staff Saturday that they would do a full security assessment following the shooting, according to a conference call recording obtained by the AP. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to "the misinformation, the disinformation" that "caused this issue." It is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted.

Article: In the first six months of the year, real (that is, inflation-adjusted) consumer spending, the main driver behind business cycles and robust economic expansion, barely grew, after rising 3 percent last year. When overall growth falls that sharply, the labor market tends to follow, which is precisely what happened: Job growth, at 35,000 per month on average between May and July, is dangerously close to stall speed. In the ’70s, stagflation was caused not by an unconstrained president but by “exogenous shocks,” meaning big, unexpected disruptions originating from events outside the country and exacerbated by the inaction of the Federal Reserve to offset them.

In announcing the list on Tuesday, the federally appointed government of the Indian-administered region called the works “secessionist literature” that were “disguised as historical or political commentary” but promoted a “culture of grievance, victimhood and terrorist heroism.” The order makes it illegal to circulate, possess or access the texts in the valley, under threat of years in prison.

Article: A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective.” By STEVE PEOPLES Associated Press , LINLEY SANDERS Associated Press , and HYOJIN YOO Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective,” according to a poll that finds considerable pessimism within Democratic ranks. Republicans are more complimentary of their party, although a small but significant share describe the GOP as “greedy” or say it is generally "bad." The poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July reveals warning signs for both major U.S. adults held a dim view of both parties, with about 4 in 10 using negative attributes, including words such as “dishonest” or “stupid." But nearly nine months after Republican Donald Trump won a second presidential term, Democrats appear to be harboring more resentment about the state of their party than do Republicans. About 15% described it using words like “weak," or “apathetic,” while an additional 10% believe it is broadly “ineffective” or "disorganized.” Only about 2 in 10 Democrats described their party positively, with roughly 1 in 10 saying it is “empathetic,” or “inclusive.” An additional 1 in 10 used more general positive descriptors. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to describe their party positively, with many also using straightforward ideological descriptors like “conservative.” About 4 in 10 Republicans used positive attributes to characterize the GOP, making general mentions of words such as “patriotic” or “hardworking,” or offering associations with the word “freedom.” Samuel Washington, 65, of Chicago, said he typically votes Republican. About 2 in 10 Republicans said something negative about the party, including phrases such as “greedy,” “for the rich” or “corrupt.” Republican Dick Grayson, an 83-year-old veteran from Trade, Tennessee, said he is “disappointed” by his party's fealty to Trump. Among other things, he pointed to the price tag of Trump's tax-and-spend package, which will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. He said he is ready for a serious third party to emerge before the next presidential election, pointing to Elon Musk's new “America Party,” which has been slow to launch.

Article: Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine near the Cambodian border on Saturday, the Thai army said, days after the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire halting last month's deadly five-day conflict. One soldier lost a foot and two were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine while patrolling an area between Thailand's Sisaket and Cambodia's Preah Vihear provinces, the army said in a statement. The foreign ministry said Bangkok would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty, to which both are signatories, that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty. The country is a "proud state party" to the Ottawa Convention against landmines and has cleared more than 1 million mines left from decades of war, the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that Thailand's accusations risked undermining the spirit of the ceasefire. Bangkok and Phnom Penh have quarrelled for decades over undemarcated parts of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was its colony. The July 24-28 clashes, the worst fighting between the countries in more than a decade, involved exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties that killed at least 43 and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides. The fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to let observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
