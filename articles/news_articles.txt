Article: Zelensky leaves White House unscathed as he buys more time 2 hours ago Share Save Vitaly Shevchenko Russia editor, BBC Monitoring Reporting from at the White House Myroslava Petsa BBC Ukrainian Service Reporting from at the White House Share Save Watch: Key moments from Zelensky, Trump White House talks The optics could not have been more different this time. At his opening appearance in the Oval Office, Zelensky spoke little - or maybe he was not keen to, fearing that what he had to say was different from what Trump wanted to hear. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron both said a ceasefire in Ukraine should be the next step, even though Trump had argued that it was not necessary before a more permanent solution is found. Getty Images What we heard from the leaders suggests that their discussions behind closed doors focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and prospects for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin. At an earlier news conference outside the White House, he said security guarantees could include a $90bn (£67bn) deal between Kyiv and Washington to acquire US weapons, including aviation systems, anti-missile systems and other weapons he declined to disclose. The Ukranian leader, however, was more willing to talk about his possible meeting with Putin, telling reporters he was ready to meet directly with his Russian counterpart, and if Moscow agreed, Trump could join the negotiations.

Article: Hamas source says group agrees to latest Gaza ceasefire proposal 9 hours ago Share Save David Gritten BBC News Rushdi Abualouf Gaza correspondent, in Istanbul Share Save Reuters Hamas has agreed to the latest proposal from regional mediators for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel, a source in the Palestinian armed group has told the BBC. It would see Hamas free around half of the 50 remaining Israeli hostages - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - in two batches during an initial 60-day truce. It is unclear what Israel's response will be, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said last week that it would only accept a deal if "all the hostages are released in one go". In a video released after the reports of Hamas's approval emerged, Netanyahu did not comment directly but said that "from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure." The Israeli military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, meanwhile said it was at a turning point in the 22-month war, with the "focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City". It came as witnesses on the ground in Gaza City reported that Israeli tanks backed by air and artillery strikes had made a surprise advance into the southern Sabra neighbourhood, and surrounded schools and a UN-run clinic sheltering hundreds of displaced people. Netanyahu announced Israel's intention to widen its offensive and conquer all of Gaza - including the areas where most of its 2.1 million Palestinian residents have sought refuge - after indirect talks with Hamas on a ceasefire deal broke down last month. A Hamas delegation led by the group's chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, has been in Cairo since last week meeting mediators who see a window of opportunity for a new agreement. Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, also visited the Egyptian capital to "apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible", Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said. Speaking during his own trip to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching a ceasefire to alleviate the deep humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory. Watch: BBC Chief International correspondent Lyse Doucet on the aid trucks awaiting clearance at Rafah border On Monday evening, a Hamas source told the BBC that the group had submitted a written response to mediators saying it agreed to the ceasefire proposal without any amendments or conditions. Witkoff proposed a 60-day truce that would see the release of 10 living hostages by Hamas and the bodies of 18 other hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. On Sunday night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv to demand that their government agree a deal with Hamas to end the war now and bring all the hostages home. The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be." Reuters Sunday's demonstration in Tel Aviv demanded an immediate deal to secure the release of all the hostages

Article: 'No-one comes for us': The women trapped in Afghanistan's mental health system 7 hours ago Share Save Mahjooba Nowrouzi BBC Afghan Service, in Kabul Share Save BBC BBC visited a mental health centre that is struggling to cope with the number of patients High on a hill in the west of the Afghan capital, Kabul, behind a steel gate topped with barbed wire, lies a place few locals speak of, and even fewer visit. The women's wing of a mental health centre run by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is the largest of only a handful of facilities in the country dedicated to helping women with mental illnesses. Thought to be in her mid-20s, she's been here for nine years, after enduring what she describes as abuse and neglect by her family, followed by a period of homelessness. Mariam has been in this facility for nine years Their stories are far from unique at the centre, where our visit, including conversations with staff and patients, is overseen by officials from the Taliban government. No-one comes to visit, and they end up living and dying here." Years of conflict has left its mark on the mental health of many Afghans, especially women, and the issue is often poorly understood and subject to stigma. In response to a recent UN report on the worsening situation of women's rights in Afghanistan, Hamdullah Fitrat, Taliban government's deputy spokesperson, told the BBC that their government did not allow any violence against women and they have "ensured women's rights in Afghanistan". But UN data released in 2024 points to a worsening mental health crisis linked to the Taliban's crackdown on women's rights: 68% of women surveyed reported having "bad" or "very bad" mental health. Many have no male relative to provide for them - 80% of my patients are young women with family issues." The Taliban government says it is committed to providing health services.

Article: 'Ketamine Queen' to plead guilty in Matthew Perry overdose case 5 hours ago Share Save Christal Hayes BBC News, Los Angeles Share Save Getty Images A woman dubbed the "Ketamine Queen" has agreed to plead guilty of selling the drugs that ultimately killed Friends actor Matthew Perry. Perry was found dead in a back yard jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home in October 2023, with an examination finding his death was caused by the acute effects of ketamine. Sangha is one of five people - including medical doctors and the actor's assistant - who US officials say supplied ketamine to Perry, exploiting his drug addiction for profit, and leading to his overdose death. They include: Dr Salvador Plasencia and Dr Mark Chavez, two doctors who sold ketamine; Kenneth Iwamasa, who worked as Perry's live-in assistant and both helped purchase and inject the actor with ketamine; and Eric Fleming, who sold ketamine he'd gotten from Sangha to Perry.

Article: Ofcom rejects 14,000 Love Island complaints Four couples made it to the latest Love Island final in early August Ofcom said it had decided not to open a formal investigation because the negative behaviour "was not shown in a positive light", and was in line with what viewers have come to expect. The 14,154 complaints is the highest number for four years, with many about alleged bullying, abusive behaviour and misogyny - particularly in relation to a divide between some of the women in the ITV villa. "We also took into account that the format of this reality show is well-established, and viewers would expect to see highs and lows as relationships and friendships are tested." The total number of complaints is higher than the 3,500 in 2024, and is the highest for a summer series since 2021, when 36,000 complaints were submitted. Other issues to attract complaints this year included Dejon Noel-Williams' behaviour towards Megan Moore, while some viewers accused producers of manipulating islanders' emotions and using biased editing, including allegations of racism in the portrayal of Shakira. In response, ITV said: "We would take any suggestion that any editorial decisions are made based on race very seriously indeed and would refute this in the strongest possible terms." Some viewers complained about a decision to bring back Megan Forte Clarke after she was dumped from the villa.

Article: Entire church to be transported across Swedish city 6 hours ago Share Save Erika Benke BBC News, Kiruna Share Save Reuters The relocation of the church will take place over two days A landmark 113-year-old church at risk from ground subsidence is about to be relocated in its entirety - in a 5km (3 miles) move along a road in Sweden's far north. These include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts. People have to move before the infrastructure fails." The iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; £737m). "We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lampposts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway." Among the most delicate aspects of the move is the protection of the church's interior treasures, especially its great altar painting made by Prince Eugen, a member of Sweden's royal family. So will the organ with its 1,000 pipes." Reuters The church has been hoisted on wheeled transportation unit LKAB Interior parts of the church have been secured by metal scaffolding The move is much more than an engineering marvel for local residents - it's a deeply emotional moment. "The church has served as a spiritual centre and a gathering place for the community for generations," says Sofia Lagerlöf Määttä, who remembers walking into the church for the first time as a young child with her grandmother. "The move has brought back memories of joy and sorrow to us, and we're now moving those memories with us into the future." That feeling is also shared by project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, an engineer who doubles as a member of the church's gospel choir.

Article: Key takeaways from Ukraine talks in Washington 4 hours ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from the White House Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save Watch: Key moments from Zelensky-Trump White House talks President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to the White House on Monday to meet US President Donald Trump for fresh talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Several European leaders also flew to Washington to attend the meeting, days after Trump met Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a summit that failed to result in a ceasefire. Despite optimistic words by Trump and some more lukewarm assessments from his European partners, by Monday evening there were no concrete commitments to security guarantees or steps towards a peace deal. Before European leaders sat down with Trump in the East Room at the White House, a hot mic picked up remarks between the US leader and French President Emmanuel Macron. It remains to be seen how straightforward it will be to bring two such bitter enemies face-to-face at the negotiating table for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. For months, Zelensky has been pushing to meet Putin, although this was likely a way of proving his argument that Russia is not serious about pursuing peace, as he believed the Kremlin had no interest in such a meeting. A noncommittal statement from Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov on Monday night said it was "worthwhile" to "explore the possibility of raising the level of representatives" from the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in negotiations. In the past, that has been a key demand of Ukraine, which made clear it sees an end to the fighting as a prerequisite for further talks with Russia and, ultimately, for a longer-term settlement. A ceasefire could also be marginally easier to agree than a full peace deal, which would take many months of negotiations, during which Russia's assault on Ukraine would probably continue. "So, let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia." When asked to speak, Zelensky did not reiterate his previous calls for a ceasefire to be put in place. Reuters European leaders also travelled to the White House on Monday to discuss a path towards ending the war Zelensky launches charm offensive Given his acrimonious last visit to the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president went to considerable lengths to charm his American hosts - including a flurry of six "thank yous" within the first few minutes of the meeting. This time, Zelenksy was wearing a dark suit rather than his traditional military garb, which drew a gibe from Trump last time that his guest was "all dressed up today".

Article: 11 hours ago Share Save Tom Edgington and Nick Eardley BBC Verify Share Save Getty Images The visit of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for talks aimed at ending the war has put the scale of United States (US) support for Ukraine under the spotlight again. BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution. The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, according to the Kiel Institute, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine. Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed: "We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference" Getty Images BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and concluded Trump's numbers did not add up as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn. Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations. This prompted Macron - who was sat next to the US president in their Oval Office meeting in February - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans. How much has the UK given to Ukraine The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

Article: How long tubes of mud could reveal how Antarctica is changing 6 hours ago Share Save Victoria Gill, Kate Stephens and Gwyndaf Hughes BBC News Science team Share Save Elisenda Balleste The researchers worked from a vessel at a number of locations around the Antarctic Peninsula Why would anyone brave hand-numbing cold, icy winds and rough seas - sometimes working through the night - to dig up mud from the Antarctic seabed? That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling - affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. "Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time," she said. Elisenda Balleste Scientists carefully slice the sediment cores in a lab on board the ship The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes.
