Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Article: Businesses across Asia are increasingly warming up to stablecoins for cross-border transactions — a trend set to accelerate further as Hong Kong moves to legalize the use of digital tokens, experts told CNBC. Monthly stablecoin transaction volumes between businesses had surged to more than $3 billion by early 2025, from under $100 million at the start of 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Artemis from May. That has attracted the interest of major payment processors such as Visa , Mastercard , and Stripe , all of which have begun integrating stablecoin support into their payment infrastructure. Capella Hotel, a Singapore-based high-end hotel group, started allowing guests to complete transactions using digital currencies in October last year, due to "growing demand [for] secure and convenient payment option," according to its statement. The boutique handbag reseller is eyeing to expand crypto payments in its Hong Kong branch in the coming months, as well as in its Tokyo branch in the next few years. About 3% of the company's transactions are currently settled in stablecoins — a share that could climb to as much as 20% by year-end, Zhou estimates, translating into half a million Singapore dollars ($387, 512) in monthly revenue. While Beijing sticks to a conservative stance in mainland China, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, has emerged as a regulatory sandbox for Beijing with the aim of preserving its global edge in financial innovation.

Article: fans from Tokyo to Manhattan stood in line for hours to be among the first to get a Switch 2, fueling one of the biggest global gadget debuts since the iPhone launches of yesteryear. Sales within Nintendo's intellectual property-related business — which includes movies and entertainment based on the company's original games — meanwhile declined 4.4% due to a decrease in revenue from "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." Sales from Nintendo's dedicated video game platform business grew 142.5% year-on-year to 555.5 billion yen, driven primarily by a higher price point for the Switch 2, compared with that of its predecessor, according to the company. Here's how Nintendo did in the quarter ending on June 30 versus LSEG estimates: Sales of Nintendo's Switch 2 now total 5.82 million units, the company said in an update on its investor relations website Friday. Despite the bumper quarterly performance, Nintendo maintained its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 2026 unchanged at 1.9 trillion yen and 320 billion yen, respectively. The device, which launched on June 5, sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days and Nintendo expects it will hit 15 million unit sales in the current fiscal year. However, analysts at Morningstar believe Nintendo will weather the storm by increasing its overall gaming audience." "Although Nintendo's profitability is expected to decline in the short term due to higher tariff rates, the company will recoup the losses in the long term by selling more games to a larger user base," said Kazunori Ito, director of equity research at Morningstar. For its part, Nintendo said Friday that, "While there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the U.S.

Article: Cambodia "This is a good news for the citizens and economy of Cambodia to continue developing the country," Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a Facebook post on Friday after the revised table of tariffs was released. Thailand Thailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said in a post on X that the tariff rate levied on the country "reflects the close friendship and partnership between Thailand and the United States," according to a Google translation of his statement in Thai. However, he said that the government recognizes the impact of the tariffs on entrepreneurs and farmers, and has prepared "comprehensive support measures," including soft loans, subsidies, and tax measures so as to help Thailand adapt. Taiwan will also discuss supply chain cooperation and issues related to Section 232 in the future, he added, referring to the sectoral tariffs that Trump had imposed on national security grounds. 1] general tariff rate will ease and not burden our economy," according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Malay He also confirmed that Trump would be attending the 47th ASEAN summit in October, being held in Malaysia. "What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market," he said, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to local media, the country's Trade Minister Todd McClay said it seemed as though the tariff rates were targeting countries that have trade deficits with the U.S., but that the size of it was "really not significant or meaningful" in New Zealand's case. "Many of the exporters are saying they have been able to absorb the 10 percent, or in many cases pass it on, but at 15 percent it is going to start having a greater effect on our exporters," he said. On social media platform X, the country's federal council, said it noted "with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." "Switzerland has been and remains in contact with the relevant US authorities. "While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong," he said.

Article: Conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch will give President Donald Trump regular updates on his health as part of an agreement to postpone Murdoch's deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him over a Wall Street Journal article about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday. "Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health," the filing says.

Article: trade deficit narrowed in June on a sharp drop in consumer goods imports, and the trade gap with China shrank to its lowest in more than 21 years, the latest evidence of the imprint on global commerce President Donald Trump is making with sweeping tariffs on imported goods. Days after reporting that the goods trade deficit tumbled 10.8% to its lowest since September 2023, the government said the full deficit including services also was its narrowest since then. The economy in the second quarter expanded at a 3.0% annualized rate after contracting at a 0.5% rate in the first three months of the year, but the headline figure masked underlying indications that activity was weakening.

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs. But he added that "I think the devil will be in the detail." Here's what the company reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 78 cents adjusted vs. The results come after Pfizer in April expanded its cost-cutting efforts, which aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the past few years.

Article: (COMBO) This combination of pictures created on February 21, 2020 shows US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 19, 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours. so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said. Russia earlier Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying that India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia." "We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday.

Article: President Donald Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he has narrowed the field of potential future Federal Reserve chairs to four candidates, a list that does not include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The move allows Trump to install another of his appointees to the Fed Board of Governors at a time when the White House is aggressively pushing the central bank to lower interest rates. "Both Kevins are very good, and there are other people that are very good, too," Trump said, adding that Kugler's resignation "was a pleasant surprise." Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. He has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism, and there has been speculation that the president would name a "shadow chair" who could help undermine Powell until his term expires. Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility." Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

The dispute between Trump and New Delhi is being closely watched by investors after Trump threatened on Monday that he would be "substantially raising" the tariffs on India, although he did not specify the level of the higher levies. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/opinion/genetics-children-noor-siddiqui.html
Article: My guest today is the founder of a Silicon Valley startup that promises would-be parents, a new level of genetic screening for their embryos, and that looks forward to a future where most embryos, and therefore most babies, are screened and selected in advance. And just since it’s going to be important to the larger conversation, one of your views, I think, is that this kind of testing and this kind of process isn’t just for people who are older parents or who have super high risk factors or who are struggling to conceive. No, I wouldn’t assume that you would be locking us in the room, but you but you would be presenting it as a reasonable option for someone in our position to consider. And basically what’s really powerful about Orchid is that instead of getting that really tiny amount of genetic information, you’re able to actually get the entire genome 100 times the data and then use that to make these really important decisions. It’s just I think it’s just really important not to skip over this monogenic side because currently, you can’t test for that large of a set of monogenic diseases during pregnancy. So what that means on a practical level for embryos is that, for example, I’m South Asian, we have unfortunately, incredibly high rates of heart disease and heart attacks were twice as likely to die as other ethnicities. But generally, what you said before is like, you’re dealing with a clientele that is partially people who have family histories of serious genetic disorders and partially people who are what cutting edge minded Silicon Valley types like, what’s the part of the clientele that is coming to you the way that myself as a hypothetical client is coming to you. Yeah, I think that it’s I don’t I just I feel like, to be totally honest, I think it’s just dishonest to try to flatten the set of people who are using the product. So I think the first symptoms that I think she admitted to at least my dad were probably in her early seconds and then I think maybe in her mid seconds is when kind of he pushed her enough to be like, hey, I think this is something that should really be looking into. This idea that there’s this genetic lottery that’s unfolding and some people win and some people lose, and through no fault of their own, someone who I love bitterly, is it going to be able to enjoy the things like being able to see her grandkids and just things that I think and I take for granted that, hey, we’re going to be able to see into old age. But the important thing I think to understand is like for cancer, for example, as a category, we test for monogenic forms of cancer, but not all of cancer is monogenic, if that makes sense. It seemed like the most important thing for me as a future parent was that I wanted to be able to minimize the chance that my child was going to be affected by what affected my mom and what affects, unfortunately, millions of people today. Sure And the first has to do with just the process that we’ve talked about already of amplification, where you are essentially copying a full genome from a smaller sample. And so you are inevitably in doing that kind of process, going to introduce essentially potential error levels and its own form of dice rolling and Russian roulette into the test results that you get back. It’s like it’s a fear that people have is that am I unknowingly reducing increasing risk for another condition and you’re effectively saying it could happen, but it’s not the most likely scenario. Yes however, I would say that the other kind of boogeyman argument of like unknown unknowns, I just don’t find it very compelling because if our standard for any medical intervention was that we’d have to clear the bar for unknown unknowns, we would never do anything right. So when we run a clinical trial for a drug and we find that it’s effective, we don’t say, O.K, but what about in 50 years if this person like self-destructs or falls down dead right. Now that we can quantify the genetic susceptibility to disease, we can see individuals who are 4 times 3 times 15 times, 30 times the likelihood, depending on which genetic risk score that you’re looking at. From our point of view, an Orchid baby born today, who you’re trying to offer a polygenic risk score for on schizophrenia might not manifest schizophrenia until the year 2046. How powerful they are is that they can identify individuals that are anywhere from 3 to 6 to 30 times, depending on which disease it is that you’re looking at. So basically, it would be ridiculous to tell people, that, hey, we’re going to stop offering any drug because we have to wait 50 years to see if it continues to work, if it works in the population that you studied offer it because it’s clear that it works based on a reasonable standard. We provide genetic reports, and parents make their own decisions about which embryo they want to implant and whether they want to discard an Orchid actually advises against discarding any embryo for any reason. And I think that if you think about what people already do for trivial reasons, I mean, people get Botox, people get plastic surgery people do, much more invasive things that are more expensive for really trivial gain. So this question is actually already been asked, nationally to Americans, and 70 percent of Americans are in support of using these types of genetic risk scores to actually understand a risk before pregnancy. And I think one should be skeptical about applying your experience, and I’m glad that it was as easy as it was for you to the experiences of the wider range of women because I would say just from personal knowledge, there are a lot of different experiences with IVF. So the United States has a very, very high rate of cesarean sections, for instance, which are not necessarily medically indicated, but have become a source of convenience and pressure from doctors and so on that has, I think, in certain ways, warped the experience of childbearing in the US. And I think it becomes easy to see a scenario where get a certain kind of medical pressures and expectations that push people towards doing the kind of interventions you’re describing because of, again, I agree, no one is going to be locked in a room and told they have to do this. This is the expectation that the medical system imposes on expectant parents, which is why I think it’s important to think about some of the moral questions and cultural questions right associated with this kind of change. This is something Americans are comfortable with in under the existing IVF system, but they’re comfortable with it in a context where most of the people who are doing this are struggling with infertility and are in a kind of crisis environment, what you’re talking about is, doing this at a much, much larger scale. Is it if I took the trays of embryos that contain you and your husband’s embryonic children and I threw them in the river, what kind of crime have I committed. The first is about the kind of sci-fi dystopian future that a lot of people see hanging around this issue, and it relates to the fact that I think most people’s expectation is that if you can figure out what polygenic scores mean for diseases, you’re going to be able to figure out what polygenic scores mean for athleticism, intelligence, to say nothing of a whole host of superficial traits. It’s a really sad history, I think, for the last 40 years that rich people get to have babies and poor people who don’t, who can’t afford IVF, don’t get to. I think that because it Spurs such moral outrage, this idea that something that would create such an advantage, such a vastly different outcomes, I don’t think that’s something that Americans will choose to only leave to the few that can afford it. I think that even today, with the money that we have today, if we spent it more appropriately, if we spent it more in line with what people’s actual preferences are, we could already afford this for everyone in America today. And I think that if you have, enormous genetic privilege and for you to roll the dice and to get a outcome that isn’t going to lead to disease is in the cards for you, then, of course, go ahead and roll the dice. How do I make sure that my child doesn’t have to suffer in the same way that I do in the same way that my sibling does, in the same way that my parent that I’m a caregiver for does so I mean, I think sex is obviously a very beautiful thing. But I think that it’s Yeah, I think denigrating and dismissive to IVF parents and to IVF babies to say that somehow science babies are inferior to babies that are made the old fashioned way.

Article: In his first half-year in office — amid his tariff campaign, government-slashing moves and immigration crackdown — President Donald Trump has also repeatedly delivered for conservative Christians, who form the bedrock of his Republican support. His faith adviser, pastor Paula White-Cain, proclaimed that in his administration, faith “has been brought back to where it always belongs, and that is center.” Critics say he’s eroding the separation of church and state. Those most vulnerable among us are not these manipulators of Christianity that are seeking nothing but power.” Here are 10 ways Trump has repaid his supporters, particularly conservative evangelicals and Catholics: Crackdowns on transgender identity and treatment Trump has cracked down on transgender identity and medical treatment, long targets of religious conservatives. The University of Pennsylvania, under a federal civil rights investigation, modified school records previously set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by her participation. The order cites grievances voiced by conservative Christian leaders in recent years, though skeptics questioned how those grievances were portrayed and whether the nation’s most dominant religious demographic needed special protections. The commission’s announcement came at a White House prayer event at which Trump said of the concept of church-state separation, “Let’s forget about that for one time.” Evangelical ambassador to Israel Trump appointed former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee reflects the unwavering support for Israel among many evangelicals, who see it as favored by God and largely dismiss criticisms of Israel’s war with Hamas and aid restrictions in Gaza. He pledged to “carry out the president’s priorities, not mine.” Religion in the federal workplace The Office of Personnel Management said in a July 28 memo that federal employees may promote and talk about their religion with fellow employees on the job, so long as it’s not “harassing in nature.” They can display religious items at work and encourage co-workers “to participate in religious expressions of faith, such as prayer,” the memo said. Office Director Scott Kupor said federal workers “should never have to choose between their faith and their career.” Critics said this erodes church-state separation, potentially creating a hostile workplace environment. Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said “this memo encourages federal workers to abuse the power of their positions by imposing their religious beliefs on others.” Supreme Court impact Trump hasn’t made Supreme Court appointments yet this term. But his three first-term picks — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — continue to deliver for the Christian conservatives and their allies from other faiths who cheered their appointments. The high court ruled in June that Maryland parents with religious objections can pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ+ storybooks; that Tennessee can ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors; and that states can block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid money.

Article: Burt Jones over how Jones is financing his campaign as both Republicans run for governor in 2026 ATLANTA -- One of the top Republicans running for Georgia governor on Thursday sued the other leading GOP candidate, challenging the legality of the rival's campaign funding. Burt Jones in federal court in Atlanta, asking a judge to permanently cut off Jones' ability to spend money from Jones' leadership committee, a special fundraising vehicle that allows Georgia's governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders to raise unlimited funds. Carr argues that the leadership committee violates Carr's First Amendment right to free speech as well as his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that favors Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone said Jones “is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.” Jones' campaign spokesperson Kendyl Parker called Carr a hypocrite because his office in 2022 defended the same law he is now challenging. The Carr campaign tried to get the state Ethics Commission to investigate the source of a $10 million loan that Jones made to his leadership committee, but the commission declined, saying Carr failed to allege a legal violation. Carr asks the court to block Jones from giving any cash to dark money groups and making any loans to his regular campaign committee during the primary, and wants the magistrate judge to investigate where Jones' $10 million loan came from. Carr's campaign continues to voice concern that Jones could raise unlimited sums to repay his loan and then give the repaid money to his candidate committee to spend in the primary, warning that such laundering would destroy campaign contribution limits.

Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.

Article: The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump’s budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn’t, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Backup plan Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

Article: QCOM YTD mountain Qualcomm in 2025 Just last Thursday, the stock slid close to 8% after the company posted fiscal third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, posting adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share on revenue of $10.37 billion. Nevertheless, investors – and several analysts – appeared to turn their attention toward Qualcomm's shifting business mix, as the company provides modems to Apple and it expects to lose the iPhone maker as a client for that business in the approaching years. "We understand why the company gets no respect at the moment, but believe there is time to at least do some work on the name," wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a July 31 report. Data centers represent "a new growth opportunity for Qualcomm and [are] a logical extension of our diversification strategy as we continue to demonstrate leadership in CPU performance and NPU efficiency," said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm CEO in a July 30 analyst call. Amon noted on the earnings call that Qualcomm is "engaged with multiple potential customers and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler" as the company expands its data center strategy. "Qualcomm is still in early stages and revenues might ramp only in 2028, but management noted advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler," Bank of America analyst Tal Liani said in a July 31 report. Investors who bought Qualcomm 20 years ago and reinvested their dividends into the stock would have seen a total return of more than 480%, compared to the price return of over 270%, according to FactSet. While investors can decide to set up a dividend reinvesting program to build out their position in a stock like Qualcomm – which would assure that they buy shares at regular intervals regardless of the price – they will want to be selective about committing to a particular name. In that case, a dividend-paying ETF, like the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) or ProShares S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) offers diversification across a basket of stocks and sectors.

Alan Robert Williams, 35, from Moreton in Wirral went to the country after losing his job despite having no military experience and his family's pleas not to go, Stephanie Boyce-Williams said. She said fellow fighters contacted her to say he had been killed in a Russian drone attack in the Kharkiv region by adding "it doesn't feel real" and she was "in limbo" waiting for official confirmation of his death. The family said they lost contact with him on 2 July after he set off on a mission, and were later told on 14 July he was listed as missing action, and two weeks later a member of his unit confirmed he had died. Ms Boyce-Williams told BBC Radio Merseyside: "I was sitting at home with my oldest son when I got the text through to say they had important information and could they call me so I knew instantly." She said she and others in the family had tried to convince her husband not to go to fight but he was determined.

Article: On Martha's Vineyard, Black filmmakers are in the spotlight toggle caption Arturo Holmes/Getty Images When I finally had a chance to sit down with pioneering rapper Slick Rick, one question nagged in the back of my brain: Where was the eye patch? Slick Rick, whose given name is Ricky Walters, was blinded in his right eye as a child and developed a habit of wearing stylish eye patches since his early days in the mid-1980s performing with Doug E. But when we met Saturday at the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, he was chilling behind a pair of mirrored shades — looking less like a hip hop pirate than a moneyed man of leisure summering in the playground of the Black bourgeoisie. Sponsor Message "This, to me, feels like an upscale Black environment," he told me backstage, after I had quizzed him before festival attendees about his visual project Victory, the film version of his first album in 26 years. Maybe there was a little piece that's missing in their soul that this [film] fills up and gives a little inspiration … [But] I don't want to get too crazy out here, you know?" Slick Rick needn't have worried. While the crowd on a Saturday afternoon was a little older and more straitlaced than the club kids who originally made his songs like "Children's Story" and "La Di Da Di" signature hits, they embraced the ambitious visuals and kinetic sounds on Victory, which strung together imaginative videos from the album's songs into one long, trippy film. Assembled with movie star Idris Elba — who is also a DJ and released the album on his label, 7Wallace — Victory is packed with bustling images crafted by Nigerian director Meji Alabi, who worked on Beyoncé's Black is King video project. And the film's expansive visuals dazzle — evoking his grandfather's London living room for the song "Foreign" and dipping into a raucous, makeshift underground club for the song "Cuz I'm Here" — built around house music jams Rick heard Elba spinning during a DJ set. This was a grand return to form for an old rap master; I left the screening and panel discussion hoping it got wider attention so more people could see what Slick Rick and his team had cooked up. This is the vibe at the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, or MVAAFF, now in its 23rd year, providing space for Black artists to roll out ambitious projects in the most welcoming space possible. The Vineyard holds a special place in the hearts of some Black folks — a historic sanctuary and getaway for those who can afford it — and the MVAAFF spotlights work by artists presenting a wide variety of images. Watching screenings and talking with filmmakers over the first few days felt like sifting through an intriguing array of ambitious projects centered on Black life that few other festivals might recognize or encourage. But the audience here has mostly come to admire and support Black artists at a time when making space for historically marginalized voices is derided as reverse racism, DEI shenanigans or worse. Over several days, I saw lots of compelling work: In the dramatic short Lost/Found, Eric Roberts plays an older white man, burdened on his deathbed by guilt in the aftermath of an accident that cost the life of a young Black father. (Howery said he was shooting for a comedic version of Morgan Freeman's character Joe Clark from the film Lean on Me.) Written by co-star Barshea Lowery, the movie features five alumni accidentally locked in their old cafeteria during a 10-year reunion, in a Black-centered version of The Breakfast Club. Lowery, a native of my hometown of Gary, Ind., told me he crafted the film as an answer to all the John Hughes films set in nearby Chicago that featured zero Black people. And while watching his film packed with jokes centered on characters I knew, set in a town where I had also grown up, I felt the kind of connection that was immediate and satisfying — even beyond what I felt watching The Breakfast Club in the theater back in 1985. The biggest outpouring of joy I saw at the festival this year, however, was when TV producer Mara Brock Akil screened the last episode from the first season of her Netflix series Forever for a standing room only crowd. Akil, creator of classic Black-centered sitcoms like Girlfriends and The Game, has been a resident of the Vineyard for years, tipped to the area back in the mid-1990s when she was on the writing staff of Moesha. And its fifth episode, "The Vineyard," is set on the island, emerging as something of a love letter, showing the rhythms of a successful Black family who had been vacationing there for years. toggle caption Elizabeth Morris/Netflix "I felt like I was bringing the baby home and everybody thinks she is cute," said Akil after finishing a Q&A after the screening, where she told a rapturous audience she saw this story as her version of the classic romantic film, The Blue Lagoon. "You know, [when they started filming the episode] there was this moment when the crew comes in, and I wondered, 'Oh boy, did I mess up by bringing work to my place of rest?' But then I remembered … just make sure you reflect the story, not just of Black culture, but the culture of Martha's Vineyard." In describing her connection to the island, Akil uses a word Black folks sometimes don't deploy when talking about living conditions: Relaxed. But she acknowledges that the push against diversity and inclusion in corporate America and Hollywood has made the industry more hostile to Black creative people just starting out; she's hopeful her appearance at the festival offers some encouragement to the aspiring filmmakers in the crowd. Sponsor Message "[Corporations] are pulling back on spending and some people are going to automatically drop out of the business — and once they get pushed out, it's hard to get back in," Akil said. So I think we have to pivot to building a new community … that's what I'm looking for." Based on what I saw, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is one powerful place to build and grow that spirit.

Article: The judge's decision on Thursday comes after Wednesday's hearing only saw five witnesses called to the stand by the environmental groups that filed the lawsuit, instead of the multiple state and federal officials who were set to testify. Attorneys representing Florida officials have argued that the facility was initially funded by, constructed and managed by the state and is therefore exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act -- the main law being used to challenge the facility's compliance. Alligator Alcatraz has so far operated in what immigration advocates have described as a jurisdictional gray zone -- with the facility funded by the federal government but run by the state of Florida -- that they allege allows officials to skirt some legal requirements. Ron DeSantis has previously argued that the state of Florida is "implementing" the federal government's immigration policy with the expectation that the state would be fully reimbursed for the costs of Alligator Alcatraz, but local and federal officials have so far been unable to tell the federal courts who is actually in charge of the facility. The hearing -- at which federal, state, and tribal officials are testifying -- comes amid heightened scrutiny of the facility, which was once touted as a "one-stop shop to carry out President Trump's mass deportation agenda." Located 50 miles west of Miami in the heart of the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz was quickly constructed over a matter of weeks, utilizing hundreds of tents, trailers, and other temporary facilities to potentially house more than 3,000 detainees.

Article: Mary Kay burns incense at the entrance to the state-managed immigration detention center dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades on August 03, 2025 in Ochopee, Florida. A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Article: Air Force has decided to deny early retirement options for transgender service members with 15 to 18 years of service US Air Force to deny retirement pay to transgender service members being separated from the service FILE - The logo of the Department of the U.S. Air Force said Thursday it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. An Air Force spokesperson told The Associated Press that “although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.” About a dozen service members had been “prematurely notified” that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Air Force policy.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File) WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program that was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. The funding, part of Democratic President Joe Biden’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.” “Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.

Article: READ MORE: Trump says he plans to put 100% tariff on computer chips, likely increasing electronics costs “We are still waiting for official guidance,” said Limor Fried, founder and engineer at Adafruit Industries, a small electronics maker in New York. “For many of these tariffs, we often have to wait until we get a bill to know our exposure, and then we adjust our pricing to account for the increases.” The U.S. economic pain is surfacing “The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. READ MORE: Trump says Intel’s CEO must resign, sending its stock tumbling But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the artificial intelligence boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, which supplies chips to the auto industry, said in an emailed statement Thursday that it “can’t speculate about potential semiconductor tariffs” and Trump’s announcement, “as no official documents have been published at this point.” These producers “probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. It’s also not clear how the chip-specific tariffs would apply to trading partners that already made broader deals with Trump — such as agreements with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that tax most goods at 15%. READ MORE: Trump to put additional 25% import taxes on India, bringing combined tariffs to 50% During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry. Trump’s announcement could be a signal for other chipmakers to imitate the investments that companies like South Korea’s Samsung are making, said Long Le, a business professor at Santa Clara University. But with China’s SMIC and Huawei unlikely to be exempted, it could also give the Trump administration “more leverage at the trading table” ahead of an upcoming deal with China, he said.

Pasta cacio e pepe is a beloved Roman dish, renowned for being simple yet surprisingly challenging to make - so Good Food's description of it as something that can be quickly whipped up for "a speedy lunch" irritated many. Mr Pica said: "This iconic dish, traditionally from Rome and the Lazio region, has been a staple of Italian cuisine for years, so much so it has been replicated even beyond Italy's borders." He regretted contradicting the British site, but clarified that "the original recipe for cacio e pepe excludes parmesan and butter. The furore has been widely covered in Italian media, with a journalist at public broadcaster RAI saying: "We are always told, you are not as good as the BBC… and then they go and do this. The suggestion of adding some cream gave me goosebumps." The Good Food food brand was owned by BBC Studios (the BBC's commercial wing) until 2018, when it was sold to Immediate Media Co - with the BBC prefix being dropped from its name last year. "It's terrible!" says pasta restaurant owner Giorgio Erami While some chefs may experiment with the dish, the main concern is that the website misled readers by presenting its version as the original. Then it becomes something else." He added: "You have to yield to Caesar that which is Caesar's!" Giorgio Eramo runs a fresh pasta restaurant near St Peter's square - serving up cacio e pepe and other traditional pasta dishes.

Three men who sent Trump their medals after the 2024 shooting in Butler are expected to attend the event in the East Room to mark National Purple Heart Day, according to a White House official. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are also expected to be there, along with Chris LaCivita, Trump’s former campaign co-manager and a Marine veteran who is also a Purple Heart recipient. After a shooter’s bullet pierced the upper part of Trump’s right ear in Butler just days before the 2024 Republican National Convention, the then-Republican presidential candidate was gifted medals from some Purple Heart recipients.

Article: In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WASHINGTON, DC August 6: US President Donald Trump shakes hands with CEO of Apple Tim Cook during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday August 6, 2025. "The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back." Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt. "CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time," said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple. "What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters," said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S. For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning , in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an "investment" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning "already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets," adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year. Other partnerships are with Applied Materials , a tooling company, GlobalFoundries , a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is suppling Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips. While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that "the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook." Trump had a different take. In Apple's fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach.

"They were sifting through all of it and they found a piece of my mom's ATM card that was in her luggage and then it must have been seventeen years later they found part of her hair brush," he said. "The pain of losing a loved one in the September 11th terror attacks echoes across the decades, but with these three new identifications, we take a step forward in comforting the family members still aching from that day," said NYC Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer who was on duty on 9/11.

Article: MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. READ MORE: Alligator Alcatraz’ detainees held without charges, barred from legal access, attorneys say Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe have asked Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. Following Thursday’s testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. READ MORE: DeSantis says deportation flights from Florida’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention center have begun Williams asked Florida attorney Jesse Panuccio if the state would agree to halt construction so that she wouldn’t need to issue the restraining order. The crux of the plaintiffs’ argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn’t apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center’s construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: Netanyahu divides Israelis and allies with plan to occupy Gaza Many in Israel believe Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee the survival of his coalition He did not give details about possible arrangements or which countries could be involved; still, this was a rare indication of what he might be envisioning for a post-war Gaza. As the security cabinet prepared to meet to discuss the proposals, Netanyahu gave an interview to Fox News in which he said Israel intended to take full control of Gaza, in order to assure its security, remove Hamas from power and enable the transfer of the governance of the civilian population to another party, without giving details. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans for a new military push in the Gaza Strip have raised warnings from the army leadership, opposition from hostage families and concerns that more Palestinians will be killed, and risk isolating the country even further. A Palestinian woman looks at destroyed tents for displaced people in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, following an Israeli strike For now, however, Netanyahu wants an expanded offensive that is likely to see the Israeli military, which says it controls about 75% of the territory, operating in Gaza City and the camps in the central part of the strip, where around one million Palestinians live and the hostages are thought to be held. This could spark fresh condemnation from countries that have expressed anger over the situation in Gaza and urged Israel to end the nearly two-year war, which started as a response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. In a sign of major divergencies between the political and military leadership, the Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, told Netanyahu that the full occupation of Gaza was "tantamount to walking into a trap", according to reports in Israeli media. According to the Maariv newspaper, the "prevailing assessment is that most and possibly all of the living hostages [will] die" during an expanded offensive, either killed by their captors or accidentally by Israeli soldiers. The British ambassador to Israel, Simon Walter, said the full occupation of Gaza would be a "huge mistake", while also pushing back against US and Israeli allegations that a possible recognition of Palestinian statehood by the UK was a reward for Hamas. Netanyahu has, so far, failed to offer a vision for Gaza after the war apart from refusing to accept a governing role for the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied West Bank and recognises Israel. But many here believe that Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee the survival of his coalition, which relies on the support of ultranationalist ministers who have threatened to quit the government if there is any deal with Hamas. Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have also publicly defended expelling Palestinians from Gaza - which could amount to the forced displacement of civilians, a war crime - and resettling it with Jews.

Article: Trump orders colleges to share admissions data, with an eye on affirmative action toggle caption LA Johnson/NPR President Trump signed a presidential memorandum Thursday requiring colleges and universities to submit expanded admissions data to the U.S. The move is the latest salvo in the administration's fight against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and is intended to reveal if schools are still preferencing race in admissions even after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in 2023. Thursday's memo claims "the lack of available admissions data from universities – paired with the rampant use of "diversity statements" and other overt and hidden racial proxies – continues to raise concerns about whether race is actually used in admissions decisions in practice." Sponsor Message Any college or university that participates in the federal student loan program is already required to submit certain data to the department about enrollment, graduation rates and financial aid. "Institutions of higher education will now have to report data disaggregated by race and sex," according to a department release, and "will include quantitative measures of applicants' and admitted students' academic achievements such as standardized test scores, GPAs and other applicant characteristics." "We will not allow institutions to blight the dreams of students by presuming that their skin color matters more than their hard work and accomplishments," McMahon said in a statement.

Chief Justice John Roberts made clear that applicants can still discuss race in their admissions essays though, writing that "nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant's discussion of how race affected his or her life." Recent settlement agreements with both Columbia University and Brown University require both schools to report the race, color, test scores and grades of all applicants. It also bans "personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discrimination." After the Brown agreement, which closely resembles Columbia's, McMahon said in a statement, "The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions" and that "aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex." Of the roughly 4,000 colleges and universities in the U.S., a relatively small fraction – around 200 schools – are considered highly-selective. Some, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Amherst College, saw considerable drops in their share of Black students, while others, including Yale University and Princeton University, saw little change. It's not clear how ably the Education Department can collect, manage and analyze what will be a flood of new data – or crack down on schools the department believes run afoul of its merit-based admissions criteria. "This isn't flipping a switch or typing something up and saying, 'Just do it,'" says Jason Cottrell, the former data coordinator for the Education Department's Office of Postsecondary Education and a member of AFGE Local 252, a union of department employees.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI is forcing out more senior officials, including a former acting director who resisted Trump administration demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in Jan. The basis for the ouster of Brian Driscoll, who led the bureau in the turbulent weeks after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, were not immediately clear, but Driscoll’s final day at the FBI is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. READ MORE: Former agent who accused FBI of political bias is charged with disclosing confidential records “I understand that you may have a lot of questions regarding why, for which I have no answers,” Driscoll wrote in a message to colleagues. “No cause has been articulated at this time.” Another high-profile termination is Steven Jensen, who for months had been the assistant director in charge of the Washington field office, one of the bureau’s largest and busiest. Jensen did not say whether he had been given a reason, but his appointment to the job in April was sharply criticized by some Trump supporters because he had overseen a domestic terrorism section after the 2021 riot at the Capitol. The FBI has characterized that attack, in which the Republican president’s supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to halt the certification of election results after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, as an act of domestic terrorism. The FBI Agents Association said in a statement that it was concerned by reports of the firings of senior leaders and that it was reviewing all legal options to defend its members. A broader personnel purge The news about Driscoll and Jensen comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino. Many within the FBI had seen that request as a precursor for mass firings, particularly in light of separate moves to fire members of special counsel Jack Smith’s team that prosecuted Trump, reassign senior career Justice Department officials and force out prosecutors on Jan. The Justice Department’s request Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo at the time accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination” for resisting his requests “to identify the core team” responsible for Jan. He said the requests were meant to “permit the Justice Department to conduct a review of those particular agents’ conduct pursuant to Trump’s executive order” on “weaponization” in the Biden administration. In his farewell note, Driscoll told colleagues that it was “the honor of my life to serve alongside each of you.” He wrote: “Our collective sacrifice for those we serve is, and will always be, worth it. You are my heroes and I remain in your debt.” Agents demoted, reassigned and pushed out The FBI has moved under Patel’s watch to aggressively demote, reassign or push out agents seen as being out of favor with bureau leadership or the Trump administration. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

Article: Air Force said Thursday it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. WATCH: Transgender military members fight to continue serving despite Trump’s ban An Air Force spokesperson told The Associated Press that “although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.” About a dozen service members had been “prematurely notified” that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Air Force policy. A memo issued Monday announcing the new policy, which was reviewed by the AP, said that the choice to deny retirement benefits was made “after careful consideration of the individual applications.” All transgender members of the Air Force are being separated from the service under the Trump administration’s policies. Separation process has hit some bumps The move comes after the Pentagon was given permission in early May by the Supreme Court to move forward with a ban on all transgender troops serving in the military. Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a policy that would offer currently openly serving transgender troops the option to either volunteer to leave and take a large, one-time separation payout or be involuntarily separated at later date. A Pentagon official told reporters in May that they viewed the policy as treating “anyone impacted by it with dignity and respect.” However, in late July, transgender troops told Military.com that they were finding the entire separation process, which has included reverting their service records back to their birth gender, “dehumanizing” or “open cruelty.” Shannon Leary, a lawyer who represents LGBTQ+ people in employment discrimination cases, says she expects lawsuits to challenge Thursday’s decision. “These military members have dedicated their lives to serving our country.” Normally, Leary said, when early retirement is offered in the military, it’s available to all members who have served over 15 years. Under the latest policy, active duty troops had until June 6 to voluntarily identify themselves and receive a payout while troops in the National Guard and Reserve had until July 7.

The move would provide the government with information that has long been on the wish list of conservative activists in search of evidence that schools have been dodging a 2023 Supreme Court decision that largely barred the consideration of race in college admissions. Admissions data has increasingly become a focus of the Trump administration as part of its effort to shift the ideological balance of academia, which the president views as hostile to conservatives.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. WATCH: As economists warn tariff policies are hammering the dollar, Trump family invests heavily in crypto The Republican president’s order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Trump’s move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers, offering Americans more diversification and investment options with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, the president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group for the private equity industry. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

Article: Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment. READ MORE: Trump demands that Federal Reserve board wrest full control of central bank from Fed Chair Powell The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Trump has said he will appoint a Fed chair who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government’s huge $36 trillion debt pile. Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump’s sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Leading candidates for that position include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and frequent critic of Powell’s chairmanship, and Kevin Hassett, another top Trump economic adviser. After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again.

In a lawsuit, Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice and the Miccosukee Tribe say the rushed construction of the facility — dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz' by state officials — without public input or an environmental impact statement violates federal law. Sponsor Message The facility, which has tents and caged cells for up to 5,000 immigration detainees, is housed at a mostly abandoned airfield located within the wetlands of the Big Cypress National Preserve. toggle caption Alon Skuy/Getty Images After two days of hearings, she became frustrated when she learned construction was still continuing at the site and lawyers for Florida refused a request to put it on hold. Randy Kautz, a wildlife ecologist who helped write the state's Panther Recovery plan, said because of the bright lights, increased traffic and human presence at the site, Florida panthers would be pushed out of at least 2,000 acres of their habitat. Sponsor Message Wetlands Ecologist Christopher McVoy, who helped write the plan to restore the Everglades, raised concerns with the court about 20 acres of new asphalt paving on the site and the impact it would have on water quality in the fragile ecosystem. toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images The groups say rushing the construction without holding hearings, taking public comment or conducting an Environmental Impact Study, Florida and the Trump administration violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA.) Justice Department attorney Marissa Piropato told the judge, "NEPA does not apply here because the federal detention facility is controlled by Florida." Florida is spending an estimated $450 million to cover the cost of construction and operations of the site but is expected to seek reimbursement from the Trump administration. During the hearings, Judge Williams cited comments by Trump administration officials who have called it an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility and repeatedly asked, "Who's running the show?" She suggested the shifting responsibilities for construction and operation of the detention center may have been a deliberate effort by federal officials to avoid having to comply with NEPA. Following the judge's order, Eve Samples with Friends of the Everglades said, "We're pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility." A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General, James Uthmeier said, "Judge Williams' order is wrong, and we will fight it." Temporary restraining orders are typically not subject to appeal.

Article: A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved me from sepsis - and could transform the NHS 23 minutes ago Share Save Jim Reed • jim_reed Health reporter Share Save BBC Tom Parker, 37, broke his leg in a fishing accident three miles off the Devon coast Tom Parker was working alone three miles (4.8km) off the Devon coast when his fishing boat hit a wave and lurched to one side. So much so, I couldn't get up off the floor." He didn't know it at the time, but Tom, 37, had broken his fibula and badly damaged his ankle ligaments. It was only after he turned up at an innovative clinic on the quayside in Brixham that he was put on strong antibiotics and told he needed a second operation. Under a 10-year plan, published last month, health officials said the NHS in England needed to undergo a radical shift, away from hospitals to community care, and away from treating sickness to preventing it in the first place. The fishermen's health clinic in Brixham is one of 79 Seafit clinics set up in fishing ports across the UK since 2019 On a clear summer morning a spare room in the trawler agent's offices in Brixham harbour is quickly being converted into a temporary health clinic. "The skippers of the boats and the whole fishing community now know exactly where to find us," says Dr James Gunning, the local NHS GP in charge of the clinic that day. "They're a community that fits into health inequalities, where a population either can't access, or struggles to access, normal NHS services." Clinic staff start early in the morning, walking around the docks and coaxing workers off the boats with promises of free health screenings and physio. "Fishermen don't have nine-to-five jobs, they don't have lunchtime where they can just pop off their fishing boat and to the GP's office, and so it's really important that we take those services to them," says Sandra Welch, chief executive of the Seafarers Hospital Society, which runs the initiative along with another charity, the Fishermen's Mission. Dr James Gunning, a local GP in Brixham, runs the fishermen's health clinic at the port along with a team of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists In its 10-year plan the NHS accepts that those who live in coastal and rural areas are more likely to experience worse health outcomes and to die younger. Seaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs, while at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving staffing gaps where they are needed most. An analysis of hospital statistics by the BBC suggests NHS trusts in England treating coastal communities tend to have higher than average wait times for both emergency care and appointments booked in advance, like surgery. The sites, which should eventually be open 12 hours a day, six days a week, will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, social care workers, pharmacists, mental health specialists and other medics. The big idea, as with the Brixham fishermen's clinic, is to better tailor health services to local communities, and offer people more checks and tests to stop them falling sick in the first place. You need the upfront investment and the results might not be visible for five or 10 years, in some cases longer." Healthcare unions have also questioned how the new centres will be staffed, saying doctors "must not be moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder".

Laurent Saint-Cyr's appointment at the council's heavily guarded office in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where criminal gangs control 90% of the neighborhoods, marked the first time that members of Haiti's private sector serve in both the rotating presidency and the post of prime minister, two positions that share the country's executive duties. It's time to act." Gang leader issues a warning Hours earlier, a powerful gang federation that has long denounced Haiti's oligarchs threatened to overthrow the government, and gunfire erupted in parts of the capital. In a video posted on social media, Viv Ansanm gang leader Jimmy Chérizier — better known as "Barbecue" — warns residents to give his armed group free passage through neighborhoods to reach the council's office. "People of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us … in the battle to free the country," Chérizier says, wearing a bulletproof vest and with an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police said in a statement that officers thwarted potential attacks by around-the-clock patrols and by boosting the number of armed forces in certain neighborhoods and around critical infrastructure. He'll be working with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a one-time president of an internet company in Haiti and also a former president of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "The challenges we face are certainly linked to insecurity, but they also are the result of our lack of courage, a lack of vision and our irresponsibility." He questioned what was preventing the government from offering services Haitians deserve, including health and education. "The elites have always wanted power, and they have always wanted to control Haiti, and now they're in control," said Marline Jean-Pierre, a 44-year-old teacher who braved gunfire to visit a friend at a hospital in downtown Port-au-Prince. "Young women are being raped, families are being dismantled." However, dozens of Haitians wearing white T-shirts and clutching signs emblazoned with Saint-Cyr's photograph gathered outside the council's office to support him. A plea for more officers In a report released Thursday, the U.N.-backed mission noted that it has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year. The mission also noted that the government remains fragile: "Partisan infighting within the transitional government has had the effect of paralyzing the government and emboldening the gangs." Sponsor Message Gangs in Kenscoff recently kidnapped eight people from an orphanage, including an Irish missionary and a 3-year-old child. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) President Donald Trump stepped up pressure on large banks and their regulators on Thursday, signing an executive order requiring the banking industry to ensure it is not refusing financial services to anyone based on political or religious beliefs, a practice frequently described as "debanking." The order directed regulators to review all banks they supervise for any current or past practices that would effectively bar customers based on political or religious beliefs, and levy fines or other disciplinary measures as needed. It said regulators may refer certain cases to the Justice Department for potential civil action and also directed regulators themselves to purge any policies or practices that may discourage banks from providing services based on non-financial reasons. Trump claimed in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that he personally was discriminated against by banks, asserting without evidence that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office.

Article: President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum that requires universities to collect admissions data to prove they are not engaged in efforts to shape their student bodies along racial lines, according to the White House. Supreme Court ruling knocked down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, but universities have skirted that decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race. Department of Education said in a statement that Education Secretary Linda McMahon had directed the National Center for Education Statistics to collect from universities data on the race and gender of their applicant pool, on the students admitted and of all enrolled undergraduates. Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 member schools, said collecting such data was illegal under the very Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action. "This seems to be an effort to get institutions to provide information that we don't have and that we can't collect." But a senior Trump administration official said the administration's understanding of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action was that nothing in it "prohibits the collection of demographic data as long as such data is not used in admissions decisions." The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter, spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study. “It’s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,” said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was “really smart and significant.” Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. “They’re voracious eaters.” With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population – and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations — and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to “the rainforests of the ocean.” The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Article: PE firms typically sell their portfolio companies through various exit routes such as trade sales to strategic buyers, secondary sales to other PE firms, and public listings via initial public offerings, which then allows the firm to return capital and profits to limited partners (LPs), who are private equity fund investors. Johns Hopkins Carey Business School Jeff Hooke However, PE firms are buying and investing in more companies than they can offload them — which means investors are trapped in aging funds or waiting longer for their returns. The ratio of PE investments to exits has jumped from 2.6x in 2024 to 3.14x in 2025, the highest in a decade, as firms continue to delay sales, recent data from PitchBook showed . Zombie funds The slowdown has a side effect: the rise of "zombie funds" — private equity vehicles that exist but have little hope of fully exiting their investments or raising new capital. It's just sort of sitting there." A growing number of private equity investors are seeing their capital locked in so-called "zombie funds," a 2024 survey by the secondaries asset manager showed . "This is the second time in the last five years or so that the exit environment has been in this wait-and-see mode," said Kyle Walters, a PE analyst at PitchBook. "LPs were much more understanding the first time around … but this time, you see fewer patient LPs," he told CNBC, adding that LPs are opting to sell off portions of PE portfolios to secondary funds as they opt for cash rather than wait further. According to PitchBook, 54.7% of all active PE funds globally are now six years or older, higher than the 52.2% at the end of 2024 — a sign that fund timelines are stretching well past the norm. What's behind the exit freeze The exit slowdown began as early as 2022 but accelerated after April 2 when the Trump administration announced sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs that jolted financial markets, market watchers said. Harold Hope, global head of secondary investing at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, said the core issue is a "valuation gap" between what PE managers think their companies are worth and what potential buyers are willing to pay. Buyers and sellers are not seeing eye to eye," he said, explaining that the trend began after 2021, when buyers became more conservative as interest rates rose, among other factors. "With a lack of strategic buyers, the dead IPO market here [especially] in the United States, firms are left with the third alternative, which is selling to themselves via a continuation fund, or selling to other private equity funds," Hooke said. "It may never see the IPO market or strategic buyer for, you know, 15-20 years." Other alternatives: continuation vehicles General partners, who are the people or firms managing the private equity funds, are looking to alternative liquidity strategies. Goldman Sachs' Hope noted that continuation vehicles provide a way to generate liquidity in an environment when the fund manager may not want to — or can't — sell the entire business at a value that they believe is appropriate, he said. "Particularly as GPs regularly extend investment periods." The exit drought has also led some private equity managers — especially smaller or mid-sized firms — to explore alternative strategies, including allocating more toward public markets. "Rolling up and constantly putting equity into larger and larger deals is not something that we find relatively attractive going forward," said Jonathan Hahn, investment analyst at private markets investment firm NorthStar Capital. "It's an unsustainable practice… especially with business owners wanting to eventually pull out the equity and actually have it as cash." Instead, Hahn is leaning into the public market opportunity, adding that the firm has launched a new public equities fund because of the recent ramping up of activity within the space. He also observed that PE's sheen may be starting to wear off, noting that some investors are asking themselves: Why would I go into the private markets when I can get the same or better return in public markets and have better liquidity?

Article: Since early last year, Musk has been trying to convince shareholders that Tesla, his only publicly traded business, is poised to become an an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse, and not just an electric vehicle company. A centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles. Tesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis. On Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be "operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents," referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips. On the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent. Musk said the companies "are doing different things." He said, "xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models." Tesla uses "100x smaller models," he said, with the automaker focused on "real-world AI," for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for "artificial super intelligence." Musk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because "they wanted to work on AGI," one reason he said he formed a new company.

Article: The US has doubled a reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50m (£37.2m), accusing him of being "one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world". "We're not surprised, coming from whom it comes from," Gil said, accusing Bondi of attempting a "desperate distraction" from headlines related to backlash over the handling of the case of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a video posted on X on Thursday, Bondi accused Maduro of coordinating with groups like Tren de Aragua - a Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration has declared a terrorist organisation - and the Sinaloa Cartel, a powerful criminal network based in Mexico. Bondi's comments are an extension of long-running tensions between the US and Venezuelan government - but the attorney general did not provide any further indication over how the government envisioned the renewed appeal and cash incentive would yield results. Maduro - who is leader of the United Socialist Party and succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013 - has been repeatedly accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, including with the use of violence. But in June, Hugo Carvajal - formerly the head of Venezuela's military intelligence - was convicted of several drug trafficking charges after being arrested in Madrid and put on trial in the US. Carvajal had been a feared spymaster who went by the name El Pollo, or The Chicken, but fled Venezuela after calling on the army to back an opposition candidate and overthrow Maduro. He initially denied the drug charges but later changed his plea to guilty, fuelling speculation he had cut a deal with US authorities for a lesser sentence in exchange for incriminating information about Maduro.

Article: Big Mags: The paedophile-hunting granny who built a heroin empire 4 hours ago Share Save Myles Bonnar BBC Scotland News Share Save The rise and fall of the notorious 'Big Mags' Haney In January 1997, long before the modern phenomena of online "paedophile hunters", a Scottish grandmother found overnight fame when she successfully drove a convicted child sex offender out of the Raploch housing estate in Stirling. Haney's public profile rose after an appearance on the popular daytime show Kilroy in 1997 She was embraced as a salt-of-the-earth straight talker, applauded in many quarters for standing up for decent folk and for taking action to, as she would put it, fix a problem no-one else was tackling. "I think it was something at her core that she really believed was wrong," says Cassie Donald, Haney's granddaughter, who has spoken for the first time to a BBC podcast. Haney argued with the show's famous host and squabbled with other guests on the Kilroy show With the family's crimes exposed and the local community's patience at an end, Big Mags and the Haneys were forced to leave the estate by a 400-strong mob - bigger than the one whipped up to remove the paedophile Alan Christie six months earlier. Haney found overnight fame when she successfully drove a convicted child sex offender out of the Raploch estate After her exile from the Raploch estate, Haney was put in temporary council accommodation. But with no other local authority in Scotland or the north of England willing to rehouse her, she eventually settled in Lower Bridge Street, a stone's throw away from her old stomping ground. The phones lit up, with many callers ringing up to put Big Mags in the frame, exposing her as the big boss of a drug dynasty that ran heroin out of their flats. The journalist had a well-placed source who laid out to him the Haney drug operation, with Mags at the top, so he "scratched around" and witnessed family members selling drugs from the flats. "I've walked in, I've been asked to come into the living room and I was kind of surprised that Mags had sat in a throne, a big chair in the middle of the room," the reporter recalls. "I was thinking, 'how am I going to get out of here?'." Haney was the subject of a BBC Scotland Frontline documentary Rumbled and feeling somewhat intimidated, McGivern scarpered out of "Fortress Haney", as it was known, and headed back to write up his story. "The attitudes towards them at the time were very much, 'you've made your bed and you lie in it', and there wasn't a lot of thought for everybody." Haney was 60 when she was convicted in 2003 Despite these convictions, local residents and journalists remained puzzled as to why it took so long to dismantle the Haney drug operation, which was allegedly rampant throughout the 1990s. "Crime families and organised crime leaders, I have met all of these people and I've never met one that didn't talk to the police at some level." Another police source confirmed that Big Mags would provide officers with information.

The parliamentary under-secretary of state for homelessness and rough sleeping was accused of "staggering hypocrisy" after it was alleged that she had "ejected" tenants from one of her properties, before re-listing it for an additional £700 a month.

Article: They didn't affect his legal right to own guns toggle caption Stephanie Keith/Getty Images North America Records released this week by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police confirm they had several contacts in recent years with Shane Tamura, the 27-year-old man who drove to New York and killed four people on July 28. The records show he was known to suffer from mental illness, had been the subject of two emergency psychiatric evaluations , and yet was still allowed to buy firearms legally — including the AR-15-style rifle used in New York. Sponsor Message The incidents, in 2022 and 2024, both resulted in police filing paperwork to commit Tamura to emergency psychiatric care, often referred to as a "mental health hold." Tamura was still allowed to buy firearms because Nevada doesn't automatically upload information about temporary mental health holds to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), according to Jeff Swanson , a Duke University professor who studies the intersection of law and public safety, and has written about the firearms background check system. "Under Nevada law, a law enforcement officer or health care professional can initiate a 72-hour emergency mental health [hold] for a person deemed [a] danger to [him or herself] or others. "These emergency holds by themselves are not reported to NICS and wouldn't show up in a background check." Swanson adds that when it comes to identifying people who pose a risk, the criteria for inclusion in the NICS federal background check system for mental incapacity "tend to be too broad and too narrow at the same time." Sponsor Message Under federal law, a person must be "adjudicated" as a "mental defective" by a court or other authority before being included in the national list of people prohibited from buying guns. And then there are a lot of other people who might have really impulsive anger traits and a really short fuse and they're not prohibited, necessarily, because they don't have one of these records," Swanson says. If a year-long ERPO had been issued for Tamura after his last mental health hold, last August, he would not have been allowed to buy the rifle he used in New York last month — at least, not legally. "If a jurisdiction, a state, a locality isn't actively training law enforcement officers on how to use this, it won't be used." She says officers should be given step-by-step instructions for how to ask a court to intervene when a gun owner appears to have become a danger.

Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart) A shooting that injured five soldiers at one of the country's largest military bases on Wednesday has resurfaced questions about a long-standing army policy that largely prevents service members from carrying personal weapons on military installations. Department of Defense policy prohibits military personnel from carrying personal weapons on base without permission from a senior commander, and there is a strict protocol for how the firearm must be stored. “You simply don't want folks walking around a federal installation with personal weapons.” He said he has traveled to “nearly every single major military installation” in North America for his work. “Outside of a military situation, the service member has just as much Second Amendment right as anyone else.” For example, it could be fairly straightforward for a service member living off-base to bring a weapon onto the military installation, Carpenter said, because a senior commander can't regulate gun ownership off base.

Article: From the Stones to Cardi B, this college haunt has attracted big acts for 50 years FILE - The Rolling Stones perform during an impromptu concert at the Toad's Place nightclub in New Haven, Conn., early Sunday, Aug. But inside the modest, two-story building is a veritable museum of paintings and signed photos depicting the head-turning array of artists who've played the nightclub over the years: The Rolling Stones. “You know, I thought it would be good for a few years and then I’d be out doing something else,” said owner Brian Phelps, 71, who started as the club’s manager in 1976. “And then the thing started to happen when some of the big bands started to come here.” Original owner Mike Spoerndle initially opened Toad’s Place in January 1975 as a French restaurant with two friends he later bought out. “Mike knew how to make a really great room and Brian knew how to really run a great room,” said Koplik, now president of Live Nation for Connecticut and upstate New York. In 1980, Billy Joel stunned Toad’s by picking it — and several other venues — to record songs for his first live album, “Songs in the Attic.” That same year, a little-known band from Ireland would play at Toad’s as an opening act. On a Saturday night in August 1989, Toad’s advertised a performance by a local band, The Sons of Bob, and a celebration of Koplik’s 40th birthday, followed by a dance party. The Stones had been practicing at a former school in Washington, Connecticut, for their upcoming “Steel Wheels” tour — their first in seven years — and had wanted to play a small club as a warmup. In other words, you’re not watching a screen.” A few months later, Bob Dylan's manager reached out looking for a club where he could warm up for an upcoming tour. He played four-plus hours — believed to be his longest performance — beginning with a cover of Joe South’s 1970 song “Walk a Mile in My Shoes” and ending with his own “All Along the Watchtower.” “That was a good one,” Phelps recalled. Phelps — who bought out Spoerndle's stake in Toad's in 1998 — believes the secret to the venue's longevity has been bringing in acts from different genres, along with events such as dance nights and “battle of the bands”. “When you have all these things, all ages, all different styles of music, and you have some dance parties to fill in where you need them, especially during a slow year, it brings enough capital in so that you can stay in business and keep moving forward,” Phelps said. Rook Bazinet, the 22-year-old singer of the Hartford-based emo group Nor Fork, said the band members' parents told them of all the big acts they'd seen at the New Haven hot spot over the years.

Article: Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio opens a liquid nitrogen freezer used to store blood samples used for research at the university's T.H. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration. You're being cut off.'” The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus," the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. "It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day." John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk.

Article: President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies President Donald Trump speaks while making an announcement about Apple with Apple CEO Tim Cook in the Oval Office, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies. He also ordered bank regulators to probe when banks may have allegedly discriminated and refer the cases to the Department of Justice within 120 days of the signing of the order. When Trump and his party discuss debanking, they typically refer to banks closing the accounts of a person or company when they no longer want to do business with them. The banking industry has long argued that it has a constitutional right to choose whom they go into business with, if it does not violate laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Th act, which was part of several pieces of legislation signed during the Civil Rights Movement, bans banks from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex and other protected statuses. Banks, who have benefited from Trumps deregulation agenda, have tried to strike a cordial tone with the administration, showing themselves as willing brokers who got caught up in a difficult political environment. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way as the (executive order) makes clear,” the major bank lobby groups said Thursday in a joint statement. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview on CNBC, earlier this week alleged that two major banks — JPMorgan and Bank of America — cut him off after he left office in 2021. While the Biden administration did not explicitly force banks to debank the crypto industry, Democratic President Joe Biden’s bank regulators did express some public concern about it, a move that was read by banks as a reason to steer away from crypto. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would require bank regulators to no longer consider reputational risk as a factor in how they measure a bank’s health and risk profile.

Another cluster of storms was dumping rain on the region Thursday, a day after a 24-year-old woman and 55-year-old man were found dead when flooding on a section of highway receded, according to police in the town of Spring Hope. Some communities had been under flash flood warnings and advisories Wednesday while as much as 5 inches (127 millimeters) of rain fell in parts of the Raleigh and Durham areas. The woman and man, both from the small town of Louisburg, had been trapped in a vehicle that was pushed into a ditch filled with about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of fast-moving floodwater, police said.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) A Purdue University student from South Korea has been freed from federal detention, tearfully reuniting with her family and religious community in Manhattan following days of outcry from faith leaders in New York and abroad. Mary Rothwell Davis, an attorney for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where Go’s mother works as a priest, said the family had not received an explanation for the arrest or abrupt reversal. “We were moving heaven and earth to make it known that we thought this was a mistake.” A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Go had been placed in expedited removal proceedings for overstaying an expired visa. “The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported," agency spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. A graduate of Scarsdale High School in the suburbs of New York City, Go studies at Purdue's College of Pharmacy and remains active in the Episcopalian church, according to Davis. In recent days, clergy members, including Bishop Matthew Heyd, as well as the church leaders in Korea, have called on the Trump administration to release Go, insisting that her arrest was a mistake. “Whether it was our outcry or some other factor that persuaded DHS to send her home, we don’t know, but we’re so grateful,” Davis said, adding that Go’s experience in detention was “unbelievably traumatic.” New York State Assemblymember Amy Paulin, a Democrat, said she had spoken by phone with Go, who she described as “relieved” to be home.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File) ROME -- The world experienced it's third-warmest July on record this year, the European Union agency that tracks global warming said Thursday, after two consecutive years when temperatures soared past previous records. “We continued to witness the effects of a warming world.” The EU monitoring agency said new temperature records and more climate extremes are to be expected unless greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are brought down. While not as hot as July 2023 or July 2024, the hottest and second-warmest on record, the Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that the planet's average surface temperature last month was still 1.25 C (2.25 F) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, before humans began the widespread burning of oil, gas and coal. Despite a somewhat cooler July, the 12-month period between August 2024 and July 2025 was 1.53 C above pre-industrial levels, exceeding the threshold set in 2015 to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 C (2.7 F).

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean investigators on Thursday requested a warrant to arrest the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol, a day after questioning her over suspicions including bribery, stock manipulation and political influence-peddling. The investigation targeting Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under the government of new liberal President Lee Jae Myung related to Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The investigation team questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday on various allegations, including claims that Yoon and Kim exerted undue influence over the conservative party’s candidate nominations for a parliamentary by-election in 2022. Kim is also suspected of receiving a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and of possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. In her brief comments to reporters as she appeared for questioning on Wednesday, Kim issued a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinted that she would deny the accusations against her, calling herself “someone insignificant.” Yoon, who faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, previously resisted an attempt by investigators on Friday last week to bring him to their office for questioning over his wife. After winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident the liberals claim Yoon’s government tried to cover up.

(Dean Lewins/AAP Image via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian state government’s decision to pay 2 million Australian dollars ($1.3 million) compensation to a woman who spent 20 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing her four children was condemned by her lawyer Thursday as “profoundly unjust.” New South Wales Attorney-General Michael Daley said Thursday that Kathleen Folbigg’s lawyers had been told the sum the 58-year-old would be paid more than two years after she was released from prison. Folbigg’s lawyer, Rhanee Rego, described the sum as a “profoundly unjust figure” and “hugely insulting.” “Her (Folbigg's) reaction is really that it feels, well — we all feel that it’s profoundly unjust,” Rego told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “When you look at the other comparison cases and take into account what she has endured: she lost her four children; she has spent two decades in jail; vilified as Australia’s worst female serial killer,” Rego added. Rego didn’t put a figure on appropriate compensation, but said it should be “substantially higher.” “I was very much hopeful that it would be substantially more because this is one of our worst wrongful conviction cases in Australia,” Rego said. The inquiry that recommended Folbigg’s pardon and acquittal was prompted by a petition signed in 2021 by 90 scientists, medical practitioners and related professionals who argued that significant new evidence showed the children likely died of natural causes. Folbigg’s friend since childhood, Tracy Chapman, described the compensation sum as “disgraceful.” She said Folbigg was unemployed and living alone with her dog Snowy in rental accommodation in the city of Newcastle. “She’s got to deal with the trauma of the loss of the four kids that was never done properly during 20 years wrongfully convicted in prison, the legal process and all the trauma that was attached to it as well as then living day to day in a world that has changed so much,” Chapman added. Chapman said Folbigg had told her she was “deeply sad and there is no empathy here.” “When I spoke to her she just said: 'Trace, the sad thing here is I’m not surprised,’” Chapman said, using an abbreviated form of Tracy.

The jets, which have short take-off and vertical landing functions, are to operate from two Japanese helicopter carriers, the Izumo and the Kaga, that were modified to accommodate the F-35B. Separately on Thursday, a F-2A single-seater fighter jet crashed in the Pacific off Japan's eastern coast during a training flight, but the pilot was rescued alive after he ejected himself in an emergency, according to the ASDF. Japan plans to deploy a total of 42 Lockheed Martin F-35Bs and 105 of the conventional take-off and landing, or CTOL, F-35As, making the country the biggest F-35 user outside of the United States.

Article: Ryan Donald, public affairs director of the United Nations Command (UNC), Combined Forces Command (CFC), and United States Forces Korea (USFK) attend a press briefing of Ulchi Freedom Shield 2025 exercise at the Defense Ministry in Seoul Thursday, Aug. (Chung Sung-Jun/Pool Photo via AP) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States will launch their annual large-scale military exercise this month to bolster readiness against North Korean threats, the allies said Thursday, in a move likely to irritate Pyongyang amid a prolonged stalemate in diplomacy. Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, following another set of drills in March, typically involves thousands of troops in computer-simulated command post training and combined field exercises. 18-28 exercise may trigger an angry reaction from North Korea, which calls the joint drills invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program. Ryan Donald downplayed speculation that South Korea’s new liberal government, led by President Lee Jae Myung, sought to downsize the exercise to create momentum for dialogue with Pyongyang, saying its scale is similar to previous years. The threat from North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile programs will be a key focus of the exercise, which will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks, Lee said. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks, Lee and Donald said. “We are focused on ensuring the alliance is sustainable and credibly deters aggression from the DPRK and addresses the broader regional security challenges,” he said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The announcement of the exercise came a week after the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rebuffed overtures by Lee Jae Myung’s government, saying that Seoul’s “blind trust” in its alliance with Washington and hostility toward Pyongyang make it no different from its hard-line conservative predecessor. Kim Yo Jong later issued a separate statement dismissing the Trump administration’s intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea’s denuclearization, suggesting that Pyongyang — now focused on expanding ties with Russia — sees little urgency in resuming talks with Seoul or Washington. On the other side of Seoul’s security concerns is whether its alliance with Washington will see dramatic shifts during the second term of President Donald Trump, who has rattled allies and partners with tariff hikes and demands that they reduce their reliance on the U.S. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and roles of U.S.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The United States on Thursday announced a pause on all routine visa applications for citizens of Zimbabwe, the latest restriction on travelers from Africa. Embassy in Zimbabwe would pause all routine visa services starting Friday “while we address concerns with the Government of Zimbabwe.” The embassy described the measure as temporary and part of the Trump administration's efforts to “prevent visa overstay and misuse.” Most diplomatic and official visas would be exempt from the pause, the U.S. Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia were all on that list of 36 countries asked to improve their citizens’ travel documentation and take steps to address the status of their nationals who are in the U.S. The new bond policy announced Tuesday requires Malawians and Zambians to pay bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or 15,000 as part of their application for a tourist or business visa to the U.S. Under the program, citizens of those countries must also arrive and depart at one of three airports; Boston’s Logan International Airport, New York's JFK International Airport or Dulles International Airport near Washington D.C.

Article: Myint Swe, who became Myanmar’s acting president under controversial circumstances after the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi more than four years ago, died on Thursday, the military said BANGKOK -- Myint Swe, who became Myanmar’s acting president under controversial circumstances after the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi more than four years ago, died on Thursday, the military said. State media announced in July last year that Myint Swe was suffering from neurological disorders and peripheral neuropathy disease, which left him unable to carry out normal daily activities, including eating. Myint Swe’s appointment and acquiescence to the army’s demands allowed the council to be convened to declare a state of emergency and hand over power to Min Aung Hlaing, who led the army’s takeover. During his time in office, Myint Swe could only perform the pro forma duties of his job, such as issuing decrees to renew the state of emergency, because Min Aung Hlaing controlled all government functions. Myint Swe, a former general, was a close ally of Than Shwe, who led a previous military government but stepped down to allow the transition to a quasi-civilian government beginning in 2011. Myint Swe was chief minister of Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, under the quasi-civilian government between 2011 and 2016, and headed its regional military command for years under the previous military government, which stepped down in 2011. During Buddhist monk-led popular protests in 2007 known internationally as the Saffron Revolution, he took charge of restoring order after weeks of unrest in the city, overseeing a crackdown that killed dozens of people.

(Hasnoor Hussain/Pool Photo via AP) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Thailand and Cambodia agreed Thursday to establish interim observer teams to monitor a fragile ceasefire that ended five days of of deadly armed border clashes, even as the fate of 18 Cambodian soldiers captured by Thailand remains unresolved. The first meeting of the General Border Committee concluded after four days of talks in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, with a focus on ensuring the full implementation of the ceasefire brokered by Malaysia on July 28. Dozens of people were killed and over 260,000 displaced on both sides of the Thai-Cambodian border, when fighting began after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. According to a joint statement from the committee, each country will set up its own interim observer team comprising defense officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and coordinated by the bloc's annual chair Malaysia, pending the deployment of a formal ASEAN observer mission. While both sides reaffirmed commitments to halt hostilities, freeze troop movement and avoid provocations, the issue of the 18 Cambodian soldiers captured just hours after the ceasefire took effect remains a sticking point. The joint statement did not directly mention them but it noted that the captives should be "immediately released and repatriated after the cessation of active hostilities.” It didn't clarify iwhether this refers to a formal end to the conflict. It said members of the International Committee of the Red Cross had visited them on Tuesday at their detention facility, and that the men were in good health and without any injury.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File) BANGKOK -- State prosecutors in Thailand have formally indicted 23 individuals and companies on charges related to the collapse of a Bangkok office building that collapsed after an earthquake, killing at least 92 people. The partially built high-rise, which was to house the new State Audit Office, was the only one in Thailand to completely collapse on March 28 due to the 7.7 magnitude earthquake, which was centered in neighboring Myanmar. The charges in the various indictments include professional negligence in design, supervision, or construction practices that failed to comply with engineering standards, resulting in danger to others and causing deaths, according to a statement from the Office of the Attorney General. The epicenter of the quake was in central Myanmar, where it killed more than 3,700 people and caused major damage in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city, and in the capital Naypyitaw.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump holds up the signed document after signing the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency, in the East Room of the White House, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via AP, File) NEW YORK -- Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. The new company — which will trade under the “PSKY” ticker on Wall Street — brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison. “Today marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount’s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment," Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to “honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content." The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.” By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together — pointing to “months of cowardly capitulation to this administration.” “In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement.

Article: A new federal report finds that most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, CDC report says Most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report. But Andrea Deierlein, a nutrition expert at New York University who was not involved in the research, suggested that there may be greater awareness of the potential harms of ultra-processed foods. Research published this week in the journal Nature found that participants in a clinical trial lost twice as much weight when they ate minimally processed foods — such as pasta, chicken, fruits and vegetables — than ultra-processed foods, even those matched for nutrition components and considered healthy, such as ready-to-heat frozen meals, protein bars and shakes. The new CDC report used the most common definition based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo. Such foods tend to be “hyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners and unhealthy fats,” the CDC report said.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) FILE - Shipping containers are loaded onto trucks at CSX Intermodal Terminals, a supplier of rail-based freight transportation, at CSX Queensgate Rail Yard, May 7, 2025, in Cincinnati. President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% last week, but a key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. “Canada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity.” ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.

Article: Russia’s space chief has visited the United States to discuss cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA’s acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years MOSCOW -- Russia’s space chief has visited the United States to discuss plans for continued cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA’s acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years. Dmitry Bakanov, the director of the state space corporation Roscosmos, met Thursday with NASA's new acting administrator, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, on a visit to attend the planned launch of a U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew to the space station. Roscosmos said Bakanov and Duffy discussed "further work on the International Space Station, cooperation on lunar programs, joint exploration of deep space and continued cooperation on other space projects.” Once bitter rivals in the space race during the Cold War, Roscosmos and NASA cooperated on the space station and other projects. As Russia has become increasingly reliant on China for its energy exports and imports of key technology amid Western sanctions, Roscosmos has started cooperation with China on its prospective lunar mission. Speaking to Russian reporters after the talks with Duffy, Bakanov said that they agreed to keep working on keeping the space station in operation to the end of the decade. “Our experts will now start working on those issues in details,” Bakanov said, praising Duffy for giving a green light for those contacts “despite geopolitical tensions.” The Russian space chief added that he and Duffy will report the results of the meeting to Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump to secure their blessing for potential space cooperation.

Article: Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. "We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That's what we want to do." Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would "take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said: "Well, we don't want to keep it. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who "look very hungry," that there is "real starvation" there and that "you can't fake that." Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said. officials briefed on the call described it as "a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid" in which Trump "was doing most of the talking." "The U.S. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option. The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. "Now all ideas are being exhausted." The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is "no chance they can kill every fighter." The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened. Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza. "Looking at the condition of hostages, it's clear that they don't have much more time," one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.

Article: Meta debuted the Instagram Map tool on Wednesday, pitching the feature as way to "stay up-to-date with friends" by letting users share their "last active location." The tool is akin to Snapchat's Snap Map feature that lets people see where their friends are posting from. Although Meta said in a blog post that the feature's "location sharing is off unless you opt in," several social media users said in posts that they were worried that was not the case. "Instagram randomly updating their app to include a maps feature without actually alerting people is so incredibly dangerous to anyone who has a restraining order and actively making sure their abuser can't stalk their location online…Why," said the user in a Threads post. "We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too," Mosseri wrote on Thursday. "We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share)." Still, some Instagram users claimed that that their locations were being shared despite not opting in to using the map feature. A Meta spokesperson reiterated Mosseri's comments in a statement and said "Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on." "If you do, only people you follow back — or a private, custom list you select — can see your location," the spokesperson said.

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post. But absolutely that jobs number, if the revision turns out to be true, does suggest that there's less momentum than we thought," said Hassett, director of the National Economic Council who is thought to be a leading contender for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. "What are we doing with a national average 30-year mortgage rate still close to 7% in an economy growing at 1%?" veteran economist and strategist Jim Paulsen wrote in a Substack post. "To me, today's jobs report is what entering a recession looks like," Josh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, wrote after the Friday report.

Article: The Israeli security cabinet has approved plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to occupy Gaza City, in an expansion of Israeli military operations that comes amid international condemnation of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. The decision, announced in a statement by the prime minister's office, came after a marathon meeting of the cabinet that lasted for some 10 hours, stretching into the early morning hours of Friday in Israel. "The IDF will prepare for the takeover of Gaza City while ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones." Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during an event at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Jerusalem on July 27, 2025. Gil Cohen-magen/AFP via Getty Images In the statement, the prime minister's office said the security cabinet by a majority vote adopted five principles for ending the war, including "Israel security control in the Gaza Strip." The other principles include: Disarming Hamas Returning all the hostages, including the bodies of those who have died The demilitarization of the Gaza Strip; and Establishing an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority The statement from the prime minister's office said a "decisive majority" of the ministers in the security cabinet believed that an unspecified alternative plan that was also considered "would achieve neither the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages." Before the meeting, Netanyahu said in a Fox News interview on Thursday that Israel "intends to" take control of all of Gaza, but "we don't want to keep it or govern it," he said. AFP via Getty Images Responding to Netanyahu's comments on Fox, Hamas said the prime minister's comments revealed the real reason Israel withdrew from the negotiations to reach a ceasefire deal. "Netanyahu's statements represent a blatant reversal of the negotiation process and clearly expose the real motives behind his withdrawal from the latest round of talks, despite us nearing a final agreement," Hamas said in a statement. "Netanyahu's plans to escalate the aggression confirm, without any doubt, that he is seeking to dispose of his captives and sacrifice them in service of his personal interests and extremist ideological agenda," Hamas continued. Demonstrators hold torches, during a protest outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, to demand the immediate release of the hostages kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, and the end of the war, in Jerusalem, August 7, 2025. "We are appealing to the cabinet -- the expansion of the fighting is a danger of death and immediate disappearance for our loved ones -- look us in the eye when you choose to sacrifice them," the Hostage Families Forum said in a statement. Two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News earlier this week that Netanyahu had decided to propose that the IDF move forward with a plan to fully conquer and occupy the Palestinian territory. Jack Guez/AFP via Getty Images On Sunday, an Israeli official told ABC News that Netanyahu was pushing to expand the military operation in Gaza on the grounds that he felt Hamas is not interested in reaching a new deal under which surviving hostages could be released. We are not in the business of interpreting statements from foreign governments when and if they're made." "We do remain focused on freeing the hostages, including the remains of two Americans, and ensuring that Hamas never rules Gaza again," Bruce said.

Article: The plan, announced early Friday local time after a Cabinet meeting that ran late into the night, stops short of the full occupation of the Gaza Strip that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had discussed earlier. The Israeli military "will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones," Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the meeting. NBC News reported earlier that commercial satellite images showed the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave. Critics have said taking over Gaza City would further endanger the remaining hostages held by Hamas, entrench the Israeli military even further into the conflict and result in a higher number of Palestinian civilian casualties. In an interview on Fox News in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israelis "intend to" take over Gaza "in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there" and pass the enclave "to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel." He said Israel, which already controls about three-quarters of Gaza, does not want to "keep" it long term. That's not possible with Hamas." A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that any new steps the Israeli government takes in Gaza will not succeed. "But it will fail." In recent weeks, global opinion about Israel's military actions in Gaza appears to have shifted as images of emaciated children have appeared in media outlets around the world. Finding food has become more difficult and deadly for Palestinians since an American and Israeli-backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took over the aid distribution process in late May.

(AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro addresses supporters during an event marking the anniversary of his disputed re-election and the birthday of late President Hugo Chavez, in Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, July 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) MIAMI -- The Trump administration is doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. “Under President Trump’s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video announcing the reward. Despite the big bounty, Maduro remains entrenched after defying the U.S., the European Union and several Latin American governments who condemned his 2024 reelection as a sham and recognized his opponent as Venezuela's duly elected president. Last month, the Trump administration struck a deal to secure the release of 10 Americans jailed in the capital, Caracas, in exchange for Venezuela getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Bondi said the Justice Department has seized more than $700 million in assets linked to Maduro, including two private jets, and said nearly 7 tons of seized cocaine had been traced directly to the leftist leader. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil released a statement characterizing the reward as “pathetic” and accusing Bondi of orchestrating a “crude political propaganda operation.” “We’re not surprised, coming from whom it comes from. The same one who promised a nonexistent ‘secret list’ of Epstein and who wallows in scandals for political favors,” Gil said, referring to the backlash Bondi faced after the Justice Department announced last month that a long-rumored “client list” of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein does not exist.

Article: Courts service 'covered up' IT bug that caused evidence to go missing Just now Share Save Alys Harte BBC File on 4 Investigates Share Save Getty Images The body running courts in England and Wales has been accused of a cover-up, after a leaked report found it took several years to react to an IT bug that caused evidence to go missing, be overwritten or appear lost. Sources within HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) say that as a result, judges in civil, family and tribunal courts will have made rulings on cases when evidence was incomplete. The internal report, leaked to the BBC, said HMCTS did not know the full extent of the data corruption, including whether or how it had impacted cases, as it had not undertaken a comprehensive investigation. PA Media Sir James Munby, the former head of the High Court's family division, describes the situation as "shocking" The bug was found in case-management software used by HMCTS, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) agency which administers many courts in England and Wales, and tribunals across the UK. Documents seen by the BBC show it caused data to be obscured from view, meaning medical records, contact details and other evidence were sometimes not visible as part of case files used in court. Sources have told the BBC that bugs have also impacted case management software used by other courts - including those dealing with family, divorce, employment, civil money claims and probate. "An error could mean the difference between a child being removed from an unsafe environment or a vulnerable person missing out on benefits." 'Culture of cover-ups' The BBC has spoken to several separate sources within HMCTS who liken the situation to the Horizon Post Office scandal, where executives tried to suppress evidence of the system's flaws. One says there was "general horror" at the design of the software, introduced by HMCTS in 2018, which they claim was "not designed properly or robustly" and had a long history of data loss. A briefing prepared for the chief executive of HMCTS - dated March 2024 - reveals the risk to proceedings was initially categorised as "high" with the possibility of court outcomes being adversely affected assessed as "very likely", resulting in "severe reputational impact to HMCTS". However, an initial manual investigation by a team within HMCTS reviewed only a subset of the most recent three months' worth of cases heard by the SSCS Tribunal, even though the bug was thought to have been in the system for several years. Their concerns are shared by a leading IT security expert, Prof Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey, who has worked for the UK government and consults on issues including forensic computing. "To say that they found no impact of these faults doesn't make sense to me." Leaked report Documents show an employee of HMCTS was so concerned, they raised a formal whistleblower complaint, which prompted a further internal investigation.

Article: The picture, snapped as alarm was growing over looming famine in Gaza and Israel pursued its pitiless military assault on the enclave, struck me as a maddening but apt illustration of the yawning gulf between the steadfast pro-Israel stance of leading Democratic politicians and their voters. Then last week Klobuchar did something that genuinely surprised me: She voted in favor of a pair of resolutions put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a leading critic of Israel’s prosecution of the war, that would block the transfer of key offensive weapons to Israel, including 1,000-pound bombs and automatic assault rifles.

Article: The bottled water scandal gripping France 38 minutes ago Share Save Hugh Schofield Paris correspondent Reporting from Vergèze Share Save Getty Images Major brands like Perrier are under the spotlight after the scandal broke in France France's multi-billion euro mineral water companies are under the spotlight because of climate change and growing concerns about the industry's environmental impact. It follows revelations in the French media about illicit filtration systems that have been widely used in the industry, apparently because of worries about water contamination, after years of drought linked to climate change. "It's a combination of industrial fraud and state collusion." "And now there is a real Sword of Damocles hanging over the head of Perrier." According to hydrologist Emma Haziza, "the commercial model of the big producers has worked very well. "When you have big brands that feel they have no choice but to treat their water – that means they know there is a problem with the quality." Getty Images EU law says natural mineral water should be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle The story hit the headlines a year ago in France after an investigation by Le Monde and Radio France revealed that at least a third of mineral water sold in France had been illegally treated, either with ultra-violet light, carbon filters or ultra-fine micro-meshes commonly used to screen out bacteria. The problem was that under EU law, "natural mineral water" – which sells at a huge premium over tap water – is supposed to be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle. If brands like Evian, Vichy and Perrier have been so successful in France and around the world, it is thanks to an appealing image of mountain-sides, rushing streams, purity and health-giving minerals. Complicating matters for Perrier and its parent company Nestlé – as well as President Emmanuel Macron's government – is the charge that executives and ministers conspired to keep the affair quiet, covered up reports of contamination, and re-wrote the rules so that Perrier could continue using micro-filtration. Aurelien Rousseau, who was head of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne's cabinet at the time, admitted there had been an "error of appreciation" but insisted there was never any risk to public health. Getty Images A senate report concluded that France's government covered up the water scandal "at the highest level" Earlier this year, at the senate hearing into the industry, Nestlé's CEO Laurent Freixe admitted that Perrier had indeed used illicit methods to treat its water. But he also had another admission: that an official hydrologists' report into the company's historic site in the Gard department in southern France had recommended against renewing "natural mineral water" status for the company's output. Far from the remote mountain landscape you might imagine, Perrier's water is pumped from deep aquifers in the coastal plain between Nîmes and Montpellier, a short drive from the Mediterranean. "For five years there was a succession of droughts, which were particularly badly felt in the south." Emma Haziza says climate change is causing a lot of problems in the south of France "All the aquifers were affected. We are moving from a period in which companies could draw water from the deep aquifers and be sure they would be replenished, to a period in which it's obvious the whole system cannot go on." The analysis made by Haziza and other hydrologists is that there is now a clear link between deeper and surface aquifers.

Article: Israel announces plan to take over Gaza City in another escalation of the war toggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP Israel's Security Cabinet approved a proposal early Friday for the military to expand the war in Gaza and take control of Gaza City, one of the last areas of the territory not yet under full military occupation. The announcement from the prime minister's office comes some 23 months into a war in which Israeli airstrikes and attacks have killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, a third of them children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Still, it's home to several of the territory's last partially-functioning hospitals, a church where Gaza's minority Christians are sheltering and where tens of thousands of displaced people have set up tent encampments. "He lied to me — he lied to all of us!" Public opinion in Israel is divided over whether to end the war, but this week tens of thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv for a ceasefire. Additionally, hundreds of former generals and security officials in Israel signed an open letter to President Trump, urging him to bring an end to the war and end the suffering. When asked this week about possible Israeli plans to militarily occupy all of Gaza, Trump said the decision was "pretty much up to Israel." The Security Cabinet, comprised of Israel's top leaders, adopted five aims before Israel ends the war: the disarmament of Hamas, the release of all roughly 50 hostages — less than half of whom are believed to be alive — demilitarizing Gaza, Israeli security control in Gaza and establishing a civil administration that is neither Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. The Security Cabinet's statement did not give any details on what Israeli security control in Gaza would need to look like for Israel to end the war, nor how a civil administration would be formed, what its role would be and who would run it. The prime minister's office said an alternative plan for military operations in Gaza than the one Netanyahu had presented had been rejected by the Security Cabinet, which includes two far-right ministers who've openly called for the permanent expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.

Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress.

Erin Patterson was convicted by a Victoria state Supreme Court last month of murdering her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail’s sister Heather Wilkinson at her home in Leongatha with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries contained toxic death cap mushrooms. Simon Patterson testified before the trial that he suspected his wife had deliberately made him seriously ill with dishes including penne bolognese pasta, chicken korma curry and a vegetable curry wrap. Defense lawyer Colin Mandy argued that reporting of the suppressed evidence as well as references to it in books, podcasts and a planned television mini-series would “leave an indelible impression on the minds of potential jurors in the event that there is a retrial.” A hearing will begin on Aug.

(Monique Ford/Stuff via AP) Two ships from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, JS Ise and destroyer JS Suzunami sail into Wellington, New Zealand to begin a three-day ceremonial port visit, Friday, Aug. (Monique Ford/Stuff via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Japanese warships docked in New Zealand ’s capital Friday for the first time in almost 90 years amid efforts by Tokyo to deepen its strategic ties in the South Pacific Ocean. The JS Ise and destroyer JS Suzunami were on an Indo-Pacific deployment and arrived from Sydney, where Japan’s military took part this month in war games involving New Zealand, Australia and other countries. The Wellington visit was a ceremonial one, but it came as Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions. “Our main goal is the free and open Indo-Pacific.” The ambassador’s remarks followed the announcement Tuesday by Australia’s government that Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had won the bid for a contract to build Australian warships, beating out a German firm. New Zealand too has sought to shore up its strategic and military relations in Asia as part of a foreign policy reset in recent years that the government says has turned more attention on Pacific cooperation and security. Japanese naval vessels do not often make visits so far south in the Pacific Ocean, but the rich and strategically important waters of New Zealand, Australia and smaller Pacific Island countries are increasingly contested by the world’s major powers, making it the site of a fierce battle for influence between Beijing and Western nations. In February, live firing exercises by Chinese naval frigates in the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia drew alarm from those countries’ governments after flights were forced to divert at short notice.

Article: The pet of choice in Japan, as much as cuddly kitties and playful puppies, is the humble bug Toyoji Suzuki holds a beetle, known as Hercules, at an exhibition devoted to insects in Tokyo, Thursday, July 31, 2025. The bug has been a key part of Japanese culture from the Heian era classic “The Tale of Genji” to popular modern-day manga and animation like “Mushishi,” featuring insect-like supernatural creatures. If you catch and study them, you’re sure to discover something new,” says Munetoshi Maruyama, professor of bioenvironmental sciences at Kyushu University, whose fascination with bugs began as a child, like many Japanese. “They are so beautiful in shape and form.” One thrill that comes from studying insects is discovering a new species, simply because there are more than 1.2 million known kinds of insects, far more than mammals, which translates to a lot of undiscovered ones, said Maruyama, who has discovered 250 new insect species himself and shrugs that off as a relatively small number. “It’s fantastic that bugs can serve as a doorway to science.” The fact some insects go through metamorphoses, transforming from a larva to a butterfly, for instance, adds to the excitement, allowing kids to observe the stages of a life span, Maruyama said. The love affair with bugs was clear at an exhibit in Tokyo, aptly called “The Great Insect Exhibition,” running through the end of this month at the Sky Tree Tower, where crowds of children gathered around trees inside indoor cages so they could observe and touch the various beetles. One kind of rhinoceros beetle known as Hercules, which originated in the Caribbean but is now also found in Japan, is reputed to be the biggest beetle on record, although it’s just several inches in length. That’s really positive for the workings of a child’s brain,” said Toyoji Suzuki, one of the event’s organizers, who insisted everyone, including adults, touch the bottom of the beetles’ horns and wings to feel how surprisingly soft and fluffy they are. Four-year-old Asahi Yamauchi, who was at the exhibit with his grandmother and getting his photo taken inside a special installation that made it look like he was inside a beetle, loves bugs as much as he loves dinosaurs and has what he called a cute beetle as a pet at home.

Article: David Mcnew | Getty Images News | Getty Images Top insurers fear the climate crisis could soon outpace industry solutions, effectively threatening to make entire regions around the world uninsurable. Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz , one of the world's biggest insurers, recently outlined how the world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for financial services, such as mortgages and investments. In a LinkedIn post published in late March, Thallinger made the case for rapid decarbonization, pointing out that entire asset classes were "degrading in real time" as extreme weather events take their toll. Thallinger, who is responsible for investment management and sustainability at Allianz, told CNBC that approximately two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are currently uninsured, indicating a "major societal problem." We are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. "If this volume just grows even more, we simply have a societal situation that is not bearable anymore because it is just too much risk that is no longer covered," Thallinger told CNBC by video call. It's very, very difficult to deal with these assets as an investor." The warning comes at a time when the world is on course for a temperature increase of as much as 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century, according to the United Nations, a level that would trigger "catastrophic" consequences for the planet. Allianz estimates that the cost of economic losses from natural catastrophes is typically around 10 times higher than the cost of adaptation, noting that this provides a clear economic incentive for policymakers to invest in preventative measures. "If we continue, however, with the policies that we have out there, we are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. Zurich Insurance Group , Europe's fifth-largest insurer, said in April alongside a research paper assessing climate resilience that the outlook looks "alarmingly bleak." The Swiss insurer cited the Los Angeles wildfires at the start of the year as a stark reminder that even the world's wealthiest economies are unprepared for the impact of increasing climate risks. On an inflation-adjusted basis, Zurich said that average insured losses rose by 5.9% per year between 1994 and 2023, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.7% annually over the same period. "If insured losses continue to grow at this rate, premiums for climate risk coverage will need to increase to reflect the additional risk," Zurich Insurance Group said in the paper. "This in turn, will affect the level of protection that individuals and businesses are willing and able to purchase, with potential consequences for the overall functioning of the market." CAT bonds For insurers and reinsurers, the increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events has coincided with astronomical growth in the catastrophe bond market. First created in the 1990s, so-called CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, said in a recent report that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down.

Article: government is loathe to admit it, but economists say it's highly likely that the Treasury will have to hike taxes in the fall if it is to bung a black hole in the public finances that it has effectively created for itself. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the latest economic think tank to warn that taxes would have to rise later this year if British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules." These rules target both a balanced or budget surplus by the end of the decade — with the so-called "stability rule" requiring that day-to-day spending is funded by tax revenues rather than borrowing — and that debt, as a proportion of GDP, should be falling by the end of this parliament (in 2029-30), aka the "investment rule." "The Government is not on track to meet its 'stability rule', with our forecast suggesting a current deficit of £41.2 billion in the fiscal year 2029-30," NIESR said in an economic outlook released Wednesday. With the government having fixed its spending plans for the next couple of years in its recent Spending Review, "the only lever available is to raise taxation in a moderate but sustained way," the think tank said in the report titled "the Chancellor's Trilemma." The 'trilemma' refers to the bind Reeves finds herself in thanks to her own fiscal rules, tax and spending commitments made over the last year and the Labour Party's manifesto promise to not raise taxes on "working people." "Simply put, the Chancellor cannot simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments, and uphold manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people.

Last month, local authorities rounded up hundreds of these workers, most of whom say they are Bengali-speaking Muslims from India's West Bengal state, in a "verification" drive targeting illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. "Why weren't the rich Bengali residents held up?" Zoya Mateen/BBC Ather Ali Sheikh (L) says authorities refused to accept his documents when he first produced them Police in Gurugram deny targeting any particular community. Zoya Mateen/BBC Most of these people do odd jobs such as cleaning, garbage-picking and driving in Gurugram's rich complexes In the north-eastern state of Assam, where the issue has been a potent flashpoint for decades, authorities have been "pushing back" hundreds of Bengali-Muslims into Bangladesh on suspicion of them being "illegal Bangladeshis". "When we finally spoke, he said he didn't call because he did not want any trouble." But it was not her husband's behaviour that bothered Rauna, or the fact that he was now jobless. This slum, the work we do and the houses we clean - this is our entire life." Zoya Mateen/BBC Rauna Bibi, who cleans homes in Gurugram, spent three long days with no information about her husband Mr Kumar says the recent action is based on a home ministry notice from May that lays down new guidelines for deporting illegal immigrants. Under the order, all states are required to set up a special task force along with holding centres to "detect, identify and deport/send back illegal immigrants settled from Bangladesh and Myanmar". "On the face of it, it's nothing other than the fact that you speak Bengali, have a Muslim name and live in shanty," said Aakash Bhattacharya, of the national council of the All India Central Council of Trade Unions which advocates for workers' rights. "This means they can be put through the same process again, making them extremely vulnerable."

Article: Air Force said Thursday it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. An Air Force spokesperson told The Associated Press that "although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved." About a dozen service members had been "prematurely notified" that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Air Force policy. Sponsor Message A memo issued Monday announcing the new policy, which was reviewed by the AP, said that the choice to deny retirement benefits was made "after careful consideration of the individual applications." All transgender members of the Air Force are being separated from the service under the Trump administration's policies. Separation process has hit some bumps The move comes after the Pentagon was given permission in early May by the Supreme Court to move forward with a ban on all transgender troops serving in the military. Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethannounced a policy that would offer currently openly serving transgender troops the option to either volunteer to leave and take a large, one-time separation payout or be involuntarily separated at later date. A Pentagon official told reporters in May that they viewed the policy as treating "anyone impacted by it with dignity and respect." However, in late July, transgender troops told Military.com that they were finding the entire separation process, which has included reverting their service records back to their birth gender, "dehumanizing" or "open cruelty." Shannon Leary, a lawyer who represents LGBTQ+ people in employment discrimination cases, says she expects lawsuits to challenge Thursday's decision. "These military members have dedicated their lives to serving our country." Sponsor Message Normally, Leary said, when early retirement is offered in the military, it's available to all members who have served over 15 years. Under the latest policy, active duty troops had until June 6 to voluntarily identify themselves and receive a payout while troops in the National Guard and Reserve had until July 7.

District Attorney Keith Higgins in February declined to charge Aldridge for fatally shooting Cure, saying body-camera video and other evidence indicated it was reasonable for Aldridge to use deadly force. “I think it helps our case tremendously considering it shows he had this propensity for excessive use of force and a propensity to lie about it on his reports,” Harry Daniels, the family’s lawyer, said of the indictment. In August 2021, it says, he unjustifiably tased a second victim in the in the back and compressed their neck using the pistol grip of a taser while they were handcuffed, also injuring them, and unjustifiably tased a victim in the back of the head in August 2023. He also falsely wrote that a victim ignored verbal commands and falsely reported that during the August 2021 occurrence, the victim ran away and he tried to use other force to control them before deploying a taser. 31, 2021, he was dispatched to a pickup truck that had been in a wreck on Interstate 95, and witnesses had reported seeing it weaving in the road, according to records previously obtained by the AP. (redacted) began defecating on himself.” Aldridge was hired by the Camden County Sheriff's office nine months after he was fired from another law enforcement job in 2017 after he threw a woman to the ground and handcuffed her during a traffic stop. “Finally, justice for some of these people that have been deprived of their civil rights at the hands of Buck Aldridge,” Camden County NAACP president Timothy Bessent said of the indictment. But he said he was glad to see federal prosecutors willing to hold Aldridge accountable for what he said was a pattern of dangerous behavior that should have stopped the Camden County Sheriff’s Office from hiring him in the first place.

Article: News Media Corp., an Illinois-based publisher, has announced the abrupt closure of dozens of newspapers across five states due to financial problems This provided photo shows the office of the Huron Plainsman in Huron, S.D., Thursday, Aug. News Media Corp., which owns local newspapers across five states, said it will close 14 operations in Wyoming, seven in Illinois, five in Arizona, four in South Dakota and one in Nebraska. has lost over one-third of its print newspapers and two-thirds of its newspaper journalists since 2004 as the news media has struggled to adopt to a changing readership and revenue landscape, according to the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University. “Unfortunately, due to financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company as a going concern, we have reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible,” company CEO J.J. Hundreds of employees were terminated immediately, and Tompkins wrote that the company will make “reasonable efforts to pay you all remaining compensation you have earned.” Staff took to social media to express their shock and disappointment at the news. “No one in Huron, nor any of the other papers, knew this was coming today,” Benjamin Chase, managing editor of the Huron Plainsman in South Dakota, said in a social media post. “We’re all in shock and attempting to figure out how to move forward.” Josh Linehan, managing editor of the Brookings Register in South Dakota, wrote in a letter to readers, “It’s no secret that it’s tough times out there for all print media, and we’re no exception." He added, “But make no mistake — we’re closed for now as a result of poor corporate management.” News Media Corp. “Obviously we all have websites and Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram and all that, but there’s a generation that doesn’t use that,” said Niemeyer, who at 65 prefers a printed newspaper. “It’s an entity that’s going to be irreplaceable.” The reasons behind newspaper closures are complex, with multiple factors at play, said Teri Finneman, a professor at the University of Kansas' journalism school and publisher of The Eudora Times. “This really needs to be a wake-up call to every town in this nation that your newspaper could be at risk as well and it is incumbent upon people to start supporting their newspapers through subscriptions and through advertising if we are going to keep critical news in these communities,” Finneman said.

(Azerbaijani Presidential Press Office via AP) WASHINGTON -- The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a peace deal Friday at the White House that could potentially put an end to decades of conflict, President Donald Trump said. to “pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.” “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,’” Trump wrote Thursday night on his Truth Social site. The prospective agreement could potentially put an end to decades of conflict and set the stage for a reopening of key transportation corridors across the South Caucasus that have been shut since the early 1990s. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreements included a major breakthrough establishing a key transit corridor across the region, which had been a hang-up in peace talks The agreement, according to the officials, would give the U.S. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fueled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years. When the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan. “Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine. The prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran. Turkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. “For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.

Article: Capital Economics says it expects the central bank to keep cutting at every meeting until it reaches a 3% base rate next year because it disagrees with its inflation forecasts, and says "it's only a matter of time" before labor market weakness leads to wage growth and inflation coming back down toward the Bank's target. But the firm says it's "less confident that the next cut will come in November after the Bank's change in tone." Economists at Santander UK are firmly in the opposite camp, with the lender citing "ugly inflation optics" and Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming budget as reasons it doesn't see another cut before the end of the year.

The appeal of the "dumbphone" FIO GEIRAN: We've seen people either trading in their phone and downgrading for a flip phone – or at least talking about it a lot and thinking that it might fix them. I think a lot of young people are seeing BlackBerrys kind of as the sweet spot between a flip phone that doesn't do too much and the modern smartphone that is doing way too much. MAGDA TAYLOR: I think that for the younger generation of people who are considered digitally native, many of us just simply don't really know another way of existing without being on our phones constantly. FIO GEIRAN: Yeah, I mean, I think this interest in dumbphones, I think there's a sense that older models of phones just seemed very fun in a lot of ways. How to renegotiate our relationships to our phones MAGDA TAYLOR: I think that the ubiquity of the phones and how they have become compulsory is just all the more evidence of how we do have some personal responsibility here to think about our relationship with this product that we only marginally have a choice in using now. And so I just think that we are at a point where we do need to be asking ourselves if this relationship with our phones is benefiting us, and if it's not quite giving us what we want from it, then what can we do to improve it? FIO GEIRAN: I think the best way to kind of get some space from it is to set yourself up in situations where you're feeling a pull to something bigger than your phone. Whether that's you spending time with nature or hanging out with friends, I think even having just solo time where you're being very, very intentional and trying to sit with yourself.

Article: Trust in Zelenskyy is diminished even after reversal of law that fueled protests FILE - Ukrainian lawmakers vote for a new bill proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to restore the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies at the parliament session hall in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) FILE - Ukrainian lawmakers vote for a new bill proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to restore the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies at the parliament session hall in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country’s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia’s invasion. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties. But the previous level of trust “that he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged," said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy "will need to work hard to get it back.” A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law. The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore “lost trust.” Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, or SAPO. The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime. “It’s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,” Shevchuk said. Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions. Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy’s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported that the NABU and the SAPO were in the process of issuing a formal notice of suspicion against the businessman, who is involved in drone production. "But at the same time, people know what is happening with the close allies of the president, the allegations of corruption, so this does not go unnoticed.” The protests "were a reminder to the president from the people basically saying, ‘We see everything, remember everything. A readout of the call from Starmer’s office said the leaders "agreed on the importance of the role of independent anti-corruption institutions at the heart of Ukraine’s democracy.” In Germany, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed dismay when Zelenskyy approved the measures to reduce the powers of the NABU and the SAPO.

Article: Voyager Technologies clinched a $3.8 billion valuation two months ago, as the defense and space company's stock opened 125% higher on Wednesday at $69.75 apiece, above its $31 offer price. On Thursday, Northrop Grumman-backed Firefly Aerospace — whose Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down on the Moon earlier this year — surged in its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol FLY. This might seem like a small step for some industries, but it's a giant leap for traditional offerings for the space sector, where for some time players such as Intuitive Machines, Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile listed by way of mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) — shell firms that pool their IPO proceeds to consolidate with a private company and take it public, bypassing some of the typical regulatory scrutiny. But recent geopolitical volatility triggered by the conflict in the Middle East and by Washington's protectionist trade policies have cast a shadow over global appetite for dealmaking and going public, bankers have mentioned anecdotally. "Companies aligned with national priorities and innovation, and those able to present a credible equity story with realistic valuations and flexible timing, are likely to succeed in navigating this complex environment." Space companies, by definition, tick at least some of those boxes. Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPOX, qualified this is "definitely a good time for Space IPOs," with initiatives like the U.S.' push for the Golden Dome missile interception system fueling high valuations. "Still, most firms in the sector are dependent on foreign-made satellite components, creating a vulnerability to cost increases and deployment delays caused by trade disputes." He nevertheless warned that the "intensifying" competition in the private launch market — where companies are looking to reduce costs, particularly by deploying reusable tech and infrastructure — could create "downward pressure on costs." "This will be a key factor in lowering the sector's high entry barriers, making a new generation of space-based business models commercially feasible," Muehlbauer noted. These companies are not being valued on near-term cash flow, but on their ability to deliver long-term strategic infrastructure," Cristiano Dalla Bona, who heads North America ECM analysis at Mergermarket, said in emailed comments. Still, the credibility and visibility on growth of each new candidate will likely be scrutinized." The sector has also been firmly in the public eye, with headlines ranging from NASA layoffs, Elon Musk's vocal involvement with — and later explosive exit from — the White House and Trump's push for the Golden Dome missile interception system.

Article: Tea Dating Advice, an app designed as a safe space for women to anonymously discuss men they’ve dated, faces mounting legal challenges after a data breach last month exposed users’ personal information and images. The women who filed the suits accuse Tea Dating Advice Inc., the company behind the viral app, of failing to properly safeguard their personally identifiable information after images of users’ government IDs containing their full names and addresses were leaked online. Founded in 2023, the Tea app says it allows users to perform criminal background checks on potential dates, enter photos from a dating app profile into a reverse image search and search dates’ phone numbers. Advertisement The hack was first reported by 404 Media, which said users on the online forum 4chan claimed to have uploaded the images of women and their IDs to the site, long known for its discussion boards containing racist, extremist and misogynistic content. The app, “which marketed itself as a sanctuary where women could anonymously warn each other about dangerous men, instead became the very threat it promised to protect against,” reads one lawsuit, filed by a woman listed anonymously as Jane Doe. The women behind the lawsuits include a single mother from Nevada fleeing domestic violence, as well as a woman from Northern California who used the app to warn others about a man who allegedly sexually assaulted two women in her community, according to court documents. Advertisement A third plaintiff, Griselda Reyes, says in her complaint that she now “has anxiety and increased concerns for the loss of privacy, as well as anxiety over the impact of cybercriminals accessing, using and selling” her private information. “The nature of the application was to provide a forum, a vehicle for women to share very sensitive information about their dating lives with one another, the idea being, of course, that they could do that in a protected forum, thereby helping each other,” Scott Cole, Reyes’s attorney, told The Washington Post. “What strikes me most about this case as being unique is just the level of trust that these women placed in Tea Dating, which, of course, was violated,” said Cole, whose law firm specializes in data breach cases. In a July statement, Tea said that it had detected “unauthorized access to our systems” and that about 72,000 images had been exposed, including some 13,000 images of photo identification documents and selfies submitted as part of the user verification process.

Article: More controversially, in New York City and Rhode Island, nonprofits have run government-sanctioned “overdose prevention” centers, where people can use illicit drugs under the supervision of staffers trained to revive them if they collapse. But elements of the strategy known as harm reduction are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who in July barred certain federal grants from funding programs he said enable illegal drug use. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration — while blessing the use of federal funds for distribution of naloxone and fentanyl test strips — in a letter published July 29 said the “ideological concept of harm reduction” had been used to advocate for policies that are “incompatible” with the administration’s priorities. In Kentucky, a red state that has been among the hardest hit by the opioid crisis, staff members at Kentucky Harm Reduction Coalition fear the Trump administration’s rhetoric may lead local leaders to strip funding in the coming year. Advertisement Officials at SAHMSA were asked to review online documents and webpages that mention harm reduction for removal or editing, according to an email reviewed by The Washington Post and an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal Health and Human Services matters. Asked about the webpage removals, an HHS spokesperson said the administration believes “federal funding provided by the American taxpayer goes to effective, common-sense solutions that keep people out of cyclical crisis and move them into a life of recovery.” The executive order was aimed primarily at ending “endemic vagrancy” and disorderly drug-fueled crime that the administration asserts has made U.S. Advertisement To do so, the order pushes HHS to prohibit “discretionary” grants for harm reduction efforts “that only facilitate illegal drug use.” The order also vowed to end federal funding for programs that “fail to achieve adequate outcomes,” but does not define the standard. “If our leaders are serious about reducing overdoses and building safer communities, they must invest in what works: stable housing, overdose prevention centers, syringe service programs, and accessible treatment,” said Maritza Perez Medina, director of federal affairs at Drug Policy Alliance, a left-leaning group that advocates for harm reduction. “It’s alarming that cities using proven, lifesaving interventions could be punished for doing exactly what public health demands.” A long history Harm reduction programs grew as hundreds of thousands in the United States died of overdoses, peaking in 2022 at about 110,000 dead. Research funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in March concluded that between 2013 and 2020, states with more robust harm reduction policies, as scored by experts, were associated with reduced overdose risk. In a May budget document, the Trump administration said SAMHSA grants under Biden had been used to fund “dangerous” harm reduction activities, including money for syringe exchanges and supplies for “safe smoking,” which some public health advocates assert may be less lethal than injecting. In last week’s letter, SAHMSA said its funds can no longer be used to “support poorly defined so-called ‘harm reduction,’” activities, including for purchase of drug paraphernalia or “any other supplies to promote or facilitate drug use.” It stressed the administration’s “common-sense” approach focusing on prevention, treatment and long-term recovery. Advertisement Some government leaders and policy experts push back on the influence of progressive harm reduction organizations for messaging that destigmatizes illicit substance use, and has included controversial pushes for decriminalization of certain drug crimes. Those groups have twisted the public’s conception of harm reduction, giving the Trump administration ammo to bash the strategy even while publicly supporting naloxone and fentanyl test strip distribution, said Keith Humphreys, a former White House drug policy adviser during the Obama administration. But by law, federal dollars cannot be used to buy syringes, smoking supplies or directly fund overdose prevention centers anyway, said Rahul Gupta, former director of Biden’s White House Office of National Drug Control and Policy. The Justice Department argued it violated a decades-old law banning venues that operate “for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.” The legal fight continues; in July, an appeals court ruled the nonprofit can sue the government on allegations of violating religious freedom. Philadelphia Councilmember Quetcy Lozada (D), whose district includes the drug-ravaged Kensington neighborhood, slams mobile harm reduction groups for drawing crowds of users who shoot up outside residents’ homes and trash streets. Researchers in 2023 found that neighborhoods around the New York overdose preventions centers did not experience a significant increase in calls for police or emergency services, despite concerns from community members about crime spurred by the facilities.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) FILE 0 United States Vice President JD Vance, right, and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Feb. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday at a stately home south of London before heading off on a family vacation in the the Cotswolds, a trendy retreat in the English countryside. Vance and Lammy, who come from opposite ends of the political spectrum but have made a personal connection through their hardscrabble childhoods and Christian faith, will hold talks at the foreign secretary’s official country residence, known as Chevening. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also likely to be on the agenda amid debates between Washington and London about the best way to end those conflicts. Lammy and Vance will meet at Chevening, an almost 400-year-old mansion surrounded by 3,000 acres (about 1,200 hectares) of gardens, lawns and woodland in the county of Kent, southeast of London. While Lammy is a member of the left-leaning Labour Party and Vance is a conservative Republican who supports Trump’s “America First” agenda, the two men have bonded in recent months. Lammy told the Guardian newspaper that the two men can relate over their “dysfunctional” working class childhoods and that he considers Vance a “friend.” Lammy attended a Catholic Mass at the Vance home in Washington earlier this year, and the two men met again at the U.S. “So it was a wonderful hour and a half.” After spending a few days at Chevening, Vance and his family will head to the Cotswolds, an area that has become popular with wealthy American tourists because of its quaint villages, stone cottages and rural countryside that hark back to old England.

Article: The Associated Press has assembled a chronology of chaotic rescue efforts as a flash flood barreled through the Hill Country of Central Texas before dawn July 4 By CLAUDIA LAUER Associated Press , GENE JOHNSON Associated Press , JAMIE STENGLE Associated Press , and MARK THIESSEN Associated Press FILE - Camper's belongings sit outside one of Camp Mystic's cabins near the Guadalupe River, July 7, 2025, in Hunt, Texas, after a flash flood swept through the area. (AP Photo/Eli Hartman, file) FILE - Camper's belongings sit outside one of Camp Mystic's cabins near the Guadalupe River, July 7, 2025, in Hunt, Texas, after a flash flood swept through the area. Using recordings of first responder communications, weather service warnings, survivor videos and official testimony, The Associated Press has assembled a chronology of the chaotic rescue effort as a flash flood barreled east through the Hill Country of Central Texas before dawn on July 4. The flooding killed at least 136 people — including more than two dozen children and counselors at Camp Mystic, a century-old summer camp for girls that was among the first areas inundated. Here are some of the harrowing moments: In a Slack chat, a National Weather Service forecaster tells emergency managers, meteorologists and news media that the agency is monitoring Kerr County, but so far there has been little rain. Geological Survey river gauge about a half mile (0.8 km) east of Hunt is already recording almost 24 feet (7.3 meters) of water – considered major flood stage for the Guadalupe River. A crew of rescuers from San Antonio arrive to help, but with no command center established, they wait for instructions in a fast food parking lot — less than 2 river miles (3.2 km) from the RV park. “If you could, see if Kerrville's got a crew that they could set up at Bear Creek off Arcadia and see if they could pick up any of the people that are washing by us,” one asks a dispatcher. Testimony from Kerr County leaders at a legislative hearing at the end of July would confirm that the county’s top official was out of town, the sheriff was asleep and the emergency management coordinator was sick in bed when the floods and the emergency response began. “Please advise when you have an assignment for us.” As daylight breaks, emergency personnel are able to see the catastrophic scope of the flooding from the air, but rescuers keep struggling to find and reach survivors. For many families holding out hope of having their loved ones returned, it would take days or weeks due to the massive amount of debris and the widespread search area along the Guadalupe River. The waters rose quickly in the middle of the night, and hard-hit Kerr County lacked an updated flood warning system; state and local agencies had missed opportunities to finance one.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states Things to know about the Voting Rights Act and the cases that could unravel it FILE - Luci Baines Johnson looks at the desk May 16, 2023, on display at the LBJ Presidential Library, that President Lyndon B. His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

In a Tuesday announcement, Meta said it was also rolling new tools on WhatsApp to help people spot scams — including a new safety overview that the platform will show when someone who is not in a user’s contacts adds them to a group, as well as ongoing test alerts to pause before responding. Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram, pointed to recent scam efforts that it said attempted to use its own apps — as well as TikTok, Telegram and AI-generated messages made using ChatGPT — to offer payments for fake likes, enlist people into a pyramid scheme and/or lure others into cryptocurrency investments.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.

(Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

(Vertical Entertainment via AP) Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. But it’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work. It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I’ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she’s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto). Miller’s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest “Dame Of Darkness” is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. There’s lots of fretting over why Katherine won’t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. But coherency of the vision is limited, as is the audience’s investment, though there are some lovely and inspired touches like using Iranian artist Reza Riahi to hand paint several animated flashback vignettes based on her memories of her fathers. Thomas co-wrote the script with her husband, journalist John Micklethwait, which includes a particularly poignant monologue for her character telling her daughters, essentially, to grow up and move on — a mature and worthy statement that might come a bit too late. But Thomas did have the good sense to end with a song that might just conjure up some feelings for any “Heartburn” fans out there: Carly Simon’s “Coming Around Again,” this time a duet with Alanis Morissette.

(AP Photo, left and New York Post Pool via AP) NEW YORK -- After teaming up on a bestseller about the murder of four University of Idaho students, James Patterson and Vicky Ward are collaborating on a book about the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and the hunt for his alleged killer, Luigi Mangione. Patterson, one of the world's bestselling novelists, and Ward, an investigative reporter who has worked at CNN and Esquire, plan to draw upon exclusive interviews, firsthand reporting and court transcripts, among other sources. Patterson's and Ward's “The Idaho Four,” published last month, quickly became a national bestseller after Bryan Kohberger was sentenced July 23 to four consecutive life sentences without parole for the fatal stabbings of students Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves in 2022.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) LOS ANGELES -- If there’s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie “Weapons,” it’s that the best laughs won’t come from the jokes he writes. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious — a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie’s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are “opposite side of the same coin.” “It’s funny because this isn’t even like a proper horror film,” Garner said. “It has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it’s kind of its own genre, in a way.” The town’s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Yet, when Garner’s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage. “We definitely have a, ‘Whoa, not my problem,’ kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we’re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it’s happening in front of us,” Cregger said. “Living in America, I’ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I’ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don’t know, it feels real.” Brolin — who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, “The Goonies,” to the Marvel universe — initially hesitated when approached for the film. How do you deal?” For Ehrenreich, who’s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, “Weapons” offered a different pace, but its horror wasn’t what drew him in. “The weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I’ve read in years,” Ehrenreich said.

Article: The chief weakness of “Freakier Friday” — which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion — is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. I’ll admit to laughing out loud — with everyone else older than 30 near me — when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: “It’s like a database of old people!” Touché, guys. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.) Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is “Rebelling with Respect.” Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out “Make good choices!” — just what mom Tess used to say, natch. “Freakier Friday,” a Walt Disney Studios release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association “for thematic elements, rude humor, language and some suggestive references.” Running time: 111 minutes.

Article: Technicians stand next to an oil rig which is manufactured by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant, during a media tour of the plant in Dhamasna village in the western state of Gujarat, India, August 26, 2021. President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

Article: "India is [a] country with a deep sense of self as an independent actor," he said, adding it will "never play deputy to any sheriff." That marks a stark reversal from earlier optimism, when Modi and Trump aimed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating." "All bets are off now," he added. India's External Affairs Ministry responded sharply to criticism over Russian oil purchases Tuesday, calling it "unjustified and unreasonable." The ministry also pointed out that Western nations criticizing India are themselves continuing to trade with Russia. Nikki Haley urged the administration not to "burn a relationship with a strong ally like India," highlighting that China, which is Russia's top oil buyer, received a 90-day tariff pause in May. Former Indian Finance Secretary Subhash Garg echoed that sentiment on CNBC's " Inside India " Tuesday: "Our positions are so different that there is very little possibility of a reconciliation." He suggested India should absorb the export hit and diversify to domestic or alternative markets.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

Article: The move was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes after the Reserve Bank of India delivered an outsized cut of 50 basis points at its last meeting in June. On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." While domestic growth remains "resilient," the central bank noted that the outlook for external demand is still "uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations." "The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, persisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to the growth outlook." During the RBI's last meeting, Malhotra said that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the 50-basis-point cut in June. As such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative." This means that the Monetary Policy Committee, which is the RBI's key decision-making body, will carefully assess the "incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy," Malhotra said. However, the BofA analysts left the door open for a possible rate cut later this year — likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 — once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. The RBI also maintained its GDP growth forecast for its financial year ending March 2026 at 6.5%, but cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous projection of 3.7%. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee also said on Wednesday that the near-term inflation outlook has "become more benign than anticipated earlier," while inflation in 2025 is expected to remain significantly below the central bank's target of 4%.

"If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy." Last month, Trump likened the trade deal with Japan, which includes a pledge of $550 billion in investment, to "seed money." "Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Moreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview. "The European Union and her Member States have very limited capabilities to direct private actors to make these purchases and investments," David Kleimann, a trade expert and senior research associate at ODI Europe, told CNBC.

"The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff. This tactic worked during Trump's first term, with the EU demonstrating soaring LNG and soybean imports from the US." Underlining problems with the feasibility of the EU's energy pledge, Peker said even if the bloc bought all U.S. 'A negotiating tactic' "I think it is a negotiating tactic, but I would have expected the EU to come up with the first round to be more realistic and more favorable to the EU," Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, lead energy analyst for the Europe team at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told CNBC by video call. She pointed out that for the EU to meet its annual commitment of $250 billion of energy products over the next three years, the EU would need to source about 70% of its energy imports from the country, a prospect that raises supply security concerns.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Egon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets.

Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: "The Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the president is open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelenskiy." The details emerged following a meeting on Wednesday between Putin and U.S. A Kremlin aide said the talks were "useful and constructive." The diplomatic maneuvers come two days before a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions. The White House official earlier said that while the meeting between Witkoff and Putin had gone well and Moscow was eager to continue engaging with the United States, secondary sanctions that Trump had threatened against countries doing business with Russia were still expected to be implemented on Friday. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the Ukraine issue and discussed the possibility of developing strategic cooperation between Moscow and Washington, but declined to give more details until Witkoff had reported back to Trump.

Article: (Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images) The White House announced Wednesday that it is imposing an additional 25% tariff on India, bringing the total levies against the major United States trading partner to 50%. "Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent," the executive order reads. It's the latest sign that Trump is following through on his threat to punish countries that buy Russian oil, as he's increased his rhetoric in recent weeks over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The tariffs against India came as Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Wednesday in Moscow with Putin, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. A White House official said the meeting "went well" and "the Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States." The secondary tariffs that Trump has threatened against countries that buy Russian oil are still expected to be implemented Friday, the official said. "We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India," an official spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs said.

The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men. Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as "very manual" and "not efficient." It is "something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were," he said.

Article: Brazil's Supreme Court put former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday ahead of his trial for an alleged coup plot, underscoring the court's resolve despite escalating tariffs and sanctions from U.S. In an interview with Reuters last month, Bolsonaro called Moraes a "dictator" and said the restraining orders against him were acts of "cowardice." Some Bolsonaro allies have worried that Trump's tactics may be backfiring in Brazil, compounding trouble for Bolsonaro and rallying public support behind Lula's leftist government. However, Sunday demonstrations by Bolsonaro supporters — the largest in months — show that Trump's tirades and sanctions against Moraes have also fired up the far-right former army captain's political base. Bolsonaro appeared virtually at a protest in Rio de Janeiro via phone call to his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, in what some saw as the latest test of his restraining orders. sanctions against the judge, adding: "I hope the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this person (Moraes) causing so much upheaval." The judge's orders, including the restraining orders under penalty of arrest, have been upheld by the wider court. Those orders and the larger case before the Supreme Court came after two years of investigations into Bolsonaro's role in an election-denying movement that culminated in riots by his supporters that rocked Brasilia in January 2023. In contrast with the tangle of criminal cases which mostly stalled against Trump, Brazilian courts moved swiftly against Bolsonaro, threatening to end his political career and fracture his right-wing movement. In a statement after the arrest on Monday, Congressman Bolsonaro called Moraes "an out-of-control psychopath who never hesitates to double down." Trump last month shared a letter he had sent to Bolsonaro. The arrest could give Trump a pretext to pile on additional measures against Brazil, said Graziella Testa, a political science professor at the Federal University of Parana, adding that Bolsonaro seemed to be consciously provoking escalation. "I think things could escalate because this will be seen as a reaction to the Magnitsky sanction" against Moraes, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner at the Think Policy political risk consultancy in Brasilia, referring to the asset freeze imposed on Moraes last week.

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's .

Amanda Lewis, who spent close to a decade scrutinizing mergers at the FTC and is now a partner at Cuneo Gilbert and LaDuca, previously told CNBC the merger is unlikely to raise many concerns because combined, Dick's and Foot Locker would represent around 15% of the sporting goods market.

Article: Disney reported results for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday – posting earnings that topped expectations but revenue that came in just shy of analyst projections – as the company's streaming business grew and its theme parks saw higher spending from consumers. "Just as a reminder, it was only a couple of years ago that we were losing a billion dollars a quarter on that business," Johnston told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. We now really have a solid foundation."

Article: The mall-based boutique, long known for its ear piercing services and eclectic mix of jewelry and accessories, is staring down about $500 million in debt, rising competition and an evolving retail landscape that's made it harder than ever to grow a business profitably. Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire's and its stakeholders," CEO Chris Cramer said in a news release. "We remain in active discussions with potential strategic and financial partners and are committed to completing our review of strategic alternatives." The company said stores will continue to operate as it looks to monetize its assets and continues a review of "strategic alternatives," which could mean finding a buyer that's willing to keep the business running. Tariffs are expected to impact its supply chain, and sleeker, savvier competitors have entered the market, such as Studs and Lovisa, the upstart ear piercing chains that have promised a safer, and cooler, approach to piercings. This is more attuned to what younger consumers want and has left Claire's looking somewhat out of step with modern demand," GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note.

Article: The EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website . Landlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away," said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform. Cambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists. "It's a $32 million program for the government, but it provides, in terms of return on investment — it's huge," said Nicole Upano, director of public policy for the NAA. "It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program." If Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of." An mRNA model is placed in front of the "Area 100 R&D" research laboratory for personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccines at a new facility of BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, on July 27, 2023.

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

A collapsed state Syria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group. Yosri Aljamal | Reuters The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December 2024 stunned the global community and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country.

However, federal government employment continued to decline, down 12,000 for the month and 84,000 since its January peak, before Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began paring down the jobs rolls. And now the test we have is really to figure out, to what extent is this slowdown likely to persist and get us into a more troublesome position," Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC.

Article: Businesses breathed a sigh of relief in April when the country swerved initial plans for a 31% tariff, being handed an interim 10% duty along with most of the world. Another potential reprieve came as the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs told Reuters on Friday it understands the 39% tariff will not include the pharmaceutical sector, which is separately facing volatility from Trump's latest comments on drug pricing. Switzerland's federal council said it had "great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." It added that it continued to seek a "negotiated solution" and was in contact with U.S. Manufacturing association Swissmem said a 39% tariff would hit the tech industry, exports and therefore the whole country "extremely hard," noting that every second franc brought into the economy was made from foreign trade. "This will lead to a weakening of the Swiss economy, the Swiss Franc and the Swiss equity market, particularly the all-important export sector." watch now The Swiss government needs to recognize that the time for "cherry picking, carve outs and special deals" is over, particularly for small, highly-exposed states, Wittmann added. Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that a 39% tariff rate would knock around 0.6% off Switzerland's GDP, or more with the inclusion of pharmaceuticals — but that he expected it to be negotiated down. watch now With the Swiss stock market closed for national day, indicators are instead feeding through other avenues such as the performance of London-listed Watches of Switzerland, which fell nearly 9% in morning deals. In a Friday note to clients, analysts at investment bank Jefferies cited the company, along with Richemont and Swatch Group, as among those that would take the biggest hits from the news, particularly relative to previous expectations. The rally has delivered challenges to the economy, which in May marked a return to deflation for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic — spurring the Swiss National Bank to cut interest rates to zero in June. 'I do not think it is the end' Rahul Sahgal, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" the tariff news was "very disappointing" after many rounds of negotiations with the U.S.

Article: That topped the Dow Jones estimate for 2.3% and helped reverse a decline of 0.5% for the first quarter that came largely due to a huge drop in imports, which subtract from the total, as well as weak consumer spending amid tariff concerns. "The consumer is hanging in there, but still on edge until the trade deals are done." The period reported Wednesday includes President Donald Trump's April 2 "liberation day" tariff announcement. "The anti Trump story has been that we're going to have a recession or a depression because of the tariffs, which are going to jack up prices and cause consumers to run for the exits" Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, said on CNBC. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a metric that Fed watches closely as a demand indicator, rose just 1.2%, down from the 1.9% increase in Q1 and the slowest gain since the fourth quarter of 2022.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) The Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.” “Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” she said. The new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York, California and Connecticut, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois. The administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a “non-sanctuary city.” The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a “Page Not Found” error message. The administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York.

Article: President Donald Trump's latest tariffs, a sharp departure from the steep selloff triggered by his April 2 announcement of "reciprocal" duties, as investors grow increasingly numb to what they see as a negotiating tactic. India, targeted in part over its continued purchases of Russian oil, saw its tariffs jump from an earlier 25% to 50% on Wednesday on a broad range of goods . I think there's also a lot of precedent in terms of things being announced and then rolled back later," said Steve Brice, global chief investment officer at Standard Chartered Bank's wealth solutions unit. Investors' indifference towards Trump's tariff threats recalls a term for his pattern of announcing hefty tariff threats that jolt markets, only to scale them back or delay them, which was coined as "Trump Always Chickens Out" — or TACO . The markets bought into Trump's rhetoric in April when he said that his initial tariff positions were his final offer, which explains why equity markets fell heavily, said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds. "I think the markets are becoming a bit numb to the permanent volatility on these issues," he said, adding that markets attempted to price these in back in April and May, but pauses and repeated negotiations since then have made the markets "incapable of pricing it in any concrete manner." "The market is just not capable of pricing it in because of the chronic uncertainty," he said. On Wednesday, Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States." "Building a plant may cost hundreds of millions.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith) Cambodian Buddhist monks march on a street as they organize a ceremony to offer prayers to the remains of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in battles with Thai troops along the disputed border areas, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Friday, Aug. (AP Photo/Heng Sinith) PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Hundreds of Buddhist monks in Cambodia on Friday held a religious ceremony to honor soldiers killed in recent border clashes with Thai forces and to pray for peace. They marched from the country’s main religious school near the Royal Palace in the capital, Phnom Penh, to a nearby temple, where they were joined by nuns and laymen and women. A ceasefire that took effect on July 29 ended major fighting, though both sides have alleged violations of the truce and the underlying dispute over territorial claims has not been resolved. Khem Sorn, the chief monk for Phnom Penh, said the main purpose of Friday’s ceremony was to show support to the government for working toward peace and ending the war with a ceasefire. It was also intended to honor to the souls of the Cambodian soldiers and civilians who were killed, and to appeal to all Buddhist countries, especially Thailand, to live in peace with each other, he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Talks in Malaysia on Thursday reaffirmed both sides’ commitment to the ceasefire deal but failed to secure the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers, who were captured in disputed circumstances after the truce went into effect. The United States and China, which both played an active role in encouraging an end to the fighting, separately hailed Thursday’s reaffirmation of the ceasefire, and said they look forward to supporting the parties involved in securing the peace process.

Israel captured much of Gaza City in the first months of war, seizing some areas more than once, before relinquishing it all on the false assumption that Hamas had been defeated.

Manaure Quintero | Afp | Getty Images South Korea has tasked some of its biggest companies and promising startups to build a national foundational AI model using mainly domestic technology, in a rare move to keep the country apace with the U.S. The project will feature South Korean technologies from semiconductors to software, as Seoul looks to create a near self-sufficient AI industry and position itself as an alternative to China and the U.S. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness," Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC. "This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents," Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. Meanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon . The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called "A." which is pronounced "A dot." Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot. Any AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek. "Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic," Kim told CNBC. An open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.

Article: Fallon/AFP via Getty Images After years of booming tourism in Las Vegas, the hot streak looks to be cooling off — and it may be a tell for the broader economy. For the sixth consecutive month this year, Las Vegas experienced a decline in the number of visitors year-over-year — with June seeing nearly 400,000 fewer visitors or an 11.3 percent drop compared to the same time last year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA). Sponsor Message In its June report, the LVCVA said the dip in tourism reflected "broader backdrop of persistent economic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence." What happens in Las Vegas matters on a national scale because it often reflects larger trends, according to Andrew Woods, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. By the numbers Both hotel occupancy rate and convention attendance in Las Vegas fell several percentage points this June compared to the same period last year, according to the LVCVA. International tourism takes a toll Among the biggest blows has been the loss of visitors from Canada, who make up the biggest share of Las Vegas' international market, according to Woods. more broadly, there was a drop in international travelers from nearly every region in the world in June compared to last year, according to a preliminary summary from the National Travel and Tourism Office. More Americans intend to take vacations this summer compared to last year, but they plan to do so with a smaller budget, according to a survey by Deloitte's ConsumerSignals that was released in May. What's in store for Las Vegas Economists say it's too early to determine whether the recent decline in Las Vegas is temporary or marks the beginning of a long-term trend. "Because if they are confident enough to make those decisions, that is telling a lot about the health of our economy here in Las Vegas." Lovat is hopeful that tourism will pick up in the coming months. He believes that some travelers held off their Las Vegas trip in anticipation of upcoming major events, including concerts by Paul McCartney and the Backstreet Boys, as well as Formula 1 racing and the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Article: The reactor would launch to the moon by 2030, according to a directive by Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy that was sent to NASA officials in July and obtained by NPR. The plan follows the United States' goal to return astronauts to the moon and be a leader in space exploration as China and Russia also aim to use nuclear power on the moon by the end of the decade. Duffy said during a press conference on Tuesday that using nuclear energy as a power source on the moon is necessary to sustain life there – and that the U.S. Nuclear reactors on the moon work in much the same way as reactors on Earth, according to Bhavya Lal, a former associate administrator for technology, policy and strategy at NASA. Moreover, even if something did happen on the surface, "there's no wind, there's no water that would move the radioactivity around," says Patrick McClure, the chief operating officer of SpaceNukes, a company developing space-based nuclear reactors. Kathryn Huff, professor of nuclear, plasma, and radiological engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said a nuclear reactor being on the moon is not the primary safety issue — the main concern is getting the reactor up there and what happens once it reaches the end of its lifespan. "If you're considering bringing that reactor off the moon someday, making sure that its reentry into the Earth's atmosphere is flawless will be pretty important because I think no one really wants to see a repeat of the Kosmos 954 [incident]." Sponsor Message Kosmos 954, a nuclear-powered satellite by Russia, malfunctioned in January 1978 while reentering Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Canada, spreading radioactive debris across the country. A fiscal year 2026 budget request released in May would reduce funding for the agency by about 24%, from nearly $25 billion to nearly $19 billion — though the House and Senate are discussing recommendations that would keep funding for the agency around the current budget. In his directive, Duffy said that if China or Russia were to reach the moon first, either country could "potentially declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit" the U.S.

Article: Shortly after Burroughs presided over a July hearing for Harvard's lawsuit over federal funding cuts, the president took to Truth Social and called her a "Trump-hating Judge," adding that she's "a TOTAL DISASTER." Who is this Massachusetts judge who's drawing so much ire from the White House? Her clerk said the judge didn't "think it would be possible or prudent, given the two Harvard cases that are still pending." The legal experts NPR reached out to were also cautious. "I have kept that voice mail — truly one of those calls you don't really ever expect and certainly don't forget." Gertner, who was on her selection committee, remembers Burroughs stood out because of her extensive time in the courtroom as both a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney. "Our system of justice is just amazing." Big cases have come through her courtroom Burroughs has witnessed her fair share of drama since joining the federal bench in the U.S. What she's like in the courtroom Court transcripts of pretrial conferences for cases involving Harvard show Burroughs is open about the fact that she wasn't accepted into Harvard's undergraduate program. Sponsor Message "I don't know if I should be starting to feel better or worse about the fact that I didn't get into Harvard," said Burroughs in a 2016 pretrial hearing after it was mentioned that Harvard judges applicants on 1,600 fields of information. In fact, she's often lighthearted in court, regularly starting proceedings with language like "all right, gang." During the July hearing for Harvard's federal funding case, Burroughs joked about the fact that several of Harvard's lawyers were present in court while, on the other side, there was just one attorney representing the federal government. "She can really cut to the chase, and she had the ability to take a lot of perspectives into account and distill them into our strategic plan going forward," said Chris Swistro, who used to work with Burroughs on the board of Womenade Boston. What's next for the pending Harvard cases The Trump administration has said it froze Harvard's federal research funding because the university allegedly violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to address antisemitism on campus. During the July hearing in that case, Burroughs called the federal government's arguments "mind-boggling." She asked the administration's attorney direct questions about what combating antisemitism on campus has to do with funds for cancer research. "You're not taking away grants from labs that could have been antisemitic, but just cut off funding in a way one could argue hurts Americans and Jews," she said in court. Department of Homeland Security regarding the international student ban case, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, "We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side." Trump has also said on Truth Social that he expects Burroughs to rule against the federal government but that "we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN." More recently, in late July, Trump said his administration was negotiating a possible settlement with Harvard.

According to the report, Langston, who’d lived with Mills in Florida, broke up with him when she learned that he was under investigation for allegedly assaulting another girlfriend he had in Washington, a pro-Trump activist named Sarah Raviani. When the cops arrived, according to The Washington Post, she had “what seemed to be visible injuries.” While Mills was not taken into custody that day, the police did eventually seek a warrant for his arrest. These two incidents are far from the only scandals involving Mills, who was elected in 2022 after boasting about founding a company that sold tear gas used on Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters. In May, however, the political news site NOTUS reported that five people who served with him — including two men whose lives he ostensibly saved — “say they have no recollection of Mills being at the incidents” that were listed on the form recommending him for the commendation.

Article: Starmer condemns Israel's plan to take over Gaza City 1 hour ago Share Save Becky Morton Political reporter Share Save PA Media Israel's plans to take over Gaza City are "wrong" and "will only bring more bloodshed", Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister urged the Israeli government to immediately reconsider its decision "to further escalate its offensive in Gaza", after Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet approved the plans overnight by a majority vote. Netanyahu had earlier said he wanted to take control of the whole of the Gaza strip but the approved plan focuses specifically on Gaza City, the largest city in the enclave. The move has also prompted warnings from the army leadership and family members of hostages held in Gaza, who fear the offensive would endanger the 20 captives believed to still be alive. Hamas can play no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well as disarm." He added: "Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both parties must step away from the path of destruction." Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the plans were "utterly abhorrent" and "it's increasingly clear [Netanyahu's] goal is ethnic cleansing". "This plan will only serve to wreak more devastation on the lives of millions of Gazans - whose homes and communities have already been destroyed - while endangering the lives of those hostages still held by Hamas," he said. "Keir Starmer needs to stop the export of all UK arms to Israel - today - and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet." It comes as Foreign Secretary David Lammy is due to meet US Vice President JD Vance at his official country residence of Chevening House, in Kent, later. Last week, the UK announced it would recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes "substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza", including agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution. The Israeli military currently controls about three-quarters of Gaza, and almost all of its 2.1 million citizens are situated in the quarter of the territory that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) do not control. The plan lists five objectives: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing "an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority".

Article: US shrugs off Gaza escalation - drifting further away from allies 1 hour ago Share Save Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent in Washington Share Save EPA President Donald Trump said this week it was "pretty much up to Israel" whether to occupy Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's declaration that Israel intends to take control of all of the Gaza Strip signals an escalation that flies in the face of some emphatic international warnings. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make." Netanyahu has faced some opposition to his plan - notably from the Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had argued against a full-scale occupation. In the event, an announcement after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet did not say Israel would take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, but rather that it would "prepare for taking control of Gaza City". "Netanyahu had always planned to take over Gaza, he just was waiting for the right moment," Amin Saikal, emeritus professor of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, told the BBC. Israel's security cabinet approves plan to take control of Gaza City Netanyahu divides Israelis and allies with plan to occupy Gaza Hundreds of Israeli ex-officials appeal to Trump to help end Gaza war In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory. And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict. "He bombs everything all the time." Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack. "We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire," Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a "lasting peace in Gaza". "I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad." Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table. "I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington." This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base. "There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on," Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. "But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants." If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions.

Article: Teen heartthrobs named Bobby were everywhere in the '60s — which was fine by me toggle caption Keystone/Getty Images; Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images; Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images; Hulton Archive/Getty Images; Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images; Alan Kent/Getty Images For quite a while now, I've been known as Bob. Darlene Love was using Phil Spector's famous "wall of sound" to let everyone know she was going to "Wait 'til My Bobby Gets Home." Lesley Gore was warning me about some other girl who was out to trap me in "Run Bobby Run." Sponsor Message And they were apparently all going to have to fight it out with the more formidable Etta James, who was soulfully wailing about her one true love in "Bobby Is His Name." A kid could get a complex, right? But there was another Bobby phenomenon back then: before some British guys named John, Paul, George and Ringo arrived on our shores, a cadre of American Bobbys had been topping the charts: Bobby Day did it with "Rockin' Robin" and its B-side "Over and Over" in 1958, and Bobby Darin with "Splish Splash" that same year. Bobby Vee had six top ten Billboard hits in the 1960s, including "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes," "Take Good Care of My Baby" and that one where he hiccupped that like a "Rubber Ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you-ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh." Bobby Vee was quickly one-upped (or maybe two-upped) by Bobby Vinton, who had eight top ten hits in the '60s including so many blue-themed songs – "Blue Velvet," "Blue on Blue" — that if you'd asked me who sang "the blues" back then, I might well have said him. There was also Bobby Rydell, who parlayed a bunch of top ten hits ("Volare," "Forget Him," "Wild One") into an acting gig as Ann-Margret's boyfriend Hugo in the movie musical Bye Bye Birdie (though he barely got to sing in it). And on the soul charts, Bobby Womack ("I'm Lookin' for a Love"), Bobby Lewis ("Tossin' and Turnin'") Bobby Freeman ("Do You Want to Dance"), and Bobby Smith of the Spinners. (Just for reference, these days it's barely in the top hundred.) So there was nothing exceptional about Greatest Generation parents like the Darins, Rydells, Vintons, Vees, Goldsboros, Womacks and Shermans calling their little soon-to-be-crooners that. Or maybe to that "Splish Splash" Bobby — Bobby Darin — who'd graduated to a more sophisticated sound, finding jazz and leaving teenybopper-dom behind with songs like "Mack the Knife." I was enough of a theater nut to know that that particular song was from an off-Broadway show called The Threepenny Opera. since I was a kid — they were my music now — and in 1970 I finally traveled to New York to catch my first musical on Broadway without my folks.

Article: The Queens shelter, called Ace’s Place, which officially opened this week, will be fully funded by the city at a cost of nearly $66 million over the next five years, according to Neha Sharma, a spokesperson for the city’s social services department. The shelter’s creation comes as the Trump administration and some state governments are attempting to roll back rights for transgender people, including curtailing access to gender-affirming health care, participation in high school sports and service in the military. “It’s a site that has been in the works for quite a while but it really is meaningful in this moment in time when the rights of the LGBT community as a whole, but particularly trans individuals, are under attack,” she said. “I feel like the city had our back,” said Coleman, who said that as an organizer of Bronx Pride he saw corporations pull back from sponsorships amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. So I was incredibly happy to learn that they were 100 percent behind making sure that we got the project up and running.” Advertisement Studies show that transgender people disproportionately experience homelessness. In 2020, researchers at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that eight percent of transgender adults reported indicators of recent homelessness — compared to one percent of straight cisgender adults. Jawanza Williams, the director of movement building at VOCAL-NY, a group that advocates for people impacted by homelessness, celebrated the new facility as a win for those who feel “unsafe in shelter systems that aren’t accounting for the unique needs and experiences of trans people.” Advertisement The shelter will provide a chance for trans people who are homeless to be surrounded by other people who share similar experiences, which can be “nurturing and important for people’s well-being,” said Stephen Russell, a researcher at Arizona State University who has studied homelessness among LGBTQ+ Americans. That feeling of safety, Russell said, can in turn provide the context for homeless transgender people “to make their way to stable housing.” Advertisement Advertisement Coleman said that his goal for Ace’s Place — named after his late mother, who struggled with drug addiction and to whom his grandmother would always open her home — is “economic empowerment.” Services at the shelter will include culinary classes, an on-site psychiatrist, job placement services and a housing specialist who will help those staying at the facility secure more permanent housing, Coleman said. “If you want to address homelessness, you have to have services that target the communities who are homeless,” said Christine Quinn, a former New York City council speaker and the CEO of Win, the largest provider of shelter and supportive housing for the city’s homeless families. Advertisement The shelter comes after the city agreed, as part of a lawsuit settlement in 2021, to reserve a minimum of 30 shelter beds for transgender and gender nonconforming clients across the city’s shelters. “Despite a presidential administration focused on taking America backwards and making homelessness worse, states can and must focus on real solutions to homelessness, like housing and support,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center, an advocacy group that has tracked a spike in what it calls “anti-homeless” local ordinances around the country in the past year.

Gaza reached that point after Israel escalated its prior siege of the territory to block virtually all aid from March to May, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages still in Gaza. When Israel allowed aid back in, it did so mostly under a contentious new aid delivery system that resulted in the killings of hundreds of Palestinians and kept all but the strongest and luckiest from getting food. Now Israel is pausing the fighting in some parts of Gaza each day to help aid convoys move, approving some imported food for sale in Gaza and allowing aid to be airdropped.

Article: That may not be to their benefit, experts say: For some borrowers, the new Standard Plan will keep them in debt longer and add tens of thousands of dollars to the total they must repay. "The design of the new plan, in which a borrower's payment term is scaled up in five-year increments based on arbitrary thresholds, means some borrowers will face a problematic 'cliff effect,'" said Michele Shepard Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute For College Access & Success. Historically, IDR plans cap a borrowers' monthly bill at a share of their discretionary income, and lead to loan cancellation after a certain period — typically 20 years or 25 years. Astra Taylor co-founder of the Debt Collective Longer repayment times add to borrowers' cost Under the new Standard Plan, some borrowers with higher balances may have lower monthly bills than under the current plan because their repayment term is longer, said Zampini. (He assumed a 5% interest rate.) But under the revised plan, that same borrower would be required to pay back more than $175,000 during their 25-year term — a difference of nearly $50,000. That plan will be one of just two repayment options available to borrowers who take out student loans after that date, along with Republicans' new IDR plan, called the Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP.

The plan - or the "five principles for ending the war" includes: The disarmament of Hamas The return of all hostages, both living and dead The demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip The establishment of an alternative civilian administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority. Israel has not said when the takeover will begin but reports in Israeli media suggest the military will not move into Gaza City immediately - and residents will need to be evacuated first. Netanyahu is being "intentionally vague" over who the Arab forces he names may be, according to the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, as he has been in the past with his plans for Gaza. He may be referring to the Jordanians and the Egyptians, who have said they are willing to work with Israel - but they have made it clear that they will not go into Gaza on the back of an Israeli occupation.

"By choosing military escalation over negotiation, we are leaving our loved ones at the mercy of Hamas," the group said in a statement. The Israeli prime minister's announcement of plans to take control of Gaza City has been met with concern in Israel, particularly by families of hostages still being held by Hamas. Anat Angrest, the mother of hostage Matan Angrest, said at the time: "For a year and 10 months we've been trying to believe that everything is being done to bring them back - you have failed." The group's collective statement, published on Friday following the announcement, accused the government of "leading us toward a colossal catastrophe". More widely within the country Tal Schneider, political correspondent at the Times of Israel, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday there had been a "huge public backlash" in Israel against the plans. I think we should do something about [...] Hamas anyway, but not at this time." Israeli resident Talya Saltzman also told Reuters bringing the hostages home should be "first and foremost". "It just doesn't seem that there's any real forward movement with this plan and unless we can get rid of all of Hamas in one go [I] just think that the hostages need to be top priority and then we need to stop all of our soldiers from dying."

Article: "We mean the intentional, systematic destruction of not only health care infrastructure, hospitals, health care workers, medical supply lines," says co-author Joelle Abi-Rached , a professor of medicine at the American University of Beirut, "but also the devastation of a population's health and its well-being in its entirety. In other words, healthocide refers to a shattering of the very wholeness that health itself implies." By creating this new term, Abi-Rached seeks to convey the urgent need to address what she says are flagrant violations of international law. toggle caption Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images toggle caption Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images Such assaults are not new, but they were once "viewed as collateral damage or accidental, something that was cause for condemnation and immediate apologies or denials by the fighting forces," says Sam Zarifi, the executive director of Physicians for Human Rights . "And that is new and it's very, very worrisome." That worry is due in part to the amplification of injury and death when hospitals and clinics are damaged or destroyed and medical professionals are harmed or killed. It's "used to sow fear, cripple care and magnify the human toll." Sponsor Message A troubled region The birth of this word is tied to what has unfolded in Abi-Rached's home country of Lebanon. The following month, in mid-September 2024, the increasingly violent tit-for-tat conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that had been brewing since Hamas' deadly October 7 attack on Israel morphed into a full blown war. "The number of attacks in such a very short period in Lebanon is unique," says Len Rubenstein , the chair of the SHCC and director emeritus of the Program on Human Rights, Health and Conflict at Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization has tabulated that in the 22 months since October 7, roughly half of all global attacks on health care have occurred within the Palestinian territories, which include Gaza. The global targeting of hospitals and medical workers, especially in Gaza and Lebanon, helped motivate Abi-Rached and her colleagues to write their commentary that proposes the adoption of the word healthocide. "Those states who previously supported the norm [prohibiting attacks on health care], at least rhetorically, seemed reluctant to defend the norm in the context of Israel and Palestine (and to some extent Lebanon)," he says. "And I think if there is accountability there, that's really, really important." Sponsor Message "I was very pleased" Amal Elamin , a global health expert at the University of Greenwich who's written about the collapse of the health care system in Sudan due to civil war, welcomes the new word. "It reinforces the fact that the targeted attacks on health care settings and health workers is no longer an isolated precedent." Elamin says that the details of the atrocities vary from place to place but the willful intentionality is consistent, including in Sudan, where her parents grew up and where she has spent portions of her life. So it's a deliberate destruction that is intended to dismantle the system — that we are not going to leave any place untouched." In addition, Elamin has observed that, similar to Gaza, the international community has failed to speak out uniformly and forcefully against assaults on health care in Sudan. And the health workers are still expected to perform and provide within these challenging situations." In her view, this is why health workers in conflict zones can feel overlooked and neglected.

Article: As Texas Republicans try to muscle a rare mid-decade redistricting bill through the Legislature to help Republicans gain seats in Congress -- at President Donald Trump's request -- residents in Austin, the state capital, could find themselves sharing a district with rural Texans more than 300 miles away. Texas 2021 Congressional map in Austin area, congressional district 37 Google Earth, Princeton Gerrymandering Project Rural congressional districts, where people often live further apart, tend to be larger because districts are intended to have roughly the same number of residents so one American’s vote is not more diluted than another’s. Texas 2025 Congressional map draft, congressional district 11 and 37 Google Earth, Princeton Gerrymandering Project That would mean people in that area would share a congressman with people who live more than 311 miles away, a distance that is about 15 times more than that between them and those who currently live the farthest away. "If you look at many of these districts, whether they're here or elsewhere in the nation, you do not necessarily see a community of interest," Sherri Greenberg, the assistant dean for the LBJ School of Public Affairs at UT Austin told ABC News. You see perhaps along skinny districts, or districts that look like a piece of pie where you are not keeping communities together or interests together." Greenberg, asked what the new map means for the 37th district, said, "you're spreading thin across many, many miles, with different cities, counties, communities, different interests, different topography, geography, culture, potentially." Greenberg served in the Texas House as a Democrat in the 1990s. Last month, President Trump said he was looking for "a very simple redrawing; we pick up five seats." David Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, told ABC News that the proposed map could lead Democrats on a "collision course," finding themselves competing for the remaining Democratic-leaning district in their area. Democrats have slammed the draft map as being "rigged," a "power grab," and "racist" and Texas House legislators have fled the state to preclude Republicans of the quorum needed to pass it. "We won't let that happen, because if they're able to suppress the votes of Austinites under Trump's plan, soon enough, they'll try to suppress the votes of all Americans." Wasserman said he estimates the proposed map would help Republicans pick up three to five additional seats in Texas by spreading out minority voters. "It dilutes or eliminates districts where minority voters have elected Democrats in recent years." But Greenberg and Wasserman said Democrats may face an uphill battle in court because of voting trends that show Latinos shifting toward conservatives, making it harder to argue that drawing them out of Democratic districts prevent them from voting for who they want. "Republicans will make the case in court that Hispanic voters no longer constitute a cohesive political group because they've migrated so much towards Donald Trump, and that could really weaken Democrats' argument in court that those performing districts deserve protection," Wasserman said. Several of the protesting Texas state lawmakers' Democratic allies in blue states have vowed to pursue redrawing congressional lines in their own states, including California, to shore up Democrats' numbers and counter what is happening in Texas.

Article: Analysts who spoke to ABC News attributed investor optimism to robust corporate profits, the prospect of interest rate cuts at the Federal Reserve and an abiding expectation that Trump will not return to the steep tariffs initially rolled out in April. "The mindset of the market is to embrace risk because that brings rewards rather than losses -- keep shrugging it off," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Brokers, told ABC News. "That can paper over a lot of concerns." The economy added an average of about 35,000 jobs over three months ending in July, which marks a major slowdown from roughly 128,000 jobs added monthly over the prior three months, U.S. Hours after the release of the jobs report on Friday, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who was confirmed by a bipartisan vote in the Senate in 2024. In a social media post, Trump volleyed sharp criticism and baseless accusations at McEntarfer, claiming without evidence that the data had been "manipulated." The jobs report featured revisions of previous months' data, which is a routine practice. "Trump touted his economic performance in a social media post: "The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP' despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates." McEntarfer did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for comment. "It has been the honor of my life to serve as Commissioner of BLS alongside the many dedicated civil servants tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy," McEntarfer said in a social media post after her dismissal. "They've been pretty impressive considering some of the economic data has looked soft of late." The outlook for the economy remains uncertain, leaving open the possibility of continued growth and soaring stocks, some analysts said.

In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours and that 14 children, including toddlers, were held for over 20 days in April. The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees' constitutional rights are being violated.

Russia was amassing troops on the border with Ukraine, where large swaths of land in the east had long been occupied by Moscow-backed forces; Washington repeatedly accused Russia of cyberattacks. Putin met Trump met six times during the American's first term -– at and on the sidelines of G20 and APEC gatherings — but most famously in Helsinki in July 2018. They hosted each other for talks and informal meetings in Russia and the U.S., met regularly on the sidelines of international summits and forums, and boasted of improving ties between onetime rivals. After the first meeting with Putin in 2001, Bush said he “looked the man in the eye” and “found him very straightforward and trustworthy,” getting “a sense of his soul.” In 2002, they signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty -– a nuclear arms pact that significantly reduced both countries’ strategic nuclear warhead arsenal. He has called Bush “a decent person and a good friend,” adding that good relations with him helped find a way out of “the most acute and conflict situations.” —— Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau contributed.

Article: colleges College endowment tax is leading to hiring freezes and could mean cuts in financial aid A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes. The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.” The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.” For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.

His optimism on shares also comes from Peloton's work on its cost base and capital structure, as well as its greater use cases and go-to market strategies of its fitness products.

Article: SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 27: Robots of Unitree Robotics show their kick boxing skills during the 2025 World AI Conference (WAIC) and High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance at Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center on July 27, 2025 in Shanghai, China. Framed as a bid to prevent monopolies and foster inclusivity, the move was also a clear shot across Washington's bow: a declaration that China intends not just to compete in AI, but to define its rules and global architecture. What is becoming clear is that the race for global AI leadership will be won not only by those who develop the most powerful models, but by those who can deploy them when and where they matter most. China's practical, application-first approach — deploying open-source AI to improve agriculture, logistics, education, public health, and other public services — makes its model especially attractive to countries seeking early, visible gains. Its export of utility and digital infrastructure — including power grids and smart city platforms in bundles like Huawei's compact "AI-in-a-box" systems — is enabling even low-resource nations such as Kenya, Thailand, and Egypt to scale AI applications without the need for expensive hyperscale data centers. In doing so, it is turning AI access into a powerful instrument of soft power, one that fuses technological exports with influence over digital norms, governance preferences, and strategic alignment.

Article: A person falsely claiming to be part of the band spoke to media outlets, including Rolling Stone, about the AI usage — and then admitted to lying about the whole thing in an attempt to troll journalists. "An ongoing artistic provocation designed to challenge the boundaries of authorship, identity, and the future of music itself in the age of AI." Like every other technological advancement that has preceded it, artificial intelligence has caused some panic — and fascination — over how it might transform the music industry. Its practical uses run the gamut from helping human artists restore audio quality (like the surviving members of The Beatles did with John Lennon's old vocal demos on the Grammy-winning track "Now and Then") to full-blown deception à la The Velvet Sundown. In podcasts and interviews, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has spoken about his optimism that AI will allow Spotify's algorithm to better match listeners with what they're looking for, ideally delivering "that magical thing that you didn't even know that you liked — better than you can do yourself," as he told The New York Post in May. In response to questions about whether Spotify has considered implementing a detection or labeling system for music created with AI — as well as what challenges might arise from doing that — a Spotify spokesperson did not confirm or deny the possibility. Content that misleads listeners, infringes on artists' rights, or abuses the platform will be penalized or taken down." Generative AI and ghost artists In 2023, Spotify and other platforms removed a song that used AI to clone the voices of Drake and The Weeknd without the artists' permission after Universal Music Group invoked copyright violations. But if one of its songs came up on a user's Discover Weekly — Spotify's automated playlists that rack up millions of streams every week — there would also be no warning that the voice they're listening to doesn't belong to a real person. Liz Pelly, a journalist and the author of Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist, says that transparency has been a major problem on streaming services for nearly a decade — and that users should get a clearer understanding of what they're consuming and where it's coming from. "In order for users of these services to make informed decisions and in order to encourage a greater sense of media literacy on streaming, I do think that it's really important that services are doing everything they can to accurately label this material," Pelly says. " Sponsor Message Ek, Spotify's CEO, has commended AI for simplifying music production and lowering the barrier of entry into creation — but AI-generated music could also reduce licensing fees and overall payout costs for streaming services. In response to questions about this practice and the financial implications, a Spotify spokesperson told NPR: "Spotify prioritizes listener satisfaction, and there is a demand for music to suit certain occasions or activities, including mood or background music. Spotify doesn't dictate how artists present their work, including whether they publish their songs with real names, under a band name, or a pseudonym." One platform is already doing it In June, Deezer rolled out the first AI detection and tagging system to be used by a major music-streaming company. "Or if there were also some kind of generational effect — like are young people going to switch to this kind of music?" Sponsor Message So far, he says, that hasn't been the case. We have a huge increase in the amount of tracks that are AI-generated, and there is no increase in real people streaming this content." Instead, he says, AI-generated content like The Velvet Sundown sees a spike in listenership when there's media attention, but it quickly subsides when listeners move on from the novelty. There are many instances in which artists can use artificial intelligence to boost or enhance their work — but both in and out of the music industry, transparency is key to AI usage. What the government has said is we are going to label food to tell you how healthy and unhealthy it is, how much sugar, how much sodium, how much fat," Farid says. We're simply informing you." Sponsor Message Sticking with the grocery analogy, Farid says the responsibility for those labels doesn't fall on the store — it falls on whoever is manufacturing the products. There's responsibility up and down the staff here." AI-generated models move at such a fast pace, Farid says, it's difficult to give people guidance on how to identify deepfakes or other AI-generated content. "If music listeners are concerned with not accidentally finding themselves in a situation where they are listening to or supporting generative AI music, I would say the most direct thing to do is go straight to the source," Pelly says, "whether that be buying music directly from independent artists and independent record labels, getting recommendations not through these anonymous algorithmic news feeds, and investing in the networks of music culture that exist outside of the centers of power and the tech industry."

Article: Miran may be filling only a temporary opening on the Federal Reserve’s powerful board of governors, but in that role he can influence important discussions in and around the central bank, which President Trump has repeatedly attacked as an obstacle to his economic agenda. Officials at the Fed are deliberating when and by how much to lower interest rates after a long pause, and there is a tight contest underway for who will be named the next chair of the institution. That position was formerly held by Adriana Kugler, who officially stepped down on Friday after abruptly announcing last week that she would leave the post early and return to academia. Trump wants the Fed to cut interest rates significantly, but the central bank has opted to keep them steady this year, anticipating that the Trump administration’s tariff and other economic policies would unleash higher inflation even as growth slows.

The family said it was Lungu's final wish that Hichilema should not get anywhere near his burial, but the Zambian government went to court to stop him being buried in South Africa. “Such that even if a president has expressed a desire not to be given a state funeral, such a wish must be overridden by public interest,” said Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba. Zambia's Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha welcomed the judgment, telling reporters that he hoped the ruling would bring the matter to a close even though the family still had a right to appeal. It's just what makes good sense, that the former president of the Republic of Zambia should be buried in his own country, the country where he was president,” said Kabesha.

"And the government … they're really going to take the lead when it comes to AI on the sovereign front, and that's why they're one of our top names, and again, I think a trillion-dollar [market cap] in the next two, three years." Palantir currently has a market cap of around $432 billion, according to LSEG data. In a note on Tuesday, Ives raised his price target for Palantir from $160 to $200, citing "continued hyper growth demand for the company's AI product suite." If the stock achieves Wedbush's new target price, it would mark a 9.8% premium on Thursday's closing price. "Many investors, they've hated [Palantir shares] at $20, despised it at $50, [been] screaming from the mountaintops at $100, $150, [but] they're revolutionizing tech." — CNBC's Alex Harring contributed to this article.

Article: President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine expires on Friday, as markets watch whether the White House will proceed with steep penalties on Moscow's oil clients. Increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin, Trump has pledged "secondary tariffs" of "about 100%" on Russia's trade partners, if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, setting an initial 50-day timeline that was later shortened. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a key foreign policy objective of his second presidential mandate, reversing course on an initial thawing of White House relations with Moscow to now pile on pressure on the Kremlin for the lull in diplomatic progress. At the heart of Russia and Ukraine's inability to strike a ceasefire to date have been differences over Putin's maximalist demands that the war can only end if Kyiv gives up its ambitions to join the NATO military alliance and if Moscow retains four Ukrainian regions annexed during the latest conflict. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travelled for an eleventh-hour meeting with Putin, which Trump hailed as "highly productive." "Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come," he said Wednesday. Very disappointed." At risk for Russia is the potential dissolution of its scant remaining client base for its crude and oil products volumes, which countries within the G7 are no longer permitted to take on a seaborne basis. Under a G7 scheme, nations outside of the coalition retain critical access to Western shipping and insurance mechanisms as long as they only purchase Russian supplies under a price cap. Russia's sanctions-sapped economy heavily depends on its crude sales, amid increasing isolation on the international stage and dwindling growth expected near 1.4% this year, from 4.3% in 2024, according to the World Bank's June forecasts.

Article: Snapchat row and a hidden knife: The final hours before Harvey Willgoose's murder 41 minutes ago Share Save Chloe Aslett BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save Family handout Harvey Willgoose "loved his friends like he loved his family", his mum said When Harvey Willgoose left for school on 3 February, neither he, nor those who knew and loved him, had any idea he would not return home again. Two days later, on the Friday before he was killed, Harvey had messaged his dad: "Am not going in that school while people have knives." The following week, he summoned the courage to return - and was fatally stabbed in the chest by another pupil. During a month-long trial at Sheffield Crown Court, his killer admitted manslaughter, but denied murder, arguing he had suffered a "loss of control" - saying his memory of what happened stopped "just before I stabbed him". Mark and Caroline Willgoose, Harvey's parents, attended court throughout the trial On Monday 3 February, as pupils across Sheffield prepared for a normal school day, Harvey's killer searched online for a prayer to keep him safe and tucked a hunting knife into his coat pocket. He described it as a "scary knife" which he only kept for protection: "If someone tried to attack me and I pulled it out, they're not going to want to fight me," he later told the jury. Harvey and the defendant were in separate social groups at school, but were generally on good terms - at least until a "non-stop" argument had erupted on Snapchat the weekend after the fight between their friends. He tagged the defendant's friend, and said: "If you've got a problem with [my friends] - any of them - you've got my addy [address], I'll deal with it, simple." Handout Harvey had expressed concern about knives at school before his death Before school on Monday, Harvey opened Snapchat again to try and clear the air. PA Media Flowers were laid outside All Saints Catholic High School after Harvey was killed Soon after, Harvey ran into teacher Claire Staniforth, who was head of Year 10 at the time. Harvey, in a mock show of toughness held his hands up and added: "As if anyone's going to stab me." At about 10:55, in morning break, he and the defendant met in the same corridor as before. The defendant did not mention this skirmish to Ms Staniforth when, 15 minutes later, he went to her office to ask to be excused from his science lesson in order to avoid two other students. He had already been allowed to miss PE earlier - to avoid the boy he claimed had brought the knife the week before - so was told to attend science as normal. "My arm was in a sling at the time [and] he was joking, saying I had been in a fight." But when the defendant walked in, Harvey asked for a time-out. PA Media Floral tributes to football fan Harvey were laid at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane stadium At 12:05, five minutes before lunch, Harvey spoke to Ms Staniforth again via the phone in the isolation room. "I told him, 'give it to me before you do something stupid', but he didn't listen." Emergency services were called to the school just after 12:15 GMT on 3 February At 12:15, in the school courtyard, Harvey was said to have met the defendant for the final time. "I said, 'just give me the knife'." Mr Davis told the court the defendant looked scared and in shock: "He just kept repeating, 'you know I can't control it'." He did not resist the teacher as he took the knife from him, the court heard. Mrs Willgoose told the BBC how on the way there, a voice on the officer's walkie talkie said: "Turn the blue lights off, go at normal speed." "We got there, and someone had put 'RIP Harvey' [online]," she said. One teenager, who had known Harvey since they were six, said he thought about him on a daily basis: "Every time I needed somewhere to go or someone to see, even at half three in morning, he would always be there no matter what." "He weren't a friend, he was more family," he added.

Article: "We're implementing this about as well as this thing can be implemented, and it is still going to be pretty catastrophic." The new tax-and-spending law signed by President Trump in July will mandate a vast expansion of Medicaid work requirements to most states. toggle caption Michigan Office of the Governor via AP/Michigan Governors Office Republicans say this is a common-sense way to weed out "freeloaders." Democrats argue that's just political cover for slashing a program that saved some 27,000 lives between 2010 (when the Affordable Care Act passed) and 2022. Sponsor Message The number of people who lose coverage, either temporarily or permanently, could vary fairly widely by state, depending on how each state implements and maintains their reporting systems. "We were very committed to implementing a law that we didn't agree with, in a way that reduced the number of people who lost insurance, just because the government screwed something up," Gordon said. To Snyder, it was an opportunity to simultaneously save money and expand access: by slashing the rate of uninsured Michiganders almost in half, the state could reduce the burden of uncompensated care on the health system, and boost the economy by improving the physical health of the workforce. By 2019, there were nearly 700,000 new Medicaid recipients in Michigan, and the state was responsible for an increasing share of their health care costs (Medicaid is paid for jointly by states and the federal government.) Fiscal hawks were worried. "It's now become the largest budget problem in Michigan," said Jarrett Skorup of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank Snyder signed the bill creating the 80-hour a month work requirements in 2018, but it wouldn't go into effect until 2020, after he left office. "Maybe they got sicker, maybe they died because of this decision." If Michiganders lost coverage at the same rate as Arkansans, as many as 180,000 people would lose their health insurance within a year, according to one estimate. "You're just exempted." toggle caption David Eggert/AP Michigan eventually changed the law to allow people more time to report their work activities, and to automatically determine their compliance by cross-checking data from other assistance programs, like food assistance benefits. Yet at the state health department, "all of the oxygen in the room was dedicated - almost all, I should say - to the work requirement implementation," said Renuka Tipirneni, MD, MSc, who studies Michigan's Medicaid expansion at the University of Michigan. Because that's just what happens with systems like this." A 'waste' of $30 million By the time the work requirements went into effect on January 1, 2020, the state had been able to determine that the vast majority of the nearly 700,000 Medicaid expansion recipients already met the work requirements, or were exempt. Sponsor Message Instead, he found himself explaining to legislators that the state's work requirements were essentially dead in the water, and that "we had, on the demand of the people holding the hearing, spent tens of millions of dollars for no purpose." Given how brief Michigan's experiment with Medicaid work requirements actually was — only about three months of the policy being in effect, and no one actually losing coverage in the end — the Mackinac Center's Skorup doesn't think there are a lot of takeaways here about the real-life impacts of work requirements. "If you have an administration that is not sold on these being necessary at all, then they're more likely to drag their feet on implementing this, which is what I think [the Whitmer administration] did," Skorup said. In regards to the state budget, Skorup believes that "at this point, it's crowding out teacher pay, it's crowding out pensions, it's crowding out roads." Supporters of Medicaid expansion say the program's growth has actually benefited Michigan, pointing to research that Medicaid expansion actually helped boost employment and school enrollment, and was a net positive for the state financially. Court ruling came down just days before state's first COVID cases Just days after the court ruling stopped work requirements in Michigan, officials announced the state's first cases of COVID-19 . These days, Gordon is experiencing a sense of deja vu, with new predictions showing as many as 500,000 Michiganders could lose coverage within the first year of mandated work requirements, according to state estimates.

Article: President Donald Trump’s Friday deadline for the Kremlin to make peace arrived and he eyed a possible summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment Thursday that “Putin remains uninterested in ending his war and is attempting to extract bilateral concessions from the United States without meaningfully engaging in a peace process.” “Putin continues to believe that time is on Russia’s side and that Russia can outlast Ukraine and the West,” it said. Orbán said the leaders of Germany and France should go to Moscow “to negotiate on behalf of Europe.” Otherwise, “we will be sidelined in managing the security issues of our own continent,” Orbán told Hungary’s state broadcaster. Orbán, who is a harsh critic of the European Union to which his country belongs, said Europe’s concerns that a Trump-Putin summit might not address the continent’s interests meant it should seize the diplomatic initiative.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said Friday it plans to take over Gaza City — in what would be an escalation of its 22-month war with Hamas that drew a dismissal from the militant group, renewed international calls to end the conflict, and stirred fears for hostages still held in Gaza. Meanwhile, mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told the Associated Press. READ MORE: Netanyahu to seek approval for expanded Gaza offensive as 37 Palestinians are killed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier outlined more sweeping plans in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. Netanyahu had signaled plans for even broader war An expanded offensive could widen discord between Israel and international powers, which have stepped up criticism of the war amid mounting shock over media reports showing starvation. “The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. WATCH: Mideast experts analyze consequences as Israel considers full Gaza occupation Tensions could rise further if Netanyahu follows through on the more sweeping plans to take control of the entire territory, two decades after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the strip. Asked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza,” Netanyahu replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.” He added that Israel did not intend to “keep it.” Israel’s current plan, announced after the Security Cabinet met through Thursday night, stopped short of that, and may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel’s terms.

Officials at the Fed are deliberating when and by how much to lower interest rates after a long pause, and there is a tight contest underway for who will be named the next chair of the institution. That position was formerly held by Adriana Kugler, who officially stepped down on Friday after abruptly announcing last week that she would leave the post early and return to academia. Trump wants the Fed to cut interest rates significantly, but the central bank has opted to keep them steady this year, anticipating that the Trump administration’s tariff and other economic policies would unleash higher inflation even as growth slows.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) WASHINGTON -- An advocacy group sued the Justice Department and the FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled. “The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials. Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation.

(AP Photo/Louise Delmotte) HIROSHIMA, Japan -- When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Ari Beser’s grandfather was on board both of the American B-29 bombers that carried the weapons. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers’ linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States. During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences. When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: “I wouldn’t say it was our proudest moment.” He said the world needed to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Beser, who was in the back of the aircraft working as a radar specialist, said that all he saw out of the window was a “boiling muddy mess with fires continuing to break out on the periphery.” Three days later, he was in another bomber, Bockscar, above Yamaguchi's hometown. “For me, all I focus on is trying to convey it to people so that it doesn’t happen again." Because his grandfather was on both B-29s, Ari Beser was always interested in meeting a double survivor. Everybody needs hope and this is how I get hope." ___ This story has been corrected to show that the the spelling of the second bomber is Bockscar, not Bochscar.

Article: The end of Tesla 's own AI supercomputer efforts — where it was developing its own chips — means Elon Musk's company will become an even bigger customer for major chipmakers, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Aaron Rakers highlighted Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices as beneficiaries of Tesla's decision to shut down its custom-built AI training supercomputer Dojo team, which was first reported by Bloomberg on Thursday. "This should be viewed as a positive for NVIDIA and AMD as this likely increases Tesla usage of general purpose GPUs for AI." Rakers highlighted that Tesla has been notably expanding its graphics processing units (GPU) infrastructure. Musk said in early 2024 that while a Dojo supercomputer would cost $500 million to build, "Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year." Nvidia GPUs were being used for Tesla's other efforts beyond Dojo, such as training and inference of its Grok AI chatbot. The analyst acknowledged that the Bloomberg report is markedly different from Musk's comments during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, during which he said that the Dojo 2 supercomputer is expected to operate at scale next year and that the Dojo 3 and the Ai6 inference chip would find convergence, meaning they would integrate in some way and be the same chip. The Dojo supercomputer was designed to train AI models on data captured by Tesla vehicles, and has been part of Musk's heavy emphasis to investors over the last year that Tesla is an artificial intelligence and robotics company, not just an electric vehicle company.

Article: A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity. But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges — until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations. Will you marry me?” Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva — whom he met in 2021 — that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity. Any small stimulus — a smell, a breeze, a color — can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv. "It just feels less intense.” A 2014 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Israeli ex-POWs and combat veterans tracked over 35 years had higher mortality rates, chronic illnesses and worse self-rated health — conditions partly tied to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

"Actually, we have very good relations, and I think both the Bank and the Treasury have made that clear." Bailey added that while he couldn't comment too much on Revolut specifically, the Prudential Regulation Authority is working things through with the digital banking startup during its "mobilization" process.

Article: Israel's Gaza City plan means more misery for Palestinians and big risk for Netanyahu About one million people still live in Gaza City, which has already seen widespread damage due to Israeli bombardment News of the Israeli government's decision to take over Gaza City is being met not surprisingly with despair in Gaza. Assuming that Hamas does not capitulate in the coming weeks – and there are currently few signs of this happening – then the Israeli military is set to embark on a devastating new phase of the war. Hundreds of thousands are people who were forced to flee during the early months of the war but who returned in January when a ceasefire raised hopes of an end to the fighting. But life in the city, hard enough already, deteriorated rapidly after Israel broke the ceasefire in mid-March and cut off aid supplies, triggering the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict.

Article: My baby's death must not be in vain, says mum left to give birth alone and in a coma 7 hours ago Share Save Nelli Bird BBC Share Save 'Her death has to be for something... it just can't happen again' A mum whose daughter died at 20 hours old after she was left alone during labour says the harrowing experience is "seared into" her mind. Liliwen Iris Thomas died on 10 October 2022 at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales due to a lack of oxygen when Emily Brazier gave birth alone and in a coma after a reaction to pain medication. She added: "For the coroner to say that this should not have happened and that she should be here is something we needed to hear." The harrowing details of Liliwen's birth are "seared into" Emily's mind - she was alone in the induction suite of the maternity unit, where women stay during the early stages of labour. "I was just puffing on gas and air, I couldn't move, I couldn't press a call bell, I couldn't open my eyes, it was as if I was trapped in my own body." Emily had been given significant amounts of pethidine and codeine with no-one monitoring her use of gas and air. "I just thought 'someone will come and help me - surely, someone will help me.' But nobody did." Emily's partner Rhodri Thomas, 41, was not with her because of Cardiff and Vale health board's policy at the time did not allow partners on the ward overnight, unless their partner was in active labour. Hospital records show nobody checked on Emily for an hour during which time she gave birth to Liliwen as she drifted in and out of a coma and she woke up to see "so much blood and a baby lying there". Emily said, when Rhodri arrived, no-one told him of the seriousness of the situation and the first thing she said to him was: "I don't know if our baby is alive." The following hours were filled with visits from family members who "said hello and goodbye" to Liliwen after it became clear she would not survive. Emily Brazier Rhodri Thomas and Emily Brazier had just 20 hours with their daughter Liliwen before she died The health board said it sent its "deepest sympathies" to the family and was "fully committed to learning from this tragic event". It added: "In response to the concerns raised, we have implemented robust changes to staffing, escalation protocols and psychological support for both families and staff." A spokesperson added the board would "welcome the opportunity to meet with Liliwen's family to share the actions taken". Liliwen's inquest heard fundamental changes had been made at the health board since 2022, including only allowing women to use gas and air under supervision, reducing doses of other painkillers and reassessing their induction processes. "If they can implement the changes that Cardiff and Vale have, it's a step closer to this not happening again." Emily Brazier says she will never fully move on from her daughter's death The family are also concerned that Liliwen's death was investigated by an officer within the health board. Another avenue for change could be through a review of NICE guidance on pain relief in labour - something raised by Coroner Rachel Knight in a Prevention of Future Death report following Liliwen's inquest. "Then I can say I have done everything in her name and to think that this will not happen to another family is a sense of justice for us as well." Emily Brazier Emily says having her son, Ellis, now eight months, has been "healing" for her and Rhodri, who already had daughter Carys, five, but they always feel Liliwen is missing from their lives The Welsh government said patient safety was "paramount" and it was aware of the findings at Cardiff and Vale health board. It added: "An independent assessment of all Welsh maternity and neonatal services began in July to assess how all maternity services are performing against national guidelines." The family's lawyers, Slater and Gordon are still negotiating a claim against the health board and senior associate Lara Bennett called Liliwen's death "absolutely tragic and... She added that it was "vital" that all health boards in Wales adopted the new policies to ensure the mistakes that led to Liliwen's death are not allowed to happen again.

Article: BERLIN (AP) — Germany will not authorize any exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza “until further notice,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced Friday, in a strikingly quick response by one of Israel’s strongest international backers to a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet to take over Gaza City. The move by Germany, which has previously stopped short of tougher lines against Israel’s government taken by some of its European Union allies, appeared likely to further isolate Israel in the wake of the military takeover plan that has been decried by the United Nations, aid and human rights groups, and supporters of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, among others. READ MORE: Israel plans to take over Gaza City, escalating war with Hamas and fueling worries for hostages In a statement, Merz emphasized that Israel “has the right to defend itself against Hamas’ terror” and said that the release of Israeli hostages and purposeful negotiations toward a ceasefire in the 22-month conflict “are our top priority.” He said Hamas must not have a role in the future of Gaza. “The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,” he added. “Under these circumstances, the German government will not authorize any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice.” It was not immediately clear which military equipment from Germany would be affected. The weight of responsibility The German government remains deeply concerned about the suffering of civilians in Gaza, Merz said, adding: “With the planned offensive, the Israeli government bears even greater responsibility than before for providing for their needs.” He called on Israel to allow comprehensive access for aid deliveries — including for U.N. organizations and other NGOs — and said Israel “must continue to comprehensively and sustainably address the humanitarian situation in Gaza.” The move has particular weight because Germany has been seen as one of Israel’s strongest supporters — arguably surpassed only by the United States. WATCH: Mideast experts analyze consequences as Israel considers full Gaza occupation Merz’s government did not join announcements by President Emmanuel Macron of key German ally France and Britain’s Keir Starmer that they plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September. Merz also called on Israel’s government “not to take any further steps toward annexing the West Bank.” Other European countries express their concerns Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on X that Netanyahu’s plan to intensify operations in Gaza “is a wrong move.” He added that “the humanitarian situation is catastrophic and demands immediate improvement. This decision in no way contributes to this and will also not help to get the hostages home.” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen was quoted by public broadcaster DR as saying: “The Israeli government’s decision to intensify the military operation in Gaza is wrong. It will only lead to even greater suffering for the civilian population.” Last week, even before the Gaza City takeover plane, Slovenia announced it will ban the import, export and transit of all weapons to and from Israel in response to the country’s actions in Gaza — saying it was the first EU member country to do so. READ MORE: Egypt’s foreign minister says the West’s response to Gaza suffering is shameful Last month, two dozen mostly European countries condemned Israel’s restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza and the killings of hundreds of Palestinians trying to reach food. The Israeli decision, taken after a late-night meeting of top officials, came despite mounting international calls to end the war and protests by many in Israel who fear for the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The timing of another major Israeli ground operation remains unclear since it will likely hinge on mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians, almost certainly exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will convene a peace summit at the White House on Friday with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan that is meant to end decades of conflict and reopen key transportation routes in the region. The two countries in the South Caucasus region will sign an agreement that will create a major transit corridor that will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said. “The roadmap they are agreeing to will build a cooperative future that benefits both countries, their region of the South Caucasus and beyond," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Friday. She added that the new transit corridor will “allow unimpeded connectivity between the two countries while respecting Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and its people." Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan are separated by a 32-kilometer (20-mile) patch of Armenia’s territory. Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan will sign deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said. Trump previewed much of Friday’s plan in a social media post Thursday evening, saying the two leaders would participate in a peace ceremony and sign economic agreements with the U.S. that would “fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.” “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,’” Trump said on his Truth Social site. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of the Karabakh region in a blitz offensive in September 2023, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward.

Article: The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months The entrance to a Boar's Head deli meat plant is seen in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar’s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. “The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,” officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday. And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar’s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. “If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize" for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.” But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. “You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. Rosa DeLauro called the findings “appalling.” “This is a pattern of negligence — cutting corners to protect the company’s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including “5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.” Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.

Article: Sweetgreen shares dropped more than 25% on Friday after the salad chain cut its 2025 outlook for the second quarter in a row, citing issues with its loyalty program, weak consumer sentiment, tariff headwinds and store challenges. For the full-year 2025, Sweetgreen now expects revenue of between $700 million and $715 million, down from its May prediction of $740 million to $760 million and its February outlook of $760 million to $780 million. On a Thursday call with analysts, CEO Jonathan Neman said Sweetgreen had a "really, really rough quarter." He said both external headwinds and internal actions played a role in the performance, including "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April, lapping a tough comparison with last year's successful steak launch and the transition of our new loyalty program at the beginning of the quarter." The company reported a second-quarter earnings and revenue miss, reporting a loss of 20 cents per share versus a 12-cent loss expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG. Neman told investors on Thursday that only one-third of restaurants are performing at or above standards, while the remaining two-thirds "represent a meaningful opportunity for improvement." He said the company is aiming to improve operations through the leadership of its new COO, Jason Cochran, and the launch of a new program called Project One Best Way, focused on improving speed and food standards and increasing portion sizes.

He went on to question the meaning of Musk's statements, also noting of the tech billionaire, "I thought he was just, like, tweeting all day [on X] about how much OpenAI sucks, and our model is bad, and, you know, [we're] not gonna be a good company and all that." CNBC has reached out to Musk-owned X for comment. Altman and Musk have frequently exchanged barbs as part of a long-storied feud that dates back to their disagreement over the ultimate mission of OpenAI, which they co-founded in 2015 as a nonprofit AI research lab.

They're not here among us." Under the plans announced last night - and agreed by Israel's security cabinet - the Israeli military would take control of Gaza City, home to around one million people, with a view, it says, to disarming Hamas, freeing the hostages, and establishing security control over the Strip. The plan has been met with heavy condemnation by much of the international community, with United Nations (UN) human rights chief Volker Türk saying it would "result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes". AFP The Israeli military has continued to strike Gaza City in recent days "And it's going to be a death sentence to every Palestinian, I think the whole population in Gaza will be killed, either by bombardment or by hunger." Local resident Dr Hatem Qanoua said: "We're collapsing across every aspect of life: food, education, healthcare. They've only known death, destruction, and deprivation." More than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military began its operation, in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since the start of 2025, at least 99 people, including 29 children under the age of five, have died of malnutrition, according to the World Health Organization - which says its figures are likely underestimates.

Sponsor Message Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals "the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All." Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down. The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. "We and many others are prepared to take them to court," says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government , which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law "rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds." A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households. "By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills," Carley says. The Solar for All program, and the solar projects across the country, would have meant significant greenhouse gas reductions, says Costa Samaras, director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University.

"The even tougher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, which was decided last night by the Israeli Security Cabinet, makes it increasingly difficult for the [German] Federal Government to see how these goals can be achieved," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Friday. "Under these circumstances, the German government will not authorize any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice."

A host of celebrities descended on the area two weeks ago for the wedding of Eve Jobs, the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, and Harry Charles, a member of the British equestrian team at last summer’s Olympic Games in Paris.

"If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy," Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. When Trump announced the initial 90-day pause on "liberation day" tariffs in early April, the Nasdaq Composite rose 7% in just a few minutes, while other major averages also posted strong gains that week. Companies such as AMD and Marvell , as well as Apple , then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add some manufacturing in the U.S.

Article: In the July 31 letter which was a response to a Swiss gold refinery's request for clarification on tariffs, the CBP said one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars should be categorized under a customs code that market watchers say will not exempt them from reciprocal tariffs. The CBP said in its ruling letter that the bars in question should not be classified as unwrought non-monetary gold bullion or dore — which is categorized with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code 7108.12.10. He said uncertainty on gold tariffs "re-emerged" on the back of the FT publicizing the CBP's ruling, labeling the gold futures spike "a reprise of the importing rush" that took hold in late 2024 and earlier this year. In its ruling letter, the CBP told the Swiss refiner that its one-kilogram and 100-ounce bars failed to qualify in the 7108.12.10 category, as they had been stamped and needled or lasered with identifying information. Deutsche Bank's Hsueh said in his note that while it was too early to make any final judgements on the CBP's letter, "on the face of it the CBP ruling is applicable to [gold imported from] all countries." However, Hsueh suggested there could be ways for gold exporters to skirt around U.S. "The failure of tariff exemption is based on the nature of the manufactured gold bar and its HTS classification, rather than being dependent on the country of origin," he explained, referring to the International Trade Commission's Harmonized Tariff Schedule — the database that holds the customs codes for imported goods. "There is nothing in the CBP ruling which precludes the gold refiner from adjusting its operations to produce gold in a format which fits HTS code 7108.12.10, thereby qualifying for tariff exemption. This could take the form of a cast bar which is only minimally processed after the fact, or granules which are likely to also qualify as minimally processed." Jitters ahead The new ruling on tariffs surprised the gold market, according to Joni Teves, strategist at Swiss investment bank UBS. "This creates an issue for the global gold market which uses Comex gold futures to hedge positions, with the assumption that it can easily import metal into Comex warehouses in the US to physically settle contracts if needed," she said in a Friday note. "The tariff adds costs to this process, and with the bulk of refining capacity sitting in Switzerland which faces 39% US tariffs, these costs would be quite high." Teves argued that until there is clarity on gold tariffs, markets were likely to "remain jittery." "Historically, the vast majority of Swiss gold exports to the US have fallen under the 7108.12 (unwrought) category, which is exempted from tariffs," she said. "On average, this tariff-exempt category accounted for ~78% of Swiss gold flows to the US." Like Hseuh, UBS' Teves suggested that the gold industry may react by changing delivery standards — this could include allowing settlement in alternative locations such as London. "In the long run, the existence of US tariffs on deliverable gold products raises the question on the role of futures trading in the US as a means to hedge and whether other centres eventually step up as alternatives," Teves added. "There is still a lot of uncertainty around all this and until there is clarity, we expect the gold market and precious metals markets more generally to remain very nervous." Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, told CNBC on Friday that he was more bullish than ever on gold. In a world where the independence of the Fed lies in the balance and there are more questions about the long term sustainability of [government] debt, inflation will rise and we have to invest in real assets." "I think [gold] could go still higher," Gijsels added. "But indeed, it could be a rocky path." Deutsche Bank's Hseuh said in his note on Friday that much of the trajectory for gold depends on the intentions of the U.S. Either of these actions would risk creating a bifurcated gold market whereby metal circulating amongst buyers and sellers in the US becomes divorced from the volume of metal similarly circulating outside the US."

Article: England Lioness and Gotham FC defender Jess Carter said social media companies can do more to police hate comments online after she faced racial abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament. Carter, a defender for the American soccer team Gotham FC, is part of the England women's national team, nicknamed the "Lionesses," that just secured a historic win in the Euro 2025 championships after defeating Spain on penalties in the final in Switzerland in July. Carter had to take a step back from social media after facing intense racial abuse during the tournament and in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer, she shared how she's dealing with the online attacks. "I'm not someone who normally takes myself off social media, because I'm used to the critics and used to getting some of the abuse that we get as athletes and people in the public eye, as it happens a lot," Carter told Bryer. "So this time around, I think the way that I dealt with it was just to completely take myself off social media so that I wasn't able to see anything that was said and I could just focus on what was being said within my camp," she added. The England women's team came out in support of Carter after the abuse and decided not to take the knee — an anti-racism gesture — before the Euro 2025 matches, saying it is "clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism."

Then, a landmark study in 2006 showed that women randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet were no less likely to suffer from heart disease or stroke than people who ate more fat. A large randomized trial has shown benefits of a Mediterranean style-diet, and evidence from high-quality nutrition studies has shown a diet high in ultraprocessed foods results in eating more, leading to weight gain.

Article: River Island allowed to shut shops to stave off collapse 1 hour ago Share Save Rachel Clun Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images River Island has been given the green light to close 33 stores across the UK after the High Court approved the fashion retailer's restructuring plans. As well as closing shops, rents will be reduced at a further 71 branches as part of the plan which, River Island's chief executive Ben Lewis, said "will enable us to align our store estate to our customers' needs". Charles Allen, an intelligence analyst at Bloomberg, said River Island had failed to keep up with customer tastes which, he said "can be a bit fickle" but the retailer had found itself without "anything striking". Mr Weaver also said that River Island was forecast to be unable to pay its debts from late August or early September, with a projected shortfall of more than £43m. Nick Sherrard, managing director at consultancy Label Sessions, said that while the company has been saved from collapse for now, marketing and creative teams need to get to work to get consumers to care about its products. "There are very few examples of companies shrinking into greatness." The restructuring will involve closing 33 stores from January 2026, and negotiating with the landlords of a further 71 stores to reduce rents in some cases to zero.

Article: A spokesperson for James called them a "weaponization of the justice system." New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a news conference outside Manhattan federal court in New York on Feb. Federal prosecutors in Albany have issued subpoenas to New York Attorney General Letitia James inquiring about her office's civil fraud case against President Donald Trump and corruption case against the National Rifle Association, multiple sources told ABC News. A spokesperson for James called the subpoenas a "weaponization of the justice system," invoking a criticism Trump used to describe her case against him that resulted in a half-billion-dollar penalty. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights," the spokesperson said in a statement. Yuki Iwamura/AP, FILE James sued the NRA in 2020, accusing the gun rights group's former CEO, Wayne LaPierre, and others of misappropriating donor funds to finance luxury items for themselves. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, are part of an investigation into whether James and her office violated the civil rights of Trump or the NRA executives, the sources said. An attorney for James, Abbe Lowell, called the probe "a dangerous escalation" and "the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign." "If prosecutors carry out this improper tactic and are genuinely interested in the truth, we are ready and waiting with the facts and the law," Lowell said in a statement.
