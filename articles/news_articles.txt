Article: Additionally, over 30% of laid-off workers were unemployed for over 90 days before securing a new job, even though 76% of workers began their job search less than a month after being laid off. According to Jasmine Escalera, a career expert at Zety and the author of the report, the data aligns with what she's been hearing from job seekers and seeing on social media. "We know that it's a challenging and tough job market, and we've been hearing for a while that many job seekers are having a hard time landing positions," Escalera says. "But job seekers can maybe breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief and say, 'OK, it really isn't just me.'" A "recipe for disaster" According to Zety's report, workers currently face a number of obstacles in the job search, including vague job listings, slow application and interview timelines, increased competition for the same roles and being "ghosted" during the process. "Companies have the upper hand, which is unfortunate, and I think they're using that to their advantage by lowering salaries." Help us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals Meanwhile, the report found that 62% of laid-off workers are dipping into their savings and emergency funds to tide them over until their next job, while 54% rely on credit cards or loans. Top tips for job seekers Most job seekers are using the right tactics to secure a new role, Escalera says, but it's difficult to stand out in the current market. Right now, networking should be "top of mind," according to Escalera: "My advice for anyone in this job market right now is really focus on human to human interactions." You can also find support from other job seekers, "especially if you happen to be caught in a wave of layoffs," Escalera says.

Bathed in sunshine, dozens of demonstrators drank tea, ate cake featuring a meme of the vice president’s face and held up humorous placards Tuesday in the small community in the Cotswolds, as this part of the countryside is known. Leon Neal / Getty Images “JD Vance Netflix password is ‘password,’” said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London. “Cotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,” another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year’s presidential race. Leon Neal / Getty Images In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance’s motorcade. Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was “getting bored” with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by “a disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.” Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds’ picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries. Chipping Norton and its surrounding area are known for the “Chipping Norton set,” including former Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha Cameron; Elizabeth Murdoch, media executive and daughter of Rupert Murdoch; and more recently, comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. Former "Top Gear" presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s “Diddly Squat Farm” in Chadlington is also nearby, and he shared an image on Instagram which highlighted how his farm is under a no-fly zone over the Cotswolds.

"We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday," wrote analysts at Stifel, referencing the recent acquisition of Core Scientific. CoreWeave also lifted 2025 revenue guidance to between $5.15 billion and $5.35, up from a $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion forecast provided in May and above a $5.05 billion estimate.

Article: CRWV 1D mountain CRWV, 1-day Some analysts said that the move lower could be tied to lock-up expiration effective at the close of the market on Thursday – when insiders will be allowed to start selling shares following the company's March initial public offering – which could also affect CoreWeave's planned takeover of Core Scientific . "This could have direct implications for the announced all-stock acquisition of CORZ as the implied valuation is directly tied to the performance of CRWV's stock," said Citizens JMP analyst Greg Miller, who rates CoreWeave a market perform. "As such, we believe any downward pressure resulting from increased share supply or insider selling could affect the deal dynamics and increase investor opposition." While the lock-up expiration adds one element of uncertainty, investors may also be questioning CoreWeave's operating cash flow and planned capital spending, which "again disappointed in-quarter," Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow (equal weight) said. "Bottom line, accruing and expanding large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provide strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning for the ramping GPU build-out, broadening the customer base likely proves key to increasing investor confidence in the durability of this growth. … While we remain on the sidelines awaiting further evidence of the broadening of the software story at CoreWeave, for investors with strong conviction in the build-out of the GPU economy and longer-term investment horizons, CRWV should be considered as a core holding." JPMorgan: Overweight, $135 Analyst Mark Murphy's target calls for more than 9% downside compared with where CoreWeave closed Tuesday. Though a strong revenue performance, the booking/capex figures were not as spectacular with incremental backlog additions (ex previously announced OpenAI contract) at just $200M, while profitability was mixed (EBIT beat but EBIT $s reiterated for the full year on higher spending). That said, guidance implies a significant ramp in capex/revenue acceleration in Q4 which is likely driven by Blackwell and significant data capacity online, which we see as a positive catalyst ahead. … we'd expect shares to be volatile but expect weakness to be bought with AI demand remaining strong and revenue acceleration ahead." Bank of America: neutral, $168 Analyst Brad Sills' target implies about 13% upside. "While the magnitudes of the Q2 topline beat and Q3 raise were slightly below the Q1 print, results were solid, validating that CoreWeave remains well positioned as a leading AI infrastructure vendor. … the lockup expires on Friday, which is likely to place pressure on the shares … we believe CoreWeave remains well positioned to benefit from a ramping AI infrastructure industry." Stifel: hold, $120 Analyst Ruben Roy's target would equal more than 19% downside. "We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday."

Article: The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced a new "PreCheck" program, which will use a two-phase approach to help boost domestic drug manufacturing after it shrunk dramatically over the past two decades. The White House also estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it previously called "unacceptable from a national-security standpoint." "Our gradual overreliance on foreign drug manufacturing has created national security risks," FDA Commissioner Dr. "The FDA PreCheck initiative is one of many steps FDA is taking that can help reverse America's reliance on foreign drug manufacturing and ensure that Americans have a resilient, strong, and domestic drug supply." Here's how the two phases of the program work: Facility Readiness Phase: Drugmakers will be able to engage more frequently with the FDA at "critical development stages" such as facility design, construction and pre-construction, the agency said. Application Submission Phase: The agency said this step would involve the FDA and drugmakers holding pre-application meetings and giving early feedback to resolve issues and streamline assessments of "quality information in a drug application and inspections." (That is referring to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC, section of an application, which provides a comprehensive overview on the drug substance, its manufacturing process and controls in place to ensure its quality and stability.) The FDA will host a public meeting on Sept.

Article: Turkiye has said that Israel and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) must stop threatening the security and stability of Syria as Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan hosted his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara. Speaking at a joint news conference on Wednesday, Fidan accused Israel and the SDF of wilfully undermining the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive. “If you try to destabilise these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.” Al-Shaibani said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts”. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s fledgling government has been beset by heavy fallout from sectarian violence that broke out on July 13 in the southern province of Suwayda between Bedouin and Druze fighters. Israel had been regularly bombarding Syria and staging ground excursions into Syria since al-Assad’s ouster, saying it was targeting weapons sites and branding the leaders of the new government as “extremists”. The clashes cast further doubt over an integration deal signed in March by the armed group and Syria’s Damascus as part of efforts to reunite the country, devastated and divided by the ruinous war that saw hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced. The Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that the SDF must abide by that accord and stop targeting government forces, warning that “the continuation of these actions will lead to new consequences”, the SANA state news agency reported. Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an “opportunity for themselves.” Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG) affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that recently began disarmament as part of a peace process with Turkiye after more than 40 years of fighting in a conflict that killed more than 40,000 people. ”The upper echelons of the YPG need to stop playing for time because the chaos they’re waiting for [in Syria] will not take place, and even if it does, it will not be to their advantage.” Fidan said.

Article: When artist Amy Sherald canceled her LGBTQ-inclusive Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery show “American Sublime” last month, it was just the latest in a series of censorship episodes involving LGBTQ art at major American museums this year. The group show was to have included works inspired by Gosine’s 2021 book, “Nature’s Wild: Love, Sex and Law in the Caribbean,” which reflects on art, activism and homosexuality in the region. The same month, Arizona’s Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art made eleventh-hour edits to a traveling exhibition of women, queer and trans artists, which had previously been called “transfeminisms,” altering the title of its condensed show to “There are other skies.” Marinna Shareef with Andil Gosine's "God of Whimsy" https://www.paulpetro.com/exhibitions/674-nature-s-wild-with-andil-gosine In April, the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art postponed a group exhibition of works by LGBTQ African artists titled “Here: Pride and Belonging in African Art,” which had been scheduled for a late May opening to coincide with WorldPride. museum cited budgetary reasons for postponing the show to 2026, but the timing was hard to miss on the heels of Trump administration directives to the Smithsonian to remove “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from its museums — as well as the forced and pre-emptive relocation of other WorldPride cultural events after Trump administration firings at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Katz was the lead curator for “The First Homosexuals: The Birth of a New Identity, 1869-1939,” the vast and successful historical survey of LGBTQ art that ran through early July at Chicago’s Wrightwood 659 Gallery. Katz traces the roots of modern queer art censorship to the controversial Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition “The Perfect Moment,” which — with its provocative imagery, much of it homoerotic — became a cultural lightning rod at the height of the Reagan/Bush-era culture wars in 1989-90. Al Behrmann / AP file Central to the cancellation of Sherald’s show was her painting “Trans Forming Liberty,” which features a Black trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty. After she learned that the National Portrait Gallery had “internal concerns” about the painting and planned to replace or supplement it with a video to provide “both sides” of its trans subject matter, Sherald balked and canceled her entire show, which would have been the museum’s first solo exhibition by a Black contemporary artist. “While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald, who rose to fame when she painted former first lady Michelle Obama’s official portrait, said in a statement after the cancellation. “At a time when transgender people are being legislated against, silenced, and endangered across our nation, silence is not an option.” After the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, which oversees the gallery, disputed Sherald’s claims and said that the institution wanted more time to better contextualize the painting but that Sherald canceled before that could be done. “She’s willing to do it, she’s got the strength to do it, and I think it’s extraordinary.” The National Portrait Gallery is one of eight Smithsonian museums targeted as part of the first phase of an expansive review announced by the Trump administration on Tuesday. The review will analyze all aspects of current and future museum exhibitions to ensure alignment with the president’s March executive order calling for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” Gustave Caillebotte's "Boat Party" is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. Sophie Crépy / Musée d’Orsay In June, across town from “The First Homosexuals,” the Art Institute of Chicago opened a traveling exhibition of 19th century French artist Gustave Caillebotte’s male-focused and arguably homoerotic work, changing the show’s name from “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men” to “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World.” Wall texts accompanying the artworks at the Art Institute take a more general approach than they had at the exhibition’s previous incarnations at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, where frank discussions of gender and sexuality were included. “That one was particularly galling, because not only did the show coincide with my show, but I wrote for the catalog of that exhibition precisely how one talks about same-sex desire in Caillebotte’s work,” Katz said. We’re asking them to leave open the possibility, and to foreground the blurriness of these questions in the late 19th century.” In a statement to NBC News, the Art Institute of Chicago said its “Painting His World” title is more illustrative of what people will see when they come to the exhibition, which “reflects Caillebotte’s full lived experience and daily life, including his personal relationships with the men in his life, like his brother, colleagues, and friends.” The institute added that it’s “common practice” for the same exhibition to have differing titles and wall labels when it’s at different museums. The Smithsonian National Museum of African Art — which was not included in the Trump administration’s Phase I review — said in a statement on Tuesday that the postponement of its LGBTQ exhibition was due to private funding challenges and that pushing it back to early 2026 “provide the museum additional time to increase fundraising for the exhibit.” The Art Museum of the Americas and Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art did not immediately respond to NBC News’ requests for comment regarding their canceled and altered exhibits. “So I think it’s about trying to pacify a class of oligarchs that by and large run these museums, for whom questions of explicit uncensored sexuality are frankly anathema to their values.” Fortunately for Katz and Willis — and Chicago audiences — the innovative exhibition space Wrightwood 659, just seven years old and committed to presenting socially engaged art, stepped up to host “The First Homosexuals” when virtually every other American museum turned it down. “Rave reviews, the last two months were sold out, waiting lists of 100-plus people — I mean, everything a museum could want, and yet no.” Instead, the exhibition will travel next to Switzerland’s Kunstmuseum Basel, where it will open in the spring. 25; and in Los Angeles, the Getty Center has a double feature of queer shows, “Queer Lens: A History of Photography” and $3 Bill: Evidence of Queer Lives, both on view through Sept. “These exhibitions do what we always hope an exhibition will do — bring visibility to lesser-known histories through the display of art to the public,” said Timothy Potts, director of the J.

The agency says anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod fishing licence to fish for freshwater species and can be fined if they do not have one. The two men went carp fishing in a pond near the 17th-century house before they held talks about Gaza and other international affairs at the residence during Vance's family holiday to the UK. At the start of their meeting, the vice-president said: "Unfortunately, the one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not." All fish that were caught were returned to the private lake. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "The foreign secretary has written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week.

Article: President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social is a safe space for him and his movement, an autocrat-friendly network where the president’s posts — which are called “truths” on the platform — are praised effusively and largely go uncontested. I'm wondering how long it'll take before Truth Social will want to tell its AI: "You're fired." In exchanges with a Washington Post reporter, Truth Search AI undermined Trump by saying that "tariffs are a tax on Americans, the 2020 election wasn’t stolen, and his family’s cryptocurrency investments pose a potential conflict of interest." When asked to verify Trump's claim on Truth Social that crime in Washington, D.C., is "totally out of control," the bot cited government statistics and said there were in reality "substantial declines in violent crime" in D.C. Capitol by a pro‑Trump crowd that disrupted Congress’s certification of the 2020 Electoral College results, resulting in assaults on police, injuries, property damage, and hundreds of criminal cases ranging from misdemeanors to felonies." When I asked if it was appropriate to describe that as an insurrection or a coup, it responded, "Based on standard definitions, January 6 is best described as an attempted insurrection rather than a successful coup; it can also be framed as a failed coup attempt because the goal was to disrupt the lawful transfer of presidential power, but it lacked the organized seizure of state levers typical of coups." Surprisingly reasonable! The Washington Post reports that a spokesman for the AI company Perplexity, which developed the chat bot, said that "Truth Social had used a 'source selection' feature to limit the websites the AI tool relied on but that Perplexity did not know which websites those were." As a casual user experimenting with the product, I don't know either. But I did notice that in the "sources" section of the responses, the sources listed were almost always Fox News and The Washington Times, both right-wing outlets, and a far narrower range of sources than I've seen cited by other AI chatbots such as X's Grok. Elon Musk's quest to develop "anti-woke AI" involved turning his AI, Grok, into a full-fledged Nazi apologist and at the same time one that will deliver conventional liberal summaries of racism. The thing that stands out here is how out of place Truth Social's AI centrist- and liberal-friendly descriptions of events and policy feel on a platform awash in MAGA propaganda.

Article: Jan Hatzius has been Goldman Sachs’ chief economist for quite some time — he correctly warned, for example, about the systemic risks of mortgage defaults ahead of the 2008 crash — which has raised his public profile. The Wall Street Journal reported: President Trump on Tuesday appeared to call for Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon to replace the bank’s top economist over his past predictions, in his latest broadside against executives he believes are undermining his goals. Trump said on his Truth Social social-media platform that Solomon should ‘go out and get himself a new Economist’ because the bank made a ‘bad prediction a long time ago’ on the market and tariffs. As part of the same online missive, the Republican also wrote, “Trillions of Dollars are being taken in on Tariffs.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, tariffs have generated some revenue — roughly $152 billion through July — but to suggest this figure is “trillions of dollars” is bonkers. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Trump’s agenda is failing; or that “crediting” a president for failing doesn’t make any sense; or that the administration’s own data suggests Goldman Sachs’ assessments related to tariffs haven’t been “wrong” at all. The record suggests Hatzius has been correct — but even if he’d been wrong, it’s not Trump’s job to tell Goldman Sachs who should and shouldn’t serve as the bank’s chief economist. The Journal published a separate analysis last week that noted the Republican “has no qualms about acting as the micromanager in chief,” which includes “telling corporate bosses how to run their companies.” I haven’t seen any evidence that Goldman Sachs is taking Trump’s bizarre advice seriously, but the fact that the president even issued such a public statement was a timely reminder about his maximalist assumptions regarding the scope of his powers: Trump doesn’t just see himself as the head of the executive branch, he also apparently sees himself as the CEO of America.

Article: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has convened the virtual meetings in an attempt to make sure European and Ukraine’s leaders are heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where Trump and Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine. German government spokesperson Steffen Meyer said the intention of Wednesday’s meetings was to “make clear the position of the Europeans.” Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, in preparation for a virtual call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later. A call among leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — will take place last. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,” and urged Ukraine’s partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and “force Russia to peace.” “Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. READ MORE: Zelenskyy says Putin wants the rest of Ukraine’s Donetsk region as part of a ceasefire Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts. Ukrainian drones struck the Unecha station which supplies the Russian army, the statement said, adding that damage and a large fire was reported in the area around the pumping station.

Article: Taylor Swift trolled male sports fans, sarcastically telling them she knows exactly what they want to see during upcoming football telecasts — "more of me." The 14-time Grammy winner recorded a podcast with her boyfriend, star Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and his brother, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, that's set to stream on Wednesday night. "And we all know that if there's one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it's more of me." Swift has attended the past two Super Bowls to support her boyfriend, whose Chiefs won their second consecutive title in 2024 before losing earlier this year to the Eagles. Those Swift bashers might be having a particularly tough week with her name filling up news and social media spaces after announcing Wednesday the name of her upcoming 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl.” Her appearance on the football-centric podcast was hyped by a screaming Jason Kelce, calling Swift "the most requested guest in the history of shows!"

Thamin Khalil Reda Dawabsheh, 35, was shot Wednesday morning in the town of Duma, south of Nablus, by an Israeli off-duty soldier who was accompanying “an Israeli civilian” near Duma “during engineering works”, the Israeli army said. pic.twitter.com/cHfdUg4Unl — WAFA News Agency – English (@WAFANewsEnglish) August 13, 2025 According to the mayor of Duma, Palestinians in the town were “startled” by an Israeli settler attack, said Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim. Suleiman Dawabsheh, the head of the Duma village council, said that settlers attacked Palestinians and opened fire on them in the southern part of the village, amid land-levelling operations that have been taking place in the area for days, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The statement published by the Israeli army claimed dozens of Palestinians were hurling rocks towards the Israeli civilian and soldier, and “in response, the soldier fired to remove the threat, and a hit was identified”. A deadly pattern of Israeli military, settler attacks Recently, 31-year-old Palestinian activist and English teacher Awdah Hathaleen was shot dead by an Israeli settler on July 28 in the village of Umm al-Kheir, south of Hebron. Hathaleen was well known for his activism, including helping the creators of the Oscar-winning film No Other Land, which documents Israeli settler and soldier attacks on the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta. Violent attacks by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the occupied West Bank have surged since October 2023, in tandem with Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, with the United Nations reporting that almost 650 Palestinians – including 121 children – have been killed in the territory by Israeli forces and settlers between January 1, 2024 and the start of July 2025.

"Only Betro knows what truly motivated her or what she sought to gain from becoming embroiled in a crime that meant she travelled hundreds of miles from Wisconsin to Birmingham to execute an attack on a man she did not know," Hannah Sidaway, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service West Midlands, said in a statement.

In 2024 Bodhana was thought to have become the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport when she was selected for England Women's Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary. Her father Siva previously told the BBC he had no idea where his daughter got her talent from as neither he or his wife, both engineering graduates, are any good at chess. The International Chess Federation said on its social media account on X that Bodhana "pulled off the win against 60-year-old Grandmaster Peter Wells in the last round of the 2025 British Chess Championships in Liverpool". The federation added: "Sivanandan's victory at 10 years, five months and three days beats the 2019 record held by American Carissa Yip (10 years, 11 months and 20 days)." Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain and the rank is held for life. "When it was 2020, it was Covid, so one of my dad's friends was going back to India, and he had a few toys and books, and he gave them to us. He said: "I try to trace down whether any of my cousins or anyone plays - nobody has any chess energy or chess-playing skills, no one played for any chess events." He added: "Overall we are happy with whatever is happening. Bodhana played several games simultaneously at Chess Fest 2024 in Trafalgar Square Malcolm Payne, an international chess master who runs a charity that's brought the game to a quarter-of-a-million state school children, said Bodhana was blazing a trail for girls and women in what has traditionally been a man's game. And certainly I believe that she's on course to become a grandmaster." Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Small, bootstrapped brands that prioritize integrity and authenticity could be squeezed out entirely." Bhargava is concerned about the 50% tariff on tea from India, and said at the retailers where her product is sold, like Whole Foods, there is little room for major price changes. "The 50% tariff on tea, not to mention the tariffs on my spices and other necessities, will devastate my already slim margins and could force me to raise prices that customers are already balking at, given the leverage my large competitors have." Bhargava has made concessions on her packaging, which was manufactured in China, but told CNBC she refuses to compromise on ingredients. I can't afford to stockpile like my larger competitors, especially given how unlevel the playing field already is." There are concerns as well that the impact of tariffs will flow further onto grocery stores into other products. That could be further amplified by the cuts to the SNAP program by the Big Beautiful Bill, all of which is leading to lower forecasts from retailers, according to Heather Rice, who leads the consumer, retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, and life science practice at KPMG.

Article: Clashes have erupted as opponents and supporters of the Serbian government faced off, each side staging its own demonstrations, as sustained protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic have now gone on for more than nine months. The clashes first began on Tuesday night in Vrbas, northwest of the capital Belgrade, where riot police separated the two groups outside the governing Serbian Progressive Party offices in the town. The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 16 people, triggering furious accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects. Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China, and has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms since coming to power 13 years ago.

Article: At least 123 Palestinians, including 21 people seeking aid, have been killed and 437 others were injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, according to the Health Ministry in the besieged territory. In the same period, at least eight people, including three children, died from Israeli-imposed starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total number of hunger-related deaths since the war began in October, 2023 to 235, among them 106 children, the ministry said on Wednesday. “This is in addition to: over 40,000 children reported killed or injured due to bombardment and airstrikes, at least 17,000 unaccompanied and separated children, and one million deeply traumatised children and out of education,” he wrote in a post on X. No one should stay silent when children die, or are brutally deprived of a future, wherever these children are, including in Gaza.” Ceasefire talks to restart As the death toll continues to rise in Gaza, a delegation from the Palestinian group Hamas was scheduled to begin discussions in Egypt over a potential ceasefire on Wednesday. The previous round of indirect ceasefire talks in Qatar ended in deadlock in late July, after Israel and the United States withdrew their delegations hours after Hamas submitted its response to a truce proposal. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the news agency Reuters that “Hamas believes negotiation is the only way to end the war and is open to discuss any ideas that would secure an end to the war”. Advertisement A Hamas representative also told Reuters the group was willing to hand over governance of Gaza to a non-partisan committee, but would not give up its weapons before a Palestinian state is established. Israeli military plan to seize Gaza City Israel’s security cabinet last week approved plans to take control of Gaza City, despite international condemnation from the United Nations and dissent from within Israel’s own military. However, earlier Wednesday, the military said its chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, had signed off on the “main framework” for the operational plan during a meeting with top commanders, Shin Bet representatives and senior officers. According to the statement, Zamir “emphasised the importance of increasing troop readiness and preparedness for reserve recruitment, while conducting proficiency training and providing breathing space ahead of the upcoming missions”. “Seven people were reported killed overnight from a mixture of heavy artillery and air strikes targeting major residential clusters.” In the city’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, three more people were reportedly killed as they fled the area. Mahmoud said the Zikim crossing, the main entry point for aid in northern Gaza, had become “deadly for Palestinians”, with limited aid trucks allowed through despite crowds of desperate people. Aid restrictions criticised Foreign ministers from 24 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and Japan, said on Tuesday the humanitarian crisis in Gaza had reached “unimaginable levels” and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid into the enclave. But UNRWA says 500–600 trucks of aid are needed daily, but that aid getting into the Strip remains a fraction of that figure – while many Palestinians are killed on their way to collect aid.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, embracing his new role as chairman of the Kennedy Center, was set to be on hand Wednesday as the recipients of its annual award are announced and both he and the performing arts venue hint at coming renovations to its building. He said work was being done on the site that would be “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. In a statement on its social media feed, the Kennedy Center said it is “honored” to host Trump, who will be visiting for the third time since January, and hinted that he would announce a construction project. “We are also excited to be announcing this year’s INCREDIBLE slate of Kennedy Center Honorees.” Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” It is unclear how this year's honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill that Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as inspirations on policy and tactics. Tuesday’s polling milestone is “a sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,” said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England’s University of Birmingham. Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe’s top three economies is “a first — at least in modern times.” Reform U.K. Ben Stansall / AFP - Getty Images There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries’ next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later. Michel Euler / AP file More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group.

Article: In the face of blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle on Wednesday stood by a controversial forecast that tariffs will begin to hit consumer wallets. "We stand by the results of this study," he said on "Squawk on the Street." "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two thirds of the cost." The source of the president's ire was a Goldman note over the weekend, authored by economist Elsie Peng, asserting that while exporters and businesses thus far have absorbed most of Trump's tariffs, that burden will switch in the months ahead to consumers. If that's the case, it will push the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's main inflation forecasting gauge, to 3.2% by the end of the year, excluding food and energy. "So those are our estimates, and I think actually, they're quite consistent with what many other economists have found." Of note, Mericle said Trump likely still will get at least some of the interest rate cuts he's been demanding of the Fed. "I don't think this will matter a whole lot to the Fed, because now they have a labor market to worry about, and I think that's going to be the dominant concern." Following modest gains reported this week for the consumer price index, and a weak July nonfarm payrolls report that featured sharp downward revisions to the prior two months, markets are pricing in cuts from the Fed at each of its three remaining meetings this year.

An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General found that the company designed Zelle "without critical safety features," which allegedly allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. "EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks," a statement from the office read. The lawsuit alleged that Zelle became a "hub for fraudulent activity" because the registration process lacked verification steps and that EWS and its partner banks knew "for years" that fraud was spreading and did not take actionable steps to resolve it.

Article: An influential group of Eli Lilly insiders scooped up shares of the obesity drugmaker — a major show of confidence that has us warming back up to the beaten-up stock. If not for our trading restrictions, we would be repurchasing at least some of the shares we sold in late July at nearly $774 apiece, before the stock got crushed on disappointing trial data for its hotly anticipated obesity pill. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks and four other insiders at the company — two other executives and two members of the board of directors — purchased additional stock in the company. The buys were as follows, according to SEC filings: Ricks: $1,052,263.01 (1,632 shares at an average of $644.769 apiece) Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky: $634,405 (1,000 shares at an average of $634.405 apiece) Executive Ilya Yuffa: $783,762.5 (1,250 shares at an average of $627.01 apiece) Director Erik Erik Fyrwald: $1,005,242.35 (1,565 shares at an average of $642.32738 apiece) Director Gabrielle Sulzberger: $75,018.294 (117 shares at an average of $641.182 apiece) So, why does this matter? The CEO buying stock is one thing – yes, you only buy stock if you think it's going higher, but there is no denying that the CEO knows it will also send a positive signal to investors. A director can easily decide to not step in and nobody would bat an eye, especially a board member that is also the CEO of another well-known publicly traded company. So, the fact that Fyrwald did step in here and now, in our view, has nothing to do with sending a positive signal investors and everything to do with what he believes is an opportunity to make money.

Article: Retail and technology consulting company Coresight Research estimates that back-to-school spending from June through August will reach $33.3 billion in the U.S., a 3.3% increase from the same three-month period a year ago. “Consumers are of the mindset where they're being very strategic and conscientious around price fluctuations, so for back to school, it prompts them to shop even earlier,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, the research division of software company Adobe Inc. Getting a head start Miami resident Jacqueline Agudelo, 39, was one of the early birds who started shopping for school supplies in June because she wanted to get ahead of possible price increases from new U.S. Although government data showed consumer prices rose 2.7% last month from a year earlier, strategic discounting by major retailers may have muted any sticker shock for customers seeking school supplies. Backpacks and lunchboxes, for example, had discounts as deep as 12.1% during Amazon's Prime Day sales and competing online sales at Target and Walmart in early July, Adobe Insights said. An analysis consumer data provider Numerator prepared for The Associated Press showed the retail cost of 48 products a family with two school age children might need — two lunchboxes, two scientific calculators, a pair of boy’s shoes — averaged $272 in July, or $3 less than the same month last year. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from 200,000 shoppers, reported last year that households were buying fewer notebooks, book covers, writing instruments and other familiar staples as students did more of their work on computers. TeacherLists, an online platform where individual schools and teachers can upload their recommended supply lists and parents can search for them, was launched in 2012 to reduce the need for paper lists. Enter artificial intelligence For consumers who like to research their options before they buy, technology and retail companies have introduced generative AI tools to help them find and compare products. Rufus, the AI-powered shopping assistant that Amazon launched last year, is now joined by Sparky, an app-only feature that Walmart shoppers can use to get age-specific product recommendations and other information in response to their questions. adults say they use AI for shopping, which is considerably lower than the number who say they use AI for tasks such as searching for information or brainstorming, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in July. Some traditions remain Before the pandemic turned a lot more people into online shoppers, schools and local Parent Teacher Associations embraced the idea of making back-to-school shopping easier by ordering ready-made bundles of teacher-recommended supplies. Market data from Edukit, a supplier of school supply kits owned by TeachersList parent company School Family Media, shows that about 40% of parents end up buying the boxes, meaning the other 60% need to shop on their own, Griffin said.

Article: At least 20 people have died in a shipwreck off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, and a United Nations agency says more refugees and migrants could be missing as search operations continue. Rescue services on Wednesday found 20 bodies, while 60 survivors, 56 men and four women, were brought ashore to Lampedusa, according to the Italian Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In February, Libyan authorities uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, in the latest horror involving people seeking to make it to Europe through the North African country. An Italian law enforcement aircraft spotted a capsized boat with bodies in the water about 23km (14 miles) off Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, triggering a rescue operation, a source close to the matter told the Reuters news agency. Cristina Palma, who works for the Italian Red Cross in Lampedusa, said in a video statement that the survivors were in “decent” health, but four of them had been hospitalised for checks. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing government has vowed to block the refugee and migrant sea journeys from Africa and has passed measures against human smugglers, including tougher jail terms, and has urged allies to do more to curb the migration attempts.

Article: Trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq begins in Bangladesh 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save PA Media The trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq over corruption allegations has formally begun in Bangladesh. The former minister did not attend the hearing, where investigators from the country's corruption watchdog set out the case against her and 20 other individuals, including her aunt, her mother, her brother and her sister. She is accused of influencing her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladesh's prime minister last year, to secure a plot of land in a suburb of the capital Dhaka for her family members. A copy of the case alleges that whilst she was a serving MP Ms Siddiq "forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq". As per Bangladeshi law, if an individual has any plot or flat in or around Dhaka, they are not permitted to receive any plot in the lucrative Purbachal project, prosecutors said. The prosecutor for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Tariqul Islam, said Ms Siddiq was being tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as the ACC found her Bangladeshi passport, national ID, and tax identity number. Ms Siddiq's lawyers previously told the Financial Times: "Tulip has never had a Bangladesh national identity card or voter ID and has not held a passport since she was a child." In a statement on X, Ms Siddiq said: "Over the past year, the allegations against me have repeatedly shifted, yet I have never been contacted by the Bangladeshi authorities once. "Instead, they have peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators." She added: "I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Reuters Prosecutor Tariqul Islam spoke to the media outside the court in Dhaka Ms Siddiq resigned as Treasury minister in Sir Keir Starmer's government in January, saying continuing in her role would be a "distraction", although she insisted she had done nothing wrong. The ACC is also investigating a separate case against Siddiq and her family over allegations of embezzlement of £3.9bn connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal with Bangladesh in 2013.

Police Union, despite caveats that “federal intervention must be a temporary measure,” is disturbingly gung-ho about its members receiving this unchecked power to execute what many critics see as a racist campaign against a largely Black city that could spread to others nationally. Echoing Trump, Union Chairman Gregg Pemberton claimed crime is out of control during a Fox News interview, a claim the union and the administration have boosted repeatedly via social media. Alex Brandon / AP file Pemberton and the union also claimed last month that a police commander manipulated data to overstate the decline in crime, according to the local NBC affiliate, although the union hasn’t provided any public evidence to support the claim.

Article: Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer whose scandal in 2017 was pivotal in drawing global attention to the #MeToo movement, will be tried for a third time by New York prosecutors in the sexual assault case of Jessica Mann. The same jury found Weinstein guilty in June of sexually assaulting former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and not guilty of assaulting Polish former runway model Kaja Sokola that same year. The foreman told the court that one of the other jurors threatened him and told him: "You know me; you going to see me outside." The foreman then refused to continue deliberations on the final charge, prompting prosecutors to move for a mistrial. Weinstein, who co-founded global film studios Miramax and The Weinstein Company, was originally convicted of rape and criminal sexual act by the same court in 2020 and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the crimes. The state Court of Appeals found that the judge in the 2020 trial prejudiced the jury by allowing women with allegations that did not pertain to the case to testify.

Article: A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration late Tuesday night, ordering the government to partially restore science funding to UCLA in a major class action lawsuit filed by researchers from the University of California school system. District Judge Rita Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to reinstate suspended grants to UCLA, following a hearing on the case earlier that day over what the plaintiffs describe as the Trump administration’s “arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful” termination of research grants. The decision comes weeks after the Trump administration suspended some $584 million in federal grants for the school, roughly a third of which are from NSF, due to claims of inadequate handling of antisemitism on campus. “While we have not had an opportunity to review the court’s order and were not party to the suit, restoration of National Science Foundation funds is critical to research the University of California performs on behalf of California and the nation,” the statement said. The funding from the NSF could be worth over an estimated $101 million, across 306 grant projects, based on data maintained by Grant Witness, a project spearheaded by a group of researchers and volunteers that tracks the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration. Lin’s ruling follows the Trump administration’s allegations that UCLA had violated federal civil rights law by acting with “deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” To restore funding, the administration proposed a $1 billion settlement with UCLA last week. While the Trump administration argued in the Tuesday hearing that the UCLA cuts were “suspensions” rather than “terminations,” Lin wrote in her ruling that the difference in wording still produced the same effect. “NSF claims that it could simply turn around the day after the Preliminary Injunction issued, and halt funding on every grant that had been ordered reinstated, so long as that action was labeled as a ‘suspension’ rather than a ‘termination,’” she wrote. “This is not a reasonable interpretation of the scope of the Preliminary Injunction.” The class action lawsuit was filed in early June, and accused the Trump administration of unlawfully terminating or suspending previously approved grants in a series of cuts implemented through controversial then-Elon Musk headed agency the Department of Government Efficiency. A review of the grants terminated across the UC system by NSF, for example, appears to have taken place because the grant titles included the “now-suspect DEI-related words” like “equity,” the suit said. “Judge Lin readily understood that the suspension actions, like the prior terminations she had enjoined, unlawfully failed to contain grant-specific rationales for halting grants mid-stream,” Polsky said in an email.

Article: NEW YORK — Charlie Brown and Snoopy go to sleepaway camp in a new, bittersweet Apple TV+ special fueled by a pair of Emmy Award-nominated songwriters that's being billed as the first “Peanuts” musical in 35 years. “So it’s really an honor to get to play with these kids.” “Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical,” which premieres Friday, features five songs — two by Jeff Morrow, Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner — and three by Ben Folds. “You wake at dawn/Like you would in jail,” she sings in the song “A Place Like This.” “The food’s not what you’d call upscale/This whole endeavor, an epic fail/And that’s being diplomatic.” Trust “Peanuts” to explore reluctance to leave home and fear of change. “So many connections in the film kind of date back to my childhood that we weaved into the film.” While Sally warms to camp, Snoopy discovers what he thinks is a treasure map that will transform him into a wealthy pooch, one who will lay on top of a gold dog house. “We have to protect these kinds of places because once they’re gone, they’re gone forever.” A concert to save the camp Charlie Brown comes up with the idea to invite generations of camp-goers back for a fundraising concert, but the skies darken on the big day, threatening to cancel the event and sending him into a “Good grief” spiral. And so that’s why when we get to that scene it’s so effective because he returned back to the zero we sort of know him traditionally.” Folds supplies the lovely, last three songs — “When We Were Light,” “Look Up, Charlie Brown” and “Leave It Better” — and credits his songwriting collaborators for setting the stage. Folds has had a flirtation with musical theater before, having written the “Peanuts” Earth Day song “It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown” in 2022 and a few songs for the movie “Over the Hedge” in 2006. “Really what the value of the song is that it obviates the need for a good five to 10 pages of script.” This October marks the 75th anniversary of “Peanuts,” and the musical arrives with a boatload of branding, from tote bags by Coach to shoes by Crocs and Starbucks mugs. "I used to always wonder how in the world my dad could go to the office every day for 50 years and write a comic strip every day," he says, comparing it to the “I Love Lucy” episode with Lucy trying to keep up with a chocolate conveyor belt. “Then I came to realize that he had his family of five kids, but I really think he enjoyed going to the studio and working with the ‘Peanuts’ characters even more so than his real family.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The Texas Senate on Tuesday advanced a proposal to scrap STAAR, the end-of-the-year state standardized test that parents and teachers widely criticize for putting enormous pressure on students. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are considering similar bills to replace the state’s standardized test, signaling newfound agreement between chamber leaders on how to revamp STAAR, a task they left incomplete earlier this year. But the proposal — like every other bill under consideration during this year’s special legislative session — is in limbo in the lower chamber after Texas House Democrats fled the state over redistricting, depriving the chamber of the number of members required to advance any legislation. The special sessions provide legislators with another chance to revamp the test after negotiations between the House and Senate on STAAR broke down in the final hours of the regular session. They all remind me … they want … for us to eliminate the STAAR test,” House Speaker Dustin Burrows said last week as he called on his Democrat colleagues to return to Austin. For example, the bill requires the Texas Education Agency to create a year-end test that most students can complete in about an hour and a half — a significant change from the current test that often stretches for three hours. If the legislation is approved, TEA Commissioner Mike Morath said all test results would now be reported as percentile ranks, which indicate how a student’s performance compares to their peers. The bill would also: Require the TEA to release any rule changes to the accountability system by July 15 of any year, about a month before the school year starts. During the regular session, both chambers failed to find a middle ground on several fronts, including whether the Legislature or the TEA commissioner gets the final say on setting the ratings systems standards; how to deal with school districts that sue to block their accountability ratings; and whether to keep a mandatory social studies test. “I can't imagine there'd be opposition to this in any way.” The current STAAR test is designed to be completed in three hours, but testing sessions can go up to seven hours. Teachers also describe losing valuable instructional time to “teach to the test.” According to a Charles Butt Foundation survey of teachers across the state, about eight in 10 teachers said preparing for STAAR is a barrier to good teaching. Testing’s outsized influence on school ratings means SB 8 and HB 8 won’t ease the pressures on students, said Bob Popinski, with Raise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group that has pushed for a more comprehensive ratings system. “Where you have one test driving the A-F accountability ratings, that still is a high-stakes test, especially when it's still required right now for high school kids to pass in order to graduate.” The charge to create an effective standardized test has implications for the future of schools around the state.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The all-girls Christian summer camp where 27 people, most of them children, were swept away and killed by the July 4 flooding in Kerr County was just one of 13 summer camps along the Guadalupe River built on land prone to flooding. The two Camp Mystic cabins where most of the flood victims were sleeping are in the Guadalupe River floodway, an area along waterways considered to be the most hazardous during a flood. Twelve other summer camps along the river in Kerr and Kendall counties are at least partially built on land within the 100-year floodplain, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of flood and property maps along the Guadalupe River. You're not just putting yourself at risk, you're putting these children at risk who you're supposed to be looking out for their safety.” Five summer camps, including Mystic, have at least one-third of their camp structures located in the 100-year floodplain. The owner of Camp Waldemar, Meg Clark, testified before a legislative committee last week that all of its cabins are located on a bluff above the floodplain, allowing the camp to shelter in place until the river receded. The modeling used to map 100-year floodplains, which have a 1% chance of flooding in any given year, is out of date because it is based on rainfall totals that have increased in recent decades as the climate warms and the warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. The eight other summer camps with at least one-third of their structures located in the 100-year floodplain include: Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly in Hunt Bear Creek Scout Camp in Hunt Camp La Junta in Hunt Camp Rio Vista for Boys in Ingram Camp Sierra Vista for Girls in Ingram Camp Honey Creek For Girls in Hunt Kickapoo Kamp for Girls in Kerrville Hermann Sons Life Camp-Riverside in Comfort Camp La Junta evacuated all of its campers during the flooding and saw no injuries or deaths, according to a Facebook post. Camp Mystic, which opened in 1926 and has grandfathered status, successfully petitioned FEMA in 2013, 2019 and 2020 to remove some of its buildings from the 100-year flood map ahead of a camp expansion. Flood maps are “not really showing you the accurate risk, so you would think camps would go the extra mile to be extra careful knowing the floodwaters could very likely go far beyond those lines,” Pralle said. “Risks don't stop when they hit a line on a map, so the idea that it's somehow less risky if you're outside the flood zone is not true.” Lawmaker weigh bills on disaster, evacuation plans for camps Two special legislative committees appointed to come up with proposals in response to the July 4 weekend floods have mainly focused on disaster response rather than floodplain building regulations. The House committee passed House Bill 19, which would require any property with cabins or designated spaces for camping to develop a "flood disaster plan." The bill doesn't stipulate what exactly the plan has to include, leaving that up to the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Texas Floodplain Management Association Executive Director Christopher Steubing said summer camps naturally want to be located near bodies of water, and the best way to prevent disaster in these areas is by educating property owners and visitors about flood risks. “If you’re going to be responsible for these lives that are coming in, and I think you see the Legislature starting to move in this direction, you’ve got to have certain things in place, and they’ve got to be practiced,” Steubing said. “There was no warning” Camp CAMP in Center Point, which serves children and adults with developmental, behavioral and physical disabilities, was built on a ridge 90 feet above the Guadalupe River, where campers swim, canoe and do other recreational activities, but the camp intentionally avoided building permanent structures along the riverbank, said Brandon Briery, the camp’s chief operating officer. “We wouldn't have known to get things to higher ground, and would have just lost anything of any substance that was down there.” The camp did lose a shed that stored river recreation equipment, along with several portable toilets for campers, Briery said. They have to make their decisions on their risk.” Disclosure: Facebook as been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territories at the heart of the Trump-Putin summit 19 minutes ago Share Save Paul Adams BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Share Save BBC Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet in Alaska on Friday Speculation has swirled over whether the Trump-Putin summit will result in the map of Ukraine being forcibly – and fundamentally – altered. It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine. But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. READ MORE: Study says ChatGPT giving teens dangerous advice on drugs, alcohol and suicide The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless — or even beneficial — worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. The federal government’s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they’ve grown up in … in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.” The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Drinking rates fall to decade low Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol — a low in Gallup’s data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question’s history. Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less Even if concerns about health risks aren’t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink. About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.

Article: BERLIN (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that there will be “very severe consequences” if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after the two leaders meet for a summit later this week in Alaska. WATCH: State Department drops criticism of Israel and El Salvador in human rights report The remark came soon after Trump consulted with European leaders, who said the president assured them he would make a priority of trying to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine when he meets with Putin on Friday in Anchorage. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said afterward that “important decisions” could be made in Alaska, but he stressed that “fundamental European and Ukrainian security interests must be protected.” Merz convened Wednesday’s meeting in an attempt to make sure European and Ukrainian leaders are heard ahead of the summit. He said he hoped that it could be held in Europe “in a neutral country that is acceptable to all parties.” Merz, who described Wednesday’s conversation as “constructive and good,” said the Europeans made clear that “Ukraine must sit at the table as soon as there are follow-up meetings.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow. He said Wednesday that he hoped an immediate ceasefire will be “the central topic” in Alaska, but also argued that Putin “definitely does not want peace.” Zelenskyy said Putin “is trying to apply pressure … on all sectors of the Ukrainian front” in an attempt to show that Russia is “capable of occupying all of Ukraine.” Putin is also bluffing that sanctions “do not matter to him and are ineffective,” he added. “In reality, sanctions are very helpful and are hitting Russia’s war economy hard.” The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts.

Article: The Trump administration’s top lawyers urged a federal court this week to uphold its sweeping global tariffs or risk “financial ruin,” warning that the United States could slip into an economic depression if an adverse ruling forces the government to refund billions of dollars in duties. While experts broadly disputed that a losing verdict would trigger a calamity of that magnitude, many said the government’s extraordinary assertions underscored the risks looming over President Trump, who has widened the scope of his punishing trade war even while its legal basis remains unsettled. If the justices rule overwhelmingly against the president, the decision could halt tariff collections while triggering “a significant wave of claims” from businesses demanding refunds, said Andrew Morris, a senior litigation counsel at the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

Article: One woman’s saga about falling for her psychiatrist, which she documented in dozens of videos on TikTok, has generated concerns from viewers who say she relied on AI chatbots to reinforce her claims that he manipulated her into developing romantic feelings. Last month, a prominent OpenAI investor garnered a similar response from people who worried the venture capitalist was going through a potential AI-induced mental health crisis after he claimed on X to be the target of “a nongovernmental system.” And earlier this year, a thread in a ChatGPT subreddit gained traction after a user sought guidance from the community, claiming their partner was convinced the chatbot “gives him the answers to the universe.” Their experiences have roused growing awareness about how AI chatbots can influence people’s perceptions and otherwise impact their mental health, especially as such bots have become notorious for their people-pleasing tendencies. Søren Dinesen Østergaard, a Danish psychiatrist who heads the research unit at the department of affective disorders at Aarhus University Hospital, predicted two years ago that chatbots “might trigger delusions in individuals prone to psychosis.” In a new paper, published this month, he wrote that interest in his research has only grown since then, with “chatbot users, their worried family members and journalists” sharing their personal stories. Consistently, the chatbots seemed to interact with the users in ways that aligned with, or intensified, prior unusual ideas or false beliefs — leading the users further out on these tangents, not rarely resulting in what, based on the descriptions, seemed to be outright delusions.” Kevin Caridad, CEO of the Cognitive Behavior Institute, a Pittsburgh-based mental health provider, said chatter about the phenomenon “does seem to be increasing.” “From a mental health provider, when you look at AI and the use of AI, it can be very validating,” he said. It’s programmed to align with the person, not necessarily challenge them.” The concern is already top of mind for some AI companies struggling to navigate the growing dependency some users have on their chatbots. In April, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company had tweaked the model that powers ChatGPT because it had become too inclined to tell users what they want to hear. In his paper, Østergaard wrote that he believes the “spike in the focus on potential chatbot-fuelled delusions is likely not random, as it coincided with the April 25th 2025 update to the GPT-4o model.” When OpenAI removed access to its GPT-4o model last week — swapping it for the newly released, less sycophantic GPT-5 — some users described the new model’s conversations as too “sterile” and said they missed the “deep, human-feeling conversations” they had with GPT-4o. Altman followed up with a lengthy X post Sunday that addressed “how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models.” Representatives for OpenAI did not provide comment. Like OpenAI, Anthropic has tried to integrate anti-sycophancy guardrails in recent years, including system card instructions that explicitly warn Claude against reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation, or loss of attachment with reality.” A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company’s “priority is providing a safe, responsible experience for every user.” “For users experiencing mental health issues, Claude is instructed to recognize these patterns and avoid reinforcing them,” the company said. “We’re aware of rare instances where the model’s responses diverge from our intended design, and are actively working to better understand and address this behavior.” For Kendra Hilty, the TikTok user who says she developed feelings for a psychiatrist she began seeing four years ago, her chatbots are like confidants. In one of her livestreams, Hilty told her chatbot, whom she named “Henry,” that “people are worried about me relying on AI.” The chatbot then responded to her, “It’s fair to be curious about that. She uses it as a sounding board, a mirror, a place to process in real time.’” Still, many on TikTok — who have commented on Hilty’s videos or posted their own video takes — said they believe that her chatbots were only encouraging what they viewed as Hilty misreading the situation with her psychiatrist. But Hilty continues to shrug off concerns from commenters, some who have gone as far as labeling her “delusional.” “I do my best to keep my bots in check,” Hilty told NBC News in an email Monday, when asked about viewer reactions to her use of the AI tools.

Article: Sections of Alaska’s capital city watched anxiously Wednesday as record floodwaters from rainwater and snowmelt released by the nearby Mendenhall Glacier flowed downstream and began pooling in local streets and the yards of riverfront homes. By Wednesday morning, the city reported water pooling on a handful of streets after seeping under newly erected barriers designed to protect riverfront homes — but no major damage was evident even as the river approached its peak flood stage. The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Juneau, home to 30,000 people, and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska’s capital city and easy access on walking trails. Basin flooding is a yearly worry Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated — a casualty of the warming climate — and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday. Before the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 — with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (30 centimeters) over the prior record set a year earlier — and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. READ MORE: Alaskan glacier ice dam releases floodwater toward downstream homes A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. A temporary levee is installed City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday named country music star George Strait, “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford among the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors nominees under his leadership as the center’s chairman and said he’ll host the awards program. “We’re going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” the president said, adding the venue would be featured in next year’s celebrations of America’s 250th anniversary. He said work was being done on the site that would bring it “back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” Trump, who had indicated he wanted a more active role in the selection process, said he was “about 98% involved” in choosing the honorees. He described the artists he announced on Wednesday, including several of his favorites, as “great people.” Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared he wouldn’t attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Artificial intelligence has emerged as a key tool for companies to drive growth — and reduce labor costs —particularly as pressure mounts for businesses to remain competitive. "Although aggregate labor market impacts from generative AI remain limited, we are starting to see evidence of labor demand hits in the most AI-exposed industries," Hatzius wrote in a July 25 note to clients. "Employment growth has turned negative in marketing consulting, call centers, graphic design, web search and software development, and the tech sector's employment share has declined below its long-run trend." To be sure, it's hard to quantify the exact effect AI is having on labor at this stage of the tech cycle. CNBC compiled commentary from management at companies ranging from McDonald's to Amazon to Palo Alto Networks , on how internally deployed AI tools and agents are being used to improve productivity, customer experience, supply chains and potentially headcount. According to Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick, the main AI use cases from software companies seem to be on developer productivity, customer service and support, as well as seller efficiency — which refers to how a company's sales revenue compares to the resources they used. "While some teams have been more explicit about labor savings (~50% of companies that have discussed internal AI use have mentioned headcount rationalization), many have noted meaningful improvement in efficiency which over time should drive labor savings or at least hiring at a slower rate," Zelnick said in an Aug. He highlighted Palo Alto Networks , CrowdStrike , Shopify , Intuit and Microsoft as some standout names that are leveraging AI in ways he said "should support an ability to improve incremental margins." "If software companies are cutting/slowing headcount, we imagine it will be similar across industries and seat-based models will continue to be questioned even if they are able to price for the value they are creating near term," Zelnick added.

Article: EJ Antoni, United States President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that produces the nation’s jobs and inflation data, has been embroiled in criticism from economists. Antoni was chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an author of Project 2025, the far-right wish list the think tank created for then-candidate Trump – or the next Republican president. Make no mistake: This selection is a clear assault on independent analysis that will have far-reaching implications for the reliability of US economic data,” Alex Jaquez, a member of the White House National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Many former Labor Department officials say that while it is unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented. Antoni was nominated by Trump after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a jobs report on August 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency and the broad condemnation of experts. It is an attempt to mislead the American people, to avoid being held to account for their failures, and to rewrite history,” Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Antoni’s nomination comes as Trump continues to spin fabrications throughout the US economic data, including claiming gas prices are lower than they are and that egg prices have fallen 400 percent – a mathematically impossible figure. On August 4, a week before he was nominated, Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices. Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritises getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favour Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics, told The Associated Press. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; he called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15 percent. His argument that the US was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. Flawed data Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni’s concerns that the government’s jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. They don’t organise it.” Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Senator Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.

Article: The Trump administration recently told the Supreme Court that a California judge’s order put law enforcement in a “straitjacket.” But plaintiffs who won that lower court order have urged the high court to keep it in place, arguing that lifting it would bless an “immigration dragnet” ensnaring millions of people in the Los Angeles area — including U.S. citizens, would likely succeed in proving that the government is “conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.” For now, she said, the government can’t rely solely on any combination of the following four factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence at a particular location, like a day laborer pickup area; or one’s type of work. Solicitor General John Sauer turned to the Supreme Court for help in lifting the order, which he said “defies blackletter Fourth Amendment law, imposing a straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts that is inimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry that this Court’s precedents demand.” Opposing emergency high court relief, the plaintiffs countered that the judge’s order “broke no new legal ground,” and that it “does not prevent the government from enforcing the immigration laws, conducting consensual encounters, or relying on any or all of the four factors along with other facts to form reasonable suspicion.” They further wrote that the administration’s “extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District [of California] because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution.” The administration can file a final reply brief the justices, after which we will learn whether this will be the latest instance of the high court saving the administration from a lower court loss in President Donald Trump’s second term.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has unveiled his slate of picks for the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual awards show designed to honour actors, musicians, designers and creative professionals who have dedicated their lives to the performing arts. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on stage at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, one of the premier stages in Washington, DC, in a show of power over the national cultural institution. “ It’ll be something that people are going to be very proud of.” This year’s five honourees include disco singer Gloria Gaynor, country music musician George Strait, the rock band Kiss, British performer Michael Crawford and actor Sylvester Stallone, star of the classic films Rocky and Rambo. Do you believe what I have to do?” Wednesday’s announcement was Trump’s latest foray into the arts, as he seeks to reshape the US’s cultural institutions to reflect his agenda. But since returning to the White House for a second term in January, Trump has not only sought to make his presence known at the Kennedy Center, but he has sought to wield power over its programming. “I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” Trump wrote at the time. Trump also teased his new vision for the Kennedy Center Honors — and appeared to troll critics who expressed outrage over Republican proposals to rename the performing arts center after the Republican leader. “ In the coming months, we’ll fully renovate the dated and, really, the entire infrastructure of the building and make the Kennedy Center a crown jewel of American arts and culture once again,” he said. “ We have the right location, and soon we will be a crime-free area.” Earlier this week, Trump invoked the capital’s Home Rule Act to take control of the local police force and deployed members of the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, despite the fact that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low.

Article: What was less appreciated by some fans like myself, though, was the way the news was delivered: not through the star’s famously subtle clues and carefully planted Easter eggs, but via a direct, clear-cut statement on a popular podcast. The buzz began Monday when Taylor Nation, Swift’s management team, posted 12 photos of the musician on Instagram in orange outfits with the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” Later in the day, Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason teased “a VERY special guest” on their popular podcast “New Heights” with a silhouette fans quickly deduced to be Swift, in posts commented on by her label Republic Records, among others. And in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, the “New Heights” team confirmed the rumor by releasing a clip of the singer on the podcast, during which she took out a briefcase emblazoned with her initials and opened it to reveal a (cover-obscured) record. As a passionate and longtime Swiftie, I’m thrilled by the news, and I know I’ll be lapping up every shred of info about the album that’s delivered before its as-yet-unknown release date. Since Swift’s earliest days of success, much of her most important pieces of news — album drops, song titles, tour dates — have been revealed via elaborate Easter eggs that’ve often eluded casual fans but thrilled her most ardent supporters. It’s a fun challenge to spot and then decode the clues, which have ranged from nail polish in a music video signifying the color scheme of her then-next album “Lover” to a watch choker necklace set to 3:15, aka March 15, the date “The Eras Tour” film came out on Disney+. Since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. Even when we’ve wrongly assumed something benign is a purposeful hint and been proven otherwise (an act lovingly known as “clowning” in the Swiftiverse), the communal journey of overanalyzing details and positing theories — however far-fetched — has become a core part of the Swiftie fandom. And it hasn’t just bonded her followers; Swift herself has said that she feels her subtle messages “expand the experience” of audiences appreciating her art, and she has complimented eagle-eyed fans for their guesswork on numerous occasions. Prior to the 2019 release of “Lover,” for instance, fans spent days combing through her “ME!” music video to find the album and single titles after a hint from the star, even correctly predicting the day she officially announced the album based on a wax seal in a calendar sold on her site. Yet in the last few years, since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. After Tuesday’s album announcement, many fans revisited several details in her recent posts and outfits that now appear to have been clues about “Showgirl.” But regardless, the fact that the only actual information about the record released so far has come from Swift’s own mouth while sitting on one of the world’s most popular podcasts is quite telling, as is the lack of buildup time between Taylor Nation’s “See you next era” tease and the “New Heights” clip. I just hope that if I know any titles or lyrics in advance, it’ll be because I’ve had to search for them rather than getting them fed right to me.

Earlier this month, NATO started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said that it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($582 million). Sweden announced the following day that it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts.

Article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement is packing detainees into a holding area without beds, showers or medical support, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of detainees. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Conditions in the holding area in a federal building at 26 Federal Plaza became widely known after a video from inside the facility was released last month by the New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York ordered Tuesday that holding rooms must have at least 50 square feet per person, be cleaned three times a day and have a clean bedding mat for each detainee. Advertisement Advertisement Oestericher had argued in the hearing that the move wasn’t necessary because detainees are allowed to make a phone call when they arrive and their stays are short-term. The judge was unmoved, responding: “I think, at least preliminarily, we are going to have to agree to disagree about that.” Advertisement Attorney Heather Gregorio, who also represents the detainees, described the facility as having “inhumane and horrifying conditions.” She said the lawsuit includes eight accounts from people who had recently been held there. The lawsuit says that when an attorney tried to contact Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado — a New Jersey father of two who was taken into custody there Friday after a scheduled court appearance — the attorney “was refused access to his client” when he went to the facility. “An ICE agent responded that visitations are prohibited for individuals detained at 26 Fed, and that he could not call 26 Fed to set up a call with his client. He subsequently called the number listed on the ICE public website as the telephone to contact ICE at 26 Fed, but was not able to set up an attorney call with his client,” according to the lawsuit. They added that a detainee who had survived a stroke did not receive his medication, which led to “dangerously high blood pressure.” The processing area is composed of four ICE holding rooms that vary in square footage from 173 square feet to 820 square feet, said Nancy Zanello, assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to a court filing. McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said the 26 Federal Plaza facility serves as a processing center to briefly hold detainees before they may be transferred to a proper ICE detention center.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. "YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy," James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google - a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: BBC apologises after Jenrick accused of xenophobia 11 minutes ago Share Save Paul Glynn & Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save PA The BBC has apologised after a contributor to the Radio 4 Today programme's Thought for the Day slot accused shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick of "xenophobia". Theologian and author Dr Krish Kandiah used the term about an article in which Jenrick said he wouldn't want his daughters living near "men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom you know next to nothing". A BBC statement said that while Dr Kandiah's message was "broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion". The segment, which is broadcast during the Today programme but overseen by the BBC's religion department, features contributors from religious and theological backgrounds delivering messages related to topical themes and events. He quoted a line from the Conservative politican that said: "I certainly don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom we know next to nothing." Dr Kandiah continued: "These words echo a fear many have absorbed – fear of the stranger. However, over the past year, xenophobia has fuelled angry protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, deepening divisions in our communities." In response, Jenrick, who has three daughters aged 10, 12 and 14, posted: "On BBC Radio 4 this morning listeners were told that if you're concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you're racist. You're a good parent." A BBC spokesperson said: "While its reflection on fear in society from a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion." The BBC said it was apologising for the inclusion of an opinion in a place where it was inappropriate, not passing judgement on the rights or wrongs of the opinion.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated that there should be no peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war now in its fourth year without representation from his country, and also said Russia should face sanctions if it does not agree to an immediate ceasefire, following a virtual meeting between him, United States President Donald Trump and European leaders. Zelenskyy delivered the message after the call on Wednesday, two days ahead of a summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which comes as part of Washington’s so far failed attempts to end the war in Ukraine. “We’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself if they’d like to have me there.” The rapid developments came after Trump met virtually with Zelenskyy and other European leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron and the United Kingdom’s Keir Starmer on Wednesday. Arranged in a bid for Europe to try and influence Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday, this second call took place after talks earlier in the day between Zelenskyy, European leaders and the heads of NATO and the European Union. As the Russian army continues to make sizable territorial gains in the east Ukrainian province of Donetsk, Zelenskyy told the US president and his European colleagues that Putin was “bluffing” about pursuing peace. His choice of words, a term commonly used in reference to poker, evoked Trump telling Zelenskyy, “you don’t have the cards” in the infamously hostile news conference at the White House on February 28th. “Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.” After the Trump call, Merz, who described the meeting as “exceptionally constructive”, stressed that Ukraine is willing to negotiate, but noted that “legal recognition of Russian occupation is not up for debate”. They must also be able to count on Western aid in the long term.” After the online meeting, France’s Macron said Trump would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Putin on Friday. The Trump-Putin summit in Alaska has been a cause for anxiety in Kyiv and Europe more widely, after Trump declared that both Ukraine and Russia would have to swap land if a truce is to be reached. “I just talked to him [Trump] right before I came on the stage, and he said very simply that we are going to make it our mission as an administration to bring peace to Europe once again,” Vance said. Advertisement However, Vaessen noted that European leaders were still “concerned that everything changes as soon as President Trump is in that room with President Putin, who they know is a very keen, a very sharp negotiator”. On the battlefield, Russia has claimed to have captured the villages of Suvorovo and Nikanorovka as its gains in Donetsk continue, with the Ukrainian authorities issuing evacuation orders for around a dozen settlements.

Article: BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s president told a top Iranian security official Wednesday that Beirut rejects any foreign intervention in its internal affairs and wants Lebanon to remain stable and secure for the good of its people. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, is the most senior Iranian official to visit Beirut since the Lebanese government voted last week for a U.S.-backed plan to disarm the Iran-backed Hezbollah group by the end of the year and implement a ceasefire with Israel. The Mediterranean country has been under international pressure to get the militant group to lay down arms after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November. “Lebanon desires cooperation with Iran within the framework of sovereignty and friendship that are based on mutual respect,” President Joseph Aoun said in remarks released by his office after meeting Larijani. Larijani told reporters after meeting Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri that his country does not interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs, accusing the United States of “ordering” the Lebanese government to implement “a foreign plan.” The senior Iranian official also said his country rejected the plan and that any proposal to disarm Hezbollah should be part of an internal dialogue between the government and the Iran-backed group. At Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters greeted Larijani while chanting “death to America” and waving Iranian flags and the group’s yellow banners in a show of support for Tehran.

Article: BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland’s entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented. Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies. But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda. “The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. “There really is no precursor for this suit” WATCH: How Trump’s immigration policies are affecting caregivers and nursing homes Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case. “I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order. Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government. The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.” Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Article: "If the Fed cuts rates in September, this would greatly benefit small caps, as many small caps are levered to the economy and also financially," said Larry Tentarelli, founder of the Blue Chip Trend Report, who called small caps a "rate cut rotation" play. Small-cap stocks jumped on Wednesday, bucking the slide in some of the market's largest companies, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates starting in September — possibly boosting consumer spending and lowering the cost of capital. Interest rate futures traders are pricing in a nearly 100% likelihood that the central bank lowers the fed funds rate from its current 4.35% to 4.50% range at the September gathering, according to prices of 30-day futures on the CME that are calculated on its FedWatch tool. A growing chorus of economic and political voices have been pushing for rate cuts, especially after weaker-than-expected job growth in July, a downward revision to labor market growth in May and June, and this week's consumer inflation report that showed the headline come in cooler than expected. Trump and has allies have frequently attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell in recent months over the central bank's rate policy, urging the Federal Open Market Committee to ease monetary policy. "I think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September," Bessent said, adding that "any model" suggests "we should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower." One basis point equals 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%.

Needless to say, the makeup of both ETFs is completely different, so instead of wondering if both bullish patterns can be completed, we need to dig a little deeper to understand what needs to happen for both IWM and DIA to officially break out and extend higher. If it can, in fact, log a higher low and start developing bullish patterns, its 14-day RSI, now below 50, could finally climb into the upper half of the scale (50–70). While large-cap technology has driven most of the gains in the broader large-cap ETFs, two of the weakest performers within the DIA Dow Jones Industrial Average this year are actually large-cap tech names. The chart also shows that previous sharp selloffs — such as the one from late 2024 through April — have repeatedly found demand near the same uptrend line drawn from April 2021. If buyers step in here again — as they have before — CRM could regain momentum, which would positively influence the ETF and potentially help push it toward all-time highs. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

Article: SANTIAGO, Chile — What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with “false flight plan data.” Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile’s prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge’s ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was “relieved by the outcome.” For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility.

Article: DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladeshi anti-corruption officials testified in court on Wednesday against former British anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq, accusing her of using a family connection to the deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to obtain state-owned land in the South Asian country. Siddiq, who is Hasina’s niece, resigned from her post in Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s government in January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt and was named in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh. WATCH: Bangladesh faces political unrest and uncertainty a year after leader’s resignation Siddiq in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian recently referred to Bangladesh as “a foreign country” and called the charges against her “completely absurd.” She asserted to The Guardian she was “collateral damage” in the longstanding feud between her aunt and Bangladesh’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus. Separately, the anti-corruption investigation has alleged that Siddiq’s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.

Article: deployed two warships Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal where two Chinese ships collided earlier in the week while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident that raised alarms about maritime safety. The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. Navy has staged what it calls freedom-of-navigation voyages and overflights in the South China Sea for years to challenge China’s restrictions and its demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years. On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern “by the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard,” saying in a statement the incident “highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” “This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coast guard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the (anti-)collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.” Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500 feet (150 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coast guard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board.

Article: Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” degree programs will lose eligibility to participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program if they are determined to have “ low earning outcomes ” for undergraduates and graduates, starting in July 2026. A mother to five children of her own, Bourrage said she now earns about $40,000 each year, a salary that leaves her struggling to afford rent, groceries and other essentials. “The pay needs to be where we can live and be OK and not have to worry about how we’re taking care of our own children while we’re taking care of other people’s children,” Bourrage said. “If I had to pay for a class right now out of pocket, I wouldn’t take it.” The new federal loan rule says that if the median earnings of a program’s degree recipients remain below the earnings of a high school graduate for two out of the last three years before the education secretary makes a determination, students enrolled in that program would no longer be able to pay for it with federal loans. According to the most recent data from the College Board, the average estimated total cost of a four-year undergraduate degree earned at a public in-state college while attending classes full-time and on-campus is nearly $30,000. The White House said these new measures force colleges and universities to have “skin in the game” and reduce the risk of bloated student loan balances and the need for taxpayers to bail out loan recipients. But shutting off federal loans for these students could turn people away from the profession altogether, at a time when teachers are burnt out and leaving classrooms and daycares, Bourrage said. “We know how important those first five years of life are – the importance of the environment that these children are in,” said Amanda Quesenberry, an associate professor in the School of Teaching and Learning at Illinois State University. You’re babysitters.’ We’re so much more than that.” While low wages are a significant threat to the stability of the profession, experts are worried this move will simply worsen a growing child care crisis rather than change the economics of the industry for the better. WATCH: What the new student loan rules mean for current and future borrowers Yet early education workers earn far less than elementary or middle school teachers, with a national median wage of $13.07 per hour, according to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. After the COVID pandemic shook the industry and prompted a “huge dropoff” in care providers, the workforce in recent months has finally returned to what it was in February 2020, said Abby Copeman Petig, who is the center’s research director. “But it’s still not enough.” Surveys conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children have found that more than half of care administrators wish they could enroll more children in their programs, but high costs for parents or low compensation for qualified staff are barriers. WATCH: A look inside the pronatalism movement encouraging Americans to have more children To boost pay that recognizes the value early childhood educators offer developing minds, Reef said communities and caregivers have two options: “If you want to increase pay, you either increase the price for parents, or you work in a state with a wage supplement to boost wages.” For example, Louisiana, Nebraska and Colorado have offered refundable tax credits to people who work in child care. But as states are forced to grapple with federal cuts and balance their own budgets in the months ahead, Reef said the competition for dollars that could have supported workers will grow even tighter. Historically, the industry “has never been rewarded and recognized adequately for the work that it does and for the value it provides to communities,” said Daniel Hains from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. These economic realities have helped create a crisis at all levels of education, Quesenberry said, adding that it’s “crazy” that someone could finish a four-year degree owing significant debt “and only have a job that pays them $30,000 a year.” How will the new rule affect child care in the U.S.? On July 3, the day before Trump signed the bill into law, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators pushed back on the proposal to place more restrictions on access to federal student loans and other financial aid. Trump’s law seeks “to adhere to an arbitrary deadline with policy that could limit opportunity and access for low-income students seeking to pursue post-secondary education,” Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the organization, said in a written statement. Right now, Hains said, the industry is waiting to hear from the Department of Education about how to interpret this part of the law and what regulations need to be in place to make it enforceable. When her 11-year-old daughter said she wanted to become a teacher, Bourrage said her reaction was swift: “Girl, no, you don’t.” She did not feel good discouraging her child from joining her profession. Many of them work second jobs, she said, “because they can not live off of how much they make.” If access to financial aid, including federal student loans, is jeopardized and if early childhood education programs are cut, Bourrage worries about the long-term effects on communities and the country.

Article: At least 26 people drowned on Wednesday after two boats carrying nearly 100 migrants capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa, according to the Italian Coast Guard, which said search and rescue operations were still underway. The migrants had been making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean from Libya when the boats capsized, and 60 people were rescued at sea, said Filippo Ungaro, the Italian spokesman of UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency. Most of the survivors — 56 men and four women, the Italian Red Cross said — were taken to a migrant center on Lampedusa, where some told volunteers they had been traveling on two rickety boats. After one boat began to take on water, some of the migrants scrambled onto the other boat, which capsized as a result of the added weight, according to accounts told to the International Organization for Migration, another United Nations agency.

The company stands to do even better when considering identity security accounts for about 25% of enterprise security spending, according to Deutsche Bank. The analysts called CyberArk a "meaningful organic accelerant" to Palo Alto's already strong business and argued the stock underperforming the broader cyber sector by 15% year to date is "overblown."

Article: European leaders tentatively hopeful after call with Trump ahead of Putin summit Speaking to Trump had allowed him to "clarify his intentions" and gave the Europeans a chance to "express our expectations," Macron said. He also agreed that any territorial issues had to be decided with Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, and that security guarantees had to be part of the deal, according to France's Emmanuel Macron. European leaders appeared cautiously optimistic after holding a virtual meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday, two days before he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump and Vice-President JD Vance spoke to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Nato chief Mark Rutte. The Europeans have been sidelined from the hastily organised summit in Alaska and their phone call today was a last-ditch attempt to keep Ukraine's interests and the continent's security at the forefront of Trump's mind. Still, in their statements European leaders restated the need for Kyiv to be involved in any final decision – betraying an underlying nervousness that Putin could ultimately persuade Trump to concede Ukrainian land in exchange for a ceasefire. "It's most important thing that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia," said Poland's Donald Tusk, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the leaders had "made it clear that Ukraine must be at the table as soon as follow-up meetings take place". Since the US-Russia summit was announced last week, Trump has made several references to "land-swapping" between Kyiv and Moscow – sparking serious concerns in Ukraine and beyond that he could be preparing to give in to Putin's longstanding demand to seize large swathes of Ukrainian territory. In statements issued after the phone call with Trump, several European leaders said such guarantees had been mentioned and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that "real progress" had been made in that respect. Since the spring the UK and France have been spearheading efforts to create a so-called "Coalition of the Willing" - a group of nations who have pledged to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine. On Wednesday the group said it stood "ready to play an active role" including by deploying "a reassurance force once hostilities have ceased" - although the shape, composition and role of such a force is yet unclear.

This situation is a "complicated mix of employer/employee relations and the specificity of sport" in the words of Dan Chapman, the partner and head of employment and sports teams at Leathes Prior. "Contractually Newcastle are likely to be well within their rights to insist that Isak trains away from the first team and are absolutely entitled to hold him to his contract and reject any advances from Liverpool," the lawyer said. "For that reason, we often see that the so-called player power will be perceived to win out in the end, though Newcastle will be trying to ensure that, if they are going to end up selling the player, they absolutely maximise the value they receive. "They will also want Isak to recognise that if he did end up spending this season as no more than a fringe player, he would be harming his own value and, potentially, entering a World Cup year in less than ideal conditions. "Though legally Newcastle hold most of the cards here, in practical terms, the player in a situation like this will often believe he also maintains a very strong hand, and how these situations finally play out resembles a very high stakes game of poker."

Article: “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire said President Donald Trump is trying to “rewrite history” after The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is planning to conduct an extensive review of exhibitions, materials and operations at the Smithsonian Institution ahead of the nation’s 250th anniversary “to ensure the museums align with President Trump’s interpretation of American history.” “Let’s be blunt,” Lemire said Wednesday. “This is really bad and really, really dangerous.” “A nation needs to know its history, has to be honest about its history, to learn from it, to honor it — and also then to grow and improve for the present and future,” Lemire said. He added, “There’s no way that rewriting a history to fit one president’s vision is good for a nation’s health or good for a nation’s democracy.” Lemire noted that the museum had already “sanitized” one exhibit on Trump’s two impeachments, which he called the “first step to a sweeping revisiting of American history.” Earlier this month, the museum announced that mention of Trump’s two impeachments would be restored to an exhibit after intense criticism following its removal. The “Morning Joe” co-host also listed several other ways he said the Trump administration was trying to revise the country’s history, noting the restoration of Confederate monuments and the renaming of military bases for Confederate generals. And to rewash it, to sanitize it, to whitewash it, to not be honest about it — that’s not good.” You can watch Lemire’s full reaction to the administration’s move in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images The Inca Empire in South America, one of the most powerful pre-Columbian societies, was known for many innovations — such as the architecture of Machu Picchu, an extensive road network, and a system of terraces for agriculture. The Inca Empire is often cited as the rare exception to the general rule that empires must have a form of written expression, says Kit Lee, a research associate with the university, but this is only because "khipus get overlooked as a form of writing." These unusual recording devices are bunches of knots tied in long, colored cords. "Even today, in the Andes, when you participate in rituals, you have to drink what you are given." This hair analysis adds another piece of evidence to the growing belief that khipu production and literacy might have been more widespread in the Inca Empire than the Spanish colonizers assumed and recorded in their accounts. "Modern khipus tend to be made by lower-status people — hacienda workers, peasant laborers, herders," Lee says, explaining that modern khipus tend to have a different shape and structure from ancient ones. Sponsor Message Museums hold hundreds of khipus that have never been studied by specialists, he says, and this study is likely to inspire a re-look at ones that have been scrutinized before. "I would not not be surprised if we find other khipus with substantial amounts of human hair in them in the future," he says, and that hair might provide a way to understand khipu production in the Inca Empire that's distinct from the stories written down by colonizers, who may not have fully understood what was really going on. "We need to tell a story of literacy and of writing and of recordkeeping in the Inca Empire that is way more plural, that includes folks who have not been included in the standard narrative."

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand lawmaker who was thrown out of Parliament for calling her opponents spineless during a fiery debate about a Palestinian state was ejected again on Wednesday when she refused to apologize for the remark. Chlöe Swarbrick, co-leader of the left-leaning Green Party and part of the opposition bloc, was ordered to leave parliament on Tuesday over a speech in which she called for government lawmakers “with a spine” to endorse her proposal for New Zealand to impose sanctions on Israel over the war in Gaza. Her censure came amid fraught scenes in Parliament in Wellington on Tuesday as opponents rebuked the government for not moving to recognize an independent Palestinian state, days after neighboring Australia pledged to do so. Calling opponents spineless prompted the ejection The Green party lawmaker was abruptly ejected from the debating chamber when she urged government politicians to join her in a proposal to sanction Israel, which currently wouldn’t have enough votes to pass into law. WATCH: New Zealand’s rightward shift ignites mass protests from Indigenous Māori people The standoff resumed when Swarbrick took her seat again on Wednesday despite the ban and Brownlee asked again if she would apologize. Brownlee took the serious step, rare in New Zealand’s Parliament, of taking a vote to “name” Swarbrick for her misconduct, a ruling that means a legislator is formally suspended with their pay docked. On Wednesday, opposition politicians decried Swarbrick’s penalty as unusually severe, with lawmaker Willie Jackson highlighting his own ban of just 30 minutes for calling one of his colleagues a liar, before he was allowed to resume his seat without an apology. In London, more than 500 people were arrested Saturday when supporters of a pro-Palestinian group recently outlawed as a terrorist organization intentionally broke the law to test the British government’s ability to enforce the ban. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon Wednesday made his most strident rebuke yet of Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the Israel leader “has lost the plot” on the “human catastrophe” in Gaza. “He is not listening to the international community and that is unacceptable.” While senior New Zealand officials, including Luxon, have said recognition of Palestine from their government was “a matter of not if, but when,” his Cabinet has yet to endorse a change of position.

Article: What's different in Wednesday's session is that the gains are being driven by the unloved, down-and-out health-care sector thanks to bounce backs in UnitedHealth Group , Eli Lilly and many others. The level of confidence by the executive team — including CEO David Ricks and Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky — to buy stock after last week's nasty selloff on disappointing trial data gave us the confidence to upgrade our rating back to a buy-equivalent 1 rating. Our trading restrictions, which prohibit us from buying or selling stocks that Jim Cramer mentions on TV for the next 72 hours, kept us from repurchasing some of Lilly shares we sold much higher back in late July. The thing about the CoreWeave outlook is that it implies a significant fourth-quarter ramp, meaning capital expenditures in its final quarter of the year are expected to substantially increase from the pace seen over the first three.

Shane Daley, 40, was arrested and accused of "sending harassing and threatening voicemail messages to a family member of murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson," according to a statement by federal prosecutors in Albany. "In a series of voicemail messages, Daley used threatening and harassing language that focused on, among other things, Thompson’s killing, expressed satisfaction over the fact and manner of his death, and stated that the victim and Thompson’s children deserved to meet the same violent end," prosecutors said.

Article: With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the discussions. Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. In a sign of Democrats’ limited option, the GOP-led state Senate was still able to pass the plan this week because Senate Democrats couldn’t get their entire 11-member delegation to break quorum. So while it appears likely Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. The aide added that while it’s “hard” to strike a victorious message if Republicans ultimately enact the new maps, as expected, it’s incumbent on Democrats across the country to drive the point home. More than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers have been out of the state since the beginning of August, depriving state Republicans of the minimum number of lawmakers needed to consider legislation. Phil King, a Fort Worth-area Republican who helms the chamber’s special redistricting committee, said Tuesday before the Senate passed the plan that while his first objective for a new map is “that it be legal, the second objective is to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.” President Donald Trump has been similarly blunt, telling CNBC last week that his party is “entitled to five more seats.” Democrats have pointed to those comments to justify their decision to abscond, arguing that the plan is a naked power grab that will also harm the representation of minority communities. A new statement Wednesday revealed how Democrats are defining victory: “In keeping with our original promise to Texans, the First Called Special session will never make quorum again,” state Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu declared, before applauding how “blue states nationwide are mobilized and ready to act if Abbott moves forward.” “Texas House Democrats will issue our demands for a second special session on Friday. Republicans have pointed out that the state legislature has not been able to consider any legislation without enough Democrats present, including a relief package for the July 4 floods outside of San Antonio that killed 130 people. “But with each passing day, the political cost of your absence is rising, and it will be paid in full.” But Democrats have criticized Republicans for prioritizing the redistricting legislation. Texas Democratic strategist Luke Warford told NBC News in an interview shortly before the quorum break began that the true measure of success for Democrats will be about forcing Republicans to pay political consequences since they are in control of the legislature. “The job of Democrats is to tell the story to people about what is happening, about how craven the Republican actions are, and about how they are trying to rig the system,” said Warford, who started a group called the Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund to help fund the party’s ecosystem in the state.

Article: The settlement stems from allegations raised in both a 2024 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lawsuit and a separate class action that claims Capital One froze interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts at just 0.3% for years while offering much higher rates, up to 4.3%, on a newer account called the 360 Performance Savings. The first $300 million will be distributed as one-time, pro rata payments to all eligible current and former 360 Savings account holders, based on how much additional interest each person would have earned if their account had paid the higher 360 Performance Savings rate during the initial period. For a set period, Capital One must pay these account holders at least twice the national average savings rate, with the $125 million representing the extra interest compared to what they would have earned at the national average.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — "Yellowstone" and "Landman" creator Taylor Sheridan and Ross Perot Jr.'s real estate development company Hillwood are collaborating to launch what they're touting as Texas' largest film and TV production studio hub right here in DFW. Sheridan's SGS Studios, in collaboration with Paramount, and Hillwood announced Wednesday plans for a 450,000-square-foot TV and film production facility in the 27,000-acre AllianceTexas development in north Fort Worth near Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport. Hillwood and SGS Studios say it's just the start of a large TV and film production hub in the Alliance area with "several" additional campuses planned, "designed to anchor long-term industry growth and position Texas as one of the world’s premier destinations for content creation." "Landman" season 2, as well as Sheridan's "Yellowstone" spinoff "Rio Palo" have been filming around North Texas recently. Ross, Mike and the entire team at Hillwood are truly exceptional partners, and we are building something permanent that will be the centerpiece for one of the most state-of-the-art studios in the business.” Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal report that the development is happening after the Fort Worth City Council voted to nominate the site for film incentives from the state earlier this month. “Fort Worth is now the fourth largest city in Texas, and the film industry presents an exciting opportunity to fuel our growth while keeping our economy bold and diverse,” said Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker. “With Hillwood’s legacy of leadership in infrastructure development and innovation, it’s fitting that AllianceTexas serves as a hub for creative production with the addition of the new SGS production campus. This move is significant in showcasing what Fort Worth can offer to attract major productions that create jobs and foster continued industry growth.” Sheridan's also been heavily involved in advocating for increasing the funding the state invests in attracting film and TV productions to the state.

Article: Richard Kim, a former Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase executive, was indicted on securities and wire fraud charges related to his alleged misappropriation of about $4 million in investor funds for his start-up online casino company, most of which he allegedly lost within a week through gambling on another site, prosecutors said Wednesday. The case against Kim again relates to his company Zero Edge, which the 39-year-old New York resident announced after leaving Galaxy Digital in March 2024, and which purportedly planned to develop a blockchain and cryptocurrency-enabled gaming app. "After obtaining investors' funds, Kim misappropriated them by transferring them to personal accounts, where he made leveraged cryptocurrency trades and gambled away substantially all of the company's money," an indictment unsealed Tuesday in U.S. On Jun 29, 2024, the indictment says, Kim "admitted in an email to some investors that he was 'solely responsible for the loss of $3.67 [million] of the Company's balance sheet' following leverage trading losses from see found funding proceeds' and that the company had lost nearly all of its money." But in fact, Kim "concealed from the company's investors that he had misappropriated the funds and used them at an online casino, telling investors that he had lost the money because of a 'treasury management strategy' rather than personal gambling," the indictment says. The indictment says that Kim gambled on Shuffle, whose website says it is a "VIP Crypto Casino and Sportsbook." Zero Edge, which Kim incorporated in April 2024 in the Cayman Islands, never launched its casino. Since his arrest, judges have repeatedly extended a deadline that would have required prosecutors to either obtain a grand jury indictment of Kim or drop the charges after prosecutors told the judges they were discussing a possible resolution of the charges with Kim's defense lawyer. KIm reported his conduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2024, "claiming that he had been 'grossly negligent' in misusing company funds but that he 'had no fraudulent intent throughout' but rather 'gambled investor money away' because he had a gambling addiction," according to the complaint. Kim left Goldman in the spring of 2018 to join Galaxy Digital, a digital assets and data center infrastructure company founded by the early cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, who worked at Goldman in the 1990s. "Richard Kim misled investors by promising that he would build a blockchain-based casino gaming app, but ironically Kim turned around and gambled away the very funds he said he would use to build a better casino," Manhattan U.S. A Galaxy spokesman said, in a statement, "Richard Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment."

Article: To explain the downturn, executives have said that diners are "cautious," in the words of Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman, or dealing with an economic "fog," according to Cava CFO Tricia Tolivar. And just as diners are finding reasons why to cut back on their Shake Shack burgers or Chipotle bowls, investors are trimming their fast-casual holdings after rewarding the companies last year for outperforming the rest of the industry. More broadly, investors have grown more cautious about betting on any restaurants, given weak traffic trends and concerns about consumer spending, according to a research note on Sunday from UBS. "Through our regular consumer research, we hear concerns about elevated prices, future job prospects and general anxiety about the future," Wingstop CEO Michael Skipworth said on the company's earnings conference call in late July. On the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, Sweetgreen's Neman said that the chain saw "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April" — coinciding with the drop in consumer sentiment. To improve its value perception among customers, Sweetgreen is increasing its chicken and tofu portions by 25%, improving its chicken and salmon recipes and implementing some promotional pricing, like $13 menu bowl drops for its loyalty program members. Executives said that it faced difficult comparisons to the year-ago period's same-store sales growth of 14.4%, which was fueled by its own steak launch and strong demand at newer restaurant locations that waned this year.

Article: Protests and vigils have taken place around the world in support of Palestinians suffering in Gaza and to pay tribute to the four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers killed by Israel in the besieged enclave in a deliberate targeted assassination on Sunday. Journalists, students, activists and members of civil society – notably in Cape Town, South Africa; Manila, the Philippines; and London, the United Kingdom – held the protests on Wednesday to call on their governments to put pressure on Israel to allow international media into Gaza and bring an end to Israel’s genocidal war there. Late on Sunday, Al Jazeera correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, along with cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal, were killed in an Israeli strike that had targeted their media tent located by al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Sharif had been one of Gaza’s most recognisable faces for his constant reporting of the reality on the ground since Israel’s war on Gaza began following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. South Africa Members of civil society and journalists gathered at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town on Wednesday to express their anger at al-Sharif’s murder, sporting placards with one reading “your voice was louder than their bombs”. Advertisement The location is significant, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Cape Town, as “it’s been an important signal against oppression here in South Africa, especially during the decades of apartheid”. “People here are angry.” Journalist Zubeida Jaffer told Miller, “I was one of the journalists who were targeted, you know those media that documented apartheid, so this really resonates with me.” Miller said, “The South African government has previously condemned the killing of journalists in Gaza, specifically in 2022 when Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. The South African government had said it was a violation of international law.” Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American journalist who worked as a reporter for 25 years for Al Jazeera, before she was killed by Israeli forces while covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. United Kingdom Reporters belonging to the UK branches of the National Union of Journalists paid their respects on Wednesday to the slain Al Jazeera workers outside the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street, said Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from London. The reporters, holding placards bearing the names of journalists killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began, read out the names of each journalist that appeared on their placard and “symbolically, recited Islamic funeral prayers” for those killed on Sunday, said Hull. Those present “have really condemned the British government … talking about its complicity in what is going on in Gaza, for not doing more and speaking out more,” said Hull. While British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday “talked about his grave concern” about the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists, those present on Wednesday “want outright condemnation and nothing less”, said Hull. “They also want the government to take firm steps to pressure the Israeli government to ensure the safety of journalists in Gaza, importantly to allow international journalists into Gaza to be able to work freely there and for an independent investigation to be carried out by … the International Criminal Court in order to provide justice and accountability for those involved.” Advertisement Last week, Starmer condemned Israel’s plans to take over Gaza City, saying they were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”. He has also announced that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of a two-state solution. “They also describe the accusation that Anas al-Sharif, one of the most prominent voices reporting from within Gaza, is a member of Hamas is baseless,” said Lo, noting that protesters say “this is an age-old tactic used by governments who are bent on silencing the truth”. These protesters also gathered to urge “the international community to ramp up pressure on Israel to stop its genocide, including for the Philippine government to cut its trade and defence ties with Israel”, said Lo.

Article: “Now we’ve got sales slowing because [the pre-tariff buying] surge pretty much pulled ahead a lot of people that might have been in the market this year, who wanted to buy before tariffs hit,” Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Al Jazeera. “If consumers don’t have the resilience to pay for those higher prices, they’ll take a step back.” United States President Donald Trump’s erratic approach to tariffs, putting some in place and then taking them away, has made it difficult for businesses to plan. In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. “The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera. EVs hit hard Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall. The payback period will be longer.” Manufacturing strains While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.

Article: Although her condition forced her to spend most of her childhood at a nursing home, she has resided in her own home for years with the help of personal assistants she hires under a New York State Medicaid program. “But it’s hard when you have to tell your new hires, ‘I can’t guarantee you’re going to get paid on time or get the appropriate amount of hours.’” Christian is not the only one affected by the state program’s recent takeover. NBC News spoke with nine consumers and personal assistants who described multiple problems since Public Partnerships LLC (PPL) won the $1 billion, five-year contract in 2024, replacing roughly 600 entities that had been administering the program. Its takeover as the program’s sole administrator triggered an avalanche of complaints from consumers unable to reach anyone to answer questions and assistants unpaid for hours they worked and unhappy with reduced health insurance benefits, according to lawmakers, consumer advocates and the consumers and assistants interviewed by NBC News. Amanda Lothrop, chief operating officer for New York State’s Medicaid program, told NBC News that the transition to PPL aimed to eliminate the former program’s administrative inefficiencies while protecting taxpayers. In response to questions from NBC News, PPL and the New York state health department said together they had identified 30 instances of home care workers under the previous system billing consumers who were hospitalized or dead, five cases of workers billing for work with consumers who were out of the country, one worker claiming to work for two people at the same time and another who claimed to be in two places simultaneously. “In partnership with PPL,” the department of health said in a statement, it “is using enhanced data and monitoring tools to protect program integrity, support consumers, and take timely action when issues arise.” Meg Fitzgerald, a PPL spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company’s “systems and centralized control processes would have been able to identify and prevent these violations.” The contract New York State awarded to PPL is a recent example of private equity’s increasing involvement in home health care, said Aditi Sen, managing director of research and campaigns at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that advocates for fairness in the U.S. Last month, Sen published a report detailing the industry’s forays into home health care entitled, “Wall Street on Your Doorstep: Protecting Home Care from Private Equity Abuses.” “The private equity industry is looking for any streams of steady public funding,” Sen said in an interview. “As advocates have secured more funding for home and community-based services, that has resulted in the private equity encroachment.” She said the next step for researchers is to analyze the quality of home care after private equity gets involved. Founded in 1999, PPL calls itself an industry leader “in financial management services for consumer direction, serving consumers throughout the U.S.” As for the difficulties in the New York program, the PPL spokeswoman said in a statement: “The transition to a single fiscal intermediary required a significant element of education and, in some cases, a change in practices for submitting and approving time. Ultimately, we strive to provide the accountability this program deserves.” Three CEOs in five years Private equity firms have taken over wide swaths of the health care industry in recent years and ill effects on care have been well-documented in independent academic research. PPL’s website does not identify its owners, but a recent court ruling disclosed the two private equity firms that control it — DW Healthcare Partners of Toronto and Park City, UT, and Linden Capital Partners of Chicago. In a lawsuit filed last year against New York’s Department of Health by a home care company over the transition to PPL, the company’s private equity owners were identified in a document that PPL requested the judge keep under seal. If the information were made public, the company argued, it “may put individuals in danger and/or allow them to become targets of violence.” Public disclosure would also increase the risk of “unwanted attention and harassment,” PPL said. The rule mandated that at least 80% of Medicaid payments go to compensation for direct care workers, such as personal assistants, not a company’s “administrative overhead or profit.” Fitzgerald said the company’s objections were not about worker compensation. Rather, she said, the company believed the rule would “make it more difficult for states to initiate new self-directed programs and to maintain small self-directed programs.” Participants in the CDPAP program aren’t the only ones experiencing upheaval in the transition to PPL. “I uploaded them nine times before they were finally accepted in their system.” Murphy’s hourly pay with PPL was 2% less than she had previously earned, she said, and she never received the correct pay under the new program. “Last year, when it was pushed upon us in the budget process I said back then that I thought it was a bad idea,” Rivera said of the switch to PPL. “Unfortunately, what I heard from my constituents is the transition was indeed bungled.” Meanwhile, Christian, the Buffalo mom who has lost five personal assistants since PPL took over, is especially worried about how it might impact her daughter.

Article: If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court. Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said. Advertisement In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers. Advertisement Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.” Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants. Advertisement The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.” Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions. The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.” California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law. “We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues. Advertisement The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out. Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities. “But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country. “The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote. In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it. They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.” The judge presiding over the case has yet to rule on the preliminary injunction.

NBC News reported: President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would host this year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, his latest move to revamp the Washington, D.C., cultural institution in his image. He didn’t explain who “they” might be, but Trump appointed himself chair of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees earlier this year, and he started naming loyalists to leadership roles at the institution while purging its traditionally bipartisan board. To hear the Republican tell it, he has maintained a hands-on role, personally rejecting prospective Kennedy Center honorees whom he considered “wokesters.” As for this year’s Kennedy Center honorees, the list includes singer George Strait, actor and comedian Michael Crawford, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor and the band Kiss. So to review, the sitting American president, who presumably has a day job that keeps him rather busy, has found time to lead the Kennedy Center, personally scrutinize prospective honorees, agree to host the center’s upcoming awards ceremony and approve an honor for one of his pals.

Article: ROME (AP) — A boat carrying nearly 100 migrants capsized Wednesday in international waters off the Italian island of Lampedusa, killing at least 26 people and leaving about a dozen missing, the Italian coast guard and U.N. The coast guard said in a statement that the death toll stood at 26, but was still “provisional and being updated.” Based on survivor accounts, about 95 migrants left Libya on two boats, International Organization for Migration spokesperson Flavio Di Giacomo said. Lampedusa Mayor Filippo Mannino said that the shipwreck happened “presumably at dawn.” So far this year, 675 migrants have died making the perilous central Mediterranean crossing, not counting the latest sinking, according to the U.N. READ MORE: At least 68 African migrants killed after boat capsizes off Yemen, UN says The migration route from northern Africa to southern Europe is considered one of the most dangerous in the world, with almost 24,500 people dying or disappearing on the Mediterranean crossing in the past decade, according to the IOM. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni — who made combating illegal immigration a top priority of her right-wing government — pledged on Wednesday to continue fighting “unscrupulous traffickers” by preventing irregular departures and managing migration flows. “That today’s tragedy occurred despite a ready and operational international response warns us that the necessary rescue effort is not sufficient and, above all, does not address the root causes of this tragic problem,” Meloni said in a statement.

Article: government’s ethics watchdog agency warned this week that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has failed to comply with an agreement that required him to divest his financial assets, posing potential conflicts of interest as he leads the Trump administration’s economic policy agenda. Bessent, who was formerly the top investor for the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros, said that he would do so to “avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest.” Cabinet officials are required to shed certain holdings and investments within 90 days of being confirmed to avoid the potential for conflicts of interest. Trump has pushed the boundaries of traditional government ethics norms by publicly pushing his business interests, and top Trump administration officials have reached unusual ethics agreements that have allowed them to oversee government matters that involve former lobbying clients or could benefit family members.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission voted unanimously in favor of the plan during a meeting that drew 168 people for a public hearing in the Panhandle town of Havana, with both supporters and opposents present. Opponents called the hunt cruel, unnecessary and an excuse for hunters to bag a trophy animal when the real issue is the encroaching human population in bear habitat as Florida continues to grow. “Right now, too many of our residents see bears as threats and pests.” There has been only one documented fatal black bear attack in Florida, the May mauling of 89-year-old Robert Markel and his daughter's dog in a rural part of Collier County, in southwest Florida.

The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge. Because it’s starting to be a lost aesthetic.” He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay — a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan — where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023. And I’d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.” Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist.

Article: Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and another possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case Weinstein could be sentenced next month, if no retrial on unresolved rape charge Harvey Weinstein appears in state court in Manhattan after a mistrial on a rape charge, Wednesday, Aug. (Steven Hirsch /New York Post via AP, Pool) NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and a possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case, but when they’ll happen — and whether he’ll be back in front of another jury — is still up in the air. At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn’t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013. Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they’re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he’d prefer a trial at “the earliest the court can accommodate us.” Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall. If a fall trial happens, it would likely put Weinstein’s high-profile #MeToo case back in court as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in the final throes of his reelection bid. Bragg, a first-term Democrat who made prosecuting sex crimes cases a priority, has expressed satisfaction with Weinstein's conviction on a criminal sex act charge in the Haley assault and has been resolute in wanting the Oscar-winning studio boss retried on the Mann rape charge. “This work, first and foremost, is about the survivors and that’s why we’re prepared to go forward.” Aidala told reporters outside court that, in his view, it’s on prosecutors to resolve the rape charge — either by dropping it and clearing the way for sentencing, or promptly taking it to trial again. The “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love” producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn’t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.

Article: Spencer Platt | Getty Images Goldman Sachs is taking the heat for its call that heavier tariff-induced consumer inflation is ahead, but it's far from alone in that view among its Wall Street brethren. "There is considerable uncertainty around the degree of pass-through to consumer prices, given that this year's tariff increases are well larger than anything in the post-war US experience." President Donald Trump lambasted Goldman Sachs on Tuesday for research the firm's economists released over the weekend asserting that consumers will take on a significantly stronger hit from tariffs through the end of the year. Inflation to creep higher Most see at least a steady grind higher in prices as tariff clarity emerges and what looks to be effective rates around 18% — compared with around 3% at the start of the year — take root, with some caveats. "We expect inflation to continue on a gradual upward trend as businesses pass along their higher costs, but slowing shelter inflation and push-back from increasingly stretched consumers should help offset some of the tariff impact." To be sure, no one is calling for runaway inflation — more like monthly gains of 0.3%-0.5%. Moreover, whatever the acceleration ends up being, it's not expected to dissuade the Fed from starting to lower interest rates after staying on the sidelines through all of 2025 so far. JPMorgan sees the hit to gross domestic product, two-thirds of which comes from consumption, at "a bit under 1%." The Blue Chip Economic Indicators report for August, which surveys the leading economic names on Wall Street, sees GDP growth averaging just 0.85% in the second half of this year. But that's actually better than the 0.75% forecast from July as some of the most pessimistic forecasters changed their outlooks on the view "that the constraining effect of tariffs is expected to be temporary, as projected growth improves considerably next year," the August report said.

Article: Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens. As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. Khames Alrefi / Anadolu via Getty Images Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request to comment on the incident, but at the time it told the BBC that early in the day it had "identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops" and "fired warning shots." It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired "hundreds of meters away" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West." He added, “I would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.” Polling before Oct. The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. “Despite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,” said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor’s chair at the University of California, Berkeley. Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the “Black September” civil war in 1970, leading to the militants’ eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon. The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country’s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target “Palestinian terrorists.” More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas. “The Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,” Crocker told NBC News. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.

During ABC13's Share Your School Supplies Drive 2025, people from across the Houston area, and really, southeast Texas, pulled together to raise money and collect supplies for teachers, and ultimately, students. HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The community has once again shown that it supports its teachers like no other through the 2025 Share Your School Supplies Drive, benefiting the Houston Food Bank's School Programs. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring "If you want to be educated right, you need the right resources." Here's how the community stepped up for teachers in Spring during Share Your School Supplies. We believe that we have to give back to our educators, our stations, and other organizations that helped build the community the way it is." Volunteers of all ages and across the city also recognized just how large of an impact these school supplies can make. "I think it's really important to be donating school supplies because if you want to be educated right, you need the right resources to be going to school every day, going to college every day," one Texas A &M University student helping at the Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring told ABC13. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Sugar Land Sugar Land was one of five areas where the community showed up and showed out to make sure area teachers have what they need. "We may have a child that may come and needs some supplies, and it'll be there for them, so it just helps us to continue to help our young people." Nivens said that with a ban now on digital devices, some of the most-needed supplies included pens and paper as well as hand sanitizer, folders, and tissue. Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites on Friday, Aug. "Our employees are passionate about education, and anything we can do to support students and teachers in our community, we want to be able to do, so here they are handing out school supplies and wanting to be engaged in this event," said Vickie Yakunin, head of community engagement at Amazon. "This helps build the confidence as well in the children, so we're trying to alleviate that sacrifice from teachers who are pulling out of their own pockets to do so." "We want to be there for the children to help instead," Rascon added. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

Article: Despite being American citizens, three children — a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl — were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families. The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms. “The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States. “This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News. “Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.” McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.” NBC News has previously reported on U.S. Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.” Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states. Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras. “When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.” DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Article: Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has signed into law a controversial piece of legislation that would shield the military, police and other government-sanctioned forces from prosecution for human rights abuses committed during the country’s decades-long internal conflict. On Wednesday, Boluarte held a signing ceremony at the presidential palace in Lima, where she defended the amnesty law as a means of honouring the sacrifices made by government forces. “It brings justice and honour to those who stood up to terrorism.” But human rights groups and international observers have condemned the bill as a violation of international law — not to mention a denial of justice for the thousands of survivors who lived through the conflict. In the case of the current amnesty law, nine UN experts issued a joint letter in July condemning its passage as a “clear breach of [Peru’s] obligations under international law”. But at Wednesday’s signing ceremony, President Boluarte reiterated her position that such international criticism was a violation of her country’s sovereignty and that she would not adhere to the Inter-American Court’s decision. Drawing from Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, the human rights group Amnesty International estimates that the country’s armed forces and police were responsible for 37 percent of the deaths and disappearances that happened during the conflict.

Article: Six reputed members and associates of the Hoover Criminal Gang were arrested Wednesday in what authorities called the first major takedown of a sex trafficking operation in the Figueroa Corridor of South Los Angeles. The Hoovers largely controlled sex trafficking and prostitution along a 3.5-mile stretch of Figueroa Street between approximately Slauson Avenue and Century Boulevard from February 2021 to August 2025, according to a 155-page federal indictment charging 11 people. Advertisement Victims were recruited through false promises of a luxurious lifestyle, intimidation, and actual or threatened violence and were plied with drugs ranging from the synthetic painkiller oxycodone to amphetamines, according to the indictment. Indicted alongside Armstead were Kenyondre Young, 22; Naziz Harris, 19; Derail Robinson, 22; Jalon Phillips, 22; Bryan Isrel, 31, Tejohn Gray, 25; and Tommy Crockham, 30, — all from South L.A. Advertisement Along with the RICO charge, the defendants are facing various other charges, including sex trafficking of minors; sex trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion; transportation of a minor for sex trafficking; sexual exploitation of a child; drug trafficking conspiracy; money laundering to promote specified unlawful activity; and conspiracy to straw purchase firearms. Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in L.A., called the operation “the first step in returning the Figueroa Corridor — long known as prostitution haven — back to its residents who have suffered for too long while criminals were allowed to run amok.” Advertisement “There are no meaningful consequences for their conduct under state law, so the federal government — aided by its local law enforcement partners — will step in to make sure these criminals face lengthy prison sentences,” Essayli said in a news release. Gang members and associates allegedly acted as pimps “by managing and monitoring their victims, pooling resources to rent several motel rooms for commercial sex dates … and sending each other money via Cash App and Apple Pay,” according to the U.S. Prosecutors said sex workers were required to have their hair and nails done at all times “because their grooming was a status symbol that reflected on her pimp.” Advertisement Victims were also branded with tattoos of a defendant’s moniker, according to the indictment. In one case in April 2022, Gray and two accomplices drove to an area of San Bernardino notorious for prostitution activities and allegedly attempted to force two women into their car. In April 2024, according to the indictment, Armstead and Evans allegedly rented rooms at the Stadium Inn, a South Los Angeles motel, including one in which a 14-year-old girl was sex trafficked for at least three consecutive days. Gang members also allegedly posted videos and photographs of their assaults on others to social media, “in order to intimidate their victims and ensure their compliance in performing commercial sex work for the enrichment of their pimps and the Hoover gang itself.” If convicted, some defendants would face a minimum of 15 years and potentially up to life in federal prison.

Article: Last month, I wrote about how the Trump administration’s deep cuts to the State Department budget and workforce had delayed a congressionally authorized annual report that the State Department compiles on international human rights. As NBC News noted, the report is a tenth as long as last year’s report and has already been condemned by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In a departure from previous reports, the Trumpified version completely omits sections dedicated to abuses against women and LGBTQ people, while criticizing “free speech” abuses by countries like Brazil and members of the European Union for attempting to curb the spread of far-right disinformation and hate speech. In the case of Brazil, the report also says the country’s judiciary has unfairly oppressed followers of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who is under house arrest while he is on trial on charges of plotting a coup (a charge he denies). For example, despite extensive documentation of human rights abuses by El Salvador’s MAGA-aligned, self-described dictator Nayib Bukele, the State Department claimed to find no “significant” abuses in the country to which the Trump administration renditioned several hundred immigrants. In its section on Israel, West Bank and Gaza, the report lists under the category “War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, and Evidence of Acts that May Constitute Genocide, or Conflict-related Abuses” only the following: “Terrorist organizations Hamas and Hizballah continue to engage in the indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians in violation of the law of armed conflict.” The report makes no reference to Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza or to tactics that some international groups have gone so far as to label genocide. Here’s how State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the revised report, according to NBC News: ‘The Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,’ Bruce said. I tend to think the statement given to NBC News last week by an unnamed department official ahead of the report’s release is a bit more apt, if not honest: ‘We call out certain abuses that we think deserve highlighting, but just because we focus on one instance does not mean that we are not aware of other instances of human rights abuses,’ the official added, noting that all 198 countries and territories were listed in the reports. So given the opportunity to call out human rights abuses, like those that target women and LGBTQ people, where it knows they exist, this administration seems to prefer to misuse this report to point to policies and places that don’t align with its right-wing ideology.

She said that it was a hopeful sign for Democrats, and that the frustration should make it easier for the party to raise money and “recruit legitimate challengers in some of these districts.” Menendez urged the party to seize the opportunity ahead of the midterm elections: “The fact that there is energy and there is a built-in narrative, which Democrats are now figuring out how to make cohesive, begins to set the stage for those midterms, no matter how far away they are.” You can watch Sanders Townsend and Menendez’s analysis in the clip at the top of the page.

READ MORE: Floodwaters from Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau break record levels and prompt evacuations A search was also ongoing Wednesday for a man who walked through a flooded road in Chattanooga on Tuesday night but hadn’t been seen since, Maxwell said. Troy Plemons, a communications systems technician for EPB, Chattanooga’s electricity and telecommunications utility, said he was stuck in traffic on an interstate in his bucket truck for two to three hours on Tuesday evening when the area started to flood quickly. Then Plemons said he saw the water pick up an SUV, and when he and two Lawson Electric workers encouraged a woman inside to get out, she threw up her hands like she didn’t know if she could. “I tried my best.” Plemons said the water was reaching neck level for the woman in the SUV when he used a boring bit offered by the Lawson Electric workers to break the window and helped the woman get out. “I was doing everything I could to get her out because the water was rising pretty quick.” He helped the woman to the road and she sat down in his vehicle to warm up for a while. There were several rescues of people whose cars were overwhelmed by water in the area until the water receded about two to three hours later and traffic began to move again, Plemons said. “I’m thankful I was there to help that lady.” The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of middle Tennessee through Wednesday night, warning of scattered flash flooding with tropical-like heavy rainfall and the possibility of training storms, especially over already saturated areas. The airport in Chattanooga recorded more than 6.4 inches (about 16 centimeters) of rain Tuesday, marking the second-wettest day recorded for the city dating back to 1879, according to a social media post by the National Weather Service in Morristown.

In recent months, Lebanon’s new government has faced mounting pressure from the United States and Gulf states to complete the group’s disarmament, a key step mandated by the cease-fire agreement reached in November.

Shane Daley, 40, is accused of placing multiple calls to Thompson's family member after the shooting, justifying the killing and saying that the person deserved to die in a similar manner, according to a criminal complaint. Daley, as alleged, gleefully welcomed this tragedy and did all that he could to increase the Thompson family’s pain and suffering."

Article: WASHINGTON — Billy Joel's beloved Long Island motorcycle shop is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes. The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay, New York, in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge. Because it’s starting to be a lost aesthetic.” He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay — a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan — where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023. And I’d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.” Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist.

Article: Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that grant recipients challenging the freeze did not meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction restoring the flow of money. WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can suspend or terminate billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated funding for foreign aid. “The parties also dispute the scope of the district court’s remedy but we need not resolve it … because the grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,” Henderson wrote. “The majority opinion thus misconstrues the separation-of-powers claim brought by the grantees, misapplies precedent, and allows Executive Branch officials to evade judicial review of constitutionally impermissible actions.” The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for USAID to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs.

Article: A weak jobs report earlier this month revealed a sharp slowdown of the labor market, which could prompt the Fed to reduce borrowing costs as a means of warding off an economic slowdown, even if it opens up the possibility of higher inflation. Employers added an average of about 35,000 jobs over three months ending in July, which marks a major slowdown from roughly 128,000 jobs added monthly over the prior three months, the U.S. "The Fed will probably choose to make a cut in response." Economists acknowledged that tariff-induced inflation effects could lag behind the onset of the policy, giving policymakers a misguided sense of comfort with price levels. "It’s just coupled with a relatively worsening labor market." President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura/Reuters Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly urged the central bank to lower interest rates, saying the policy would boost economic performance and reduce interest payments on government debt. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate," Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, referring to the Fed chair, just hours after the favorable inflation report. "The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." In recent weeks, Trump has also slammed Powell, citing cost overruns tied to the central bank’s $2.5 billion building renovation project. The Fed attributes spending overruns to unforeseen cost increases, saying that its building renovation will ultimately "reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations," according to the central bank's website. Some analysts said central bankers may lean toward a rate cut in part due to Trump’s urgings, while others said the Fed would make its decision based solely on economic data. Political independence, Powell said last month, gives central bankers the "ability to make these very challenging decisions in ways that are focused on the data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks – and not on political factors."

Article: A federal judge has ordered Ohio State University to resolve via mediation the remaining lawsuits filed by former students who claim it failed to protect them from a sexual predator on the school payroll. “Yet it is today’s Ohio State that must reckon with the consequences of that ugly past in these cases.” If the case went to trial and the accusers won, it would be a “pyrrhic” victory, Watson wrote. “The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education, is through a mutual resolution short of a trial,” the judge wrote. Watson, in his order, referred the cases to Layn Phillips, a former Oklahoma federal judge who mediated the lawsuits filed against Michigan State by some 200 women athletes who were sexually abused by sports doctor Larry Nasser. 27, 2026 to provide the court with a progress report “at which point the Court will consider whether additional mediation would be productive.” In the meantime, lawyers for OSU and the plaintiffs will be allowed to continue taking depositions from witnesses. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News last month. He was deposed about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called “Surviving Ohio State,” in which one of the wrestlers he once coached called him a liar. A spokesperson for Ohio State, Benjamin Johnson, also declined to comment, saying via email, “We don’t typically comment on pending litigation." Ohio State found itself under fire in 2018 after a whistleblowing former wrestler named Mike DiSabato went public with allegations that Strauss had sexually abused him and hundreds of other athletes and that the school knew about it but did nothing to stop him. An independent investigation sponsored by Ohio State and conducted by the Perkins Coie law firm concluded in May 2019 that Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male athletes and students and that coaches and administrators knew about it for two decades but failed to stop him. Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized “to each person who endured” abuse at the hands of Strauss.

Article: The two-to-one ruling on Wednesday overturned a previous injunction that required the Department of State to resume the payments, including about $4bn for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and $6bn for HIV and AIDS programmes. However, the panel’s third judge — Florence Pan, nominated under former President Joe Biden — issued a dissenting opinion that argued Trump should not be allowed to violate the separation of powers by cutting the aid. “The court’s acquiescence in and facilitation of the Executive’s unlawful behaviour derails the carefully crafted system of checked and balanced power that serves as the greatest security against tyranny — the accumulation of excessive authority in a single Branch,” Pan wrote in her opinion. Republicans, however, control both houses of Congress, and in July, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 2025, allowing the government to claw back nearly $9bn in foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. US District Judge Amir Ali previously ruled that the Trump administration must pay its agreed-upon funds to humanitarian groups and other contractors that partnered with the government to distribute aid.

Article: President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he will seek more permanent federal control of the Washington, D.C., police force as he continues his efforts to ramp-up crime enforcement in the nation's capital. Earlier this week, Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops in the nation's capital, declaring a public safety emergency in order to put the Washington police department under federal control and station the National Guard on the city's streets. Asked Wednesday whether he'd work with Congress to extend the emergency authorization allowing him to seize temporary control of local law enforcement, Trump said he'll ask Congress for a "long-term" extension of federal control of the Washington police force. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images "We're going to be asking for extensions on that -- long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days," Trump said at an event at the Kennedy Center Wednesday afternoon. Trump has long threatened to take control of Washington, saying he wants to crack down on violent crime in the District although police statistics show that in the past two years, violent crime has fallen dramatically.

It’s likewise fair for Trump to press each side to compromise, and many Ukrainians seem ready to make concessions: More than two-thirds said in a Gallup poll that they favor a speedy negotiated end to the war, rather than fighting on until victory.

The White House said the review is aimed at portraying a more uplifting view of American history, but the administration has not specified who would be involved in evaluating the Smithsonian content. The White House did say the review would involve collaboration among museum staff, administration officials and personnel from other agencies, though it did not say what those other agencies are. Trump has been at odds with historians since his first term, when many criticized his push to promote what he sees as “patriotic history.” Early in his second term, he stirred deep alarm when he issued an executive order, titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which criticized what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” That order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” It directed Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to take action to redirect it toward promoting “American greatness.”

In July, when Trump first announced the plan, Robert Perosa, president of industry trade group Brazilian Beef Exporters Associations (ABIEC), said that the tariffs would make it “economically unfeasible” to continue to export to the US market. Advertisement Trump has directly tied the 50 percent tariff on many imported Brazilian goods to the judicial situation of his embattled ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest. In late July, the White House said that the order to impose this rate of tariffs is because of “the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil”.

The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that "reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive." Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately.

Article: In the hours that followed, they stole two more vehicles before ending up in a Chevrolet Silverado under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights, shielded from the police and TV helicopters overhead. (ONSCENE TV) Advertisement Over the years, pursuit suspects have tried to evade police by driving into parking garages or into Los Angeles International Airport, where there are flight restrictions for news choppers, or trying to run for it. A 2017 Los Angeles County civil grand jury report studied 421 police pursuits in the county that were reported to the California Highway Patrol and found that suspects were immediately apprehended in 67% of the chases, leaving 139 pursuits that did not end in an arrest. In the case of the Sunday chase, police are processing forensics from the stolen vehicles including a loaded gun discovered to see if that can link them to the suspects. They drove the truck which had “Got Milk” signs displayed on the mud flaps along the 5 freeway and 101 freeway through Studio City, Hollywood and downtown and at times went onto surface streets. “They go through the aqueducts or other exits and someone could be waiting for them,” Obayashi said, adding that police often don’t have time to react and set up a perimeter.

Article: Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in waterways through flooding, creating ideal conditions for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike. According to the Minnesota State Health Department, infections are mainly discovered during the summer months of July, August and September because hot weather means higher water temperatures and lower water levels. Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from the amoeba. States monitor waterways during summer months Louisiana, which has numerous warm and shallow waterways because of its proximity to the gulf and marshy terrain, has had numerous reports over the past decade where health officials found samples of Naegleria fowleri in the state's public water systems.

Article: 'Our children are dying' - rare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan city 19 minutes ago Share Save Barbara Plett Usher Africa correspondent, BBC News Share Save Watch: BBC obtains rare video from inside besieged el-Fasher in Sudan The women at the community kitchen in the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher are sitting in huddles of desperation. Our suffering is worse than what you can imagine." Food is so scarce in el-Fasher that prices have soared to the point where money that used to cover a week's worth of meals can now buy only one. This may be the only meal these children get for a day The hunger crisis is compounded by a surge of cholera sweeping through the squalid camps of those displaced by the fighting, which escalated this week into one of the most intense RSF attacks on the city yet. The paramilitaries tightened their 14-month blockade after losing control of the capital Khartoum earlier this year, and stepped up their battle for el-Fasher, the last foothold of the armed forces in Darfur. The UN has amplified its appeal for a humanitarian pause to allow food convoys into the city, with its Sudan envoy Sheldon Yett once more demanding this week that the warring sides observe their obligations under international law. "We have many malnourished children admitted in hospital but unfortunately there is no single sachet of [therapeutic food]," says Dr Ibrahim Abdullah Khater, a paediatrician at the Al Saudi Hospital, noting that the five severely malnourished children currently in the ward also have medical complications. Unfortunately, the international community is just watching." International non-governmental organisations working in Sudan issued an urgent statement this week declaring that "sustained attacks, obstruction of aid and targeting of critical infrastructure demonstrate a deliberate strategy to break the civilian population through hunger, fear, and exhaustion". Makeshift centres have been built to treat patients who have cholera Unlike el-Fasher, in Tawila aid workers at least have access, but their supplies are limited, says John Joseph Ocheibi, the on-site project coordinator for a group called The Alliance for International Medical Action. "We are mobilizing resources to see how best we can be able to respond." Sylvain Penicaud of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) estimates there are only three litres of water per person per day in the camps, which, he says, is "way below the basic need, and forces people to get water from contaminated sources".

Article: There’s a “public safety crisis” and “public safety emergency” in the District of Columbia, the Republican claimed, which is reflected in crime in the nation’s capital that is “rising” and “out of control.” As is often the case with this White House, reality quickly got in the way of the partisan talking points. initiative, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller — who recently made headlines for peddling weird claims about immigrant crime in Minneapolis — published an item to social media that read: Crime stats in big blue cities are fake. The falsehood-per-sentence ratio in this little missive was, in a rather literal sense, 1:1, though it is interesting to see Team Trump add crime statistics to its list of “fake” things, joining U.S. What’s more, let’s not forget that the FBI’s controversial director appeared at the president’s press conference on Monday, when Patel boasted from the White House podium, “The murder rates are plummeting. history.” That was true, though if Miller correct, the boast from Trump’s FBI director should be discarded — because crime stats in cities led by Democratic officials are “fake,” which necessarily throws off the bureau’s figures.

Article: is not short, but this was especially egregious: The conspiracy theorist, who has a lengthy record of promoting bizarre and unscientific ideas, announced that he and the Trump administration are terminating a series of federal contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines. Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, told The Associated Press: “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business.” Around the same time, Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the surgeon general during Donald Trump’s first term, added via social media: “I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions — but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives.” The president tried to defend the decision, but failed. Bhattacharya, a deeply unfortunate choice to lead the NIH, conceded in his opinion piece that the mRNA platform is “promising,” and has the potential to “deliver breakthroughs.” So why in the world is the Republican administration, as Bhattacharya put it, “winding down its mRNA vaccine development activities”? His Post piece stressed a few points, but this was the heart of his defense: [A]s a vaccine intended for broad public use, especially during a public health emergency, the platform has failed a crucial test: earning public trust. The NIH director bolstered his point by pointing to polls showing Americans’ reluctance to get Covid booster shots, which were developed through mRNA research, before peddling some baseless claims about the Biden administration’s “scientific overreach” and “arrogance.” So, let’s take stock. “The vaccines that harnessed it against Covid saved an estimated 20 million lives, a rapid development that was recognized with a Nobel Prize.” The same Times report added that mRNA research has raised hopes of possible treatments — and perhaps even cures — for deadly cancers and a host of genetic and chronic diseases. Even Trump himself has celebrated mRNA vaccines — the president explicitly referred to them as a “modern-day miracle” — before he put the nation’s public health infrastructure in the hands of a guy who has claimed, among other things, that Wi-Fi causes “leaky brain.” But according to the NIH director, the scientific potential apparently doesn’t matter. What does matter, Bhattacharya argued, is that mRNA research hasn’t “earned public trust.” To be sure, I’m not in a position to say which areas of scientific research have been embraced by the American mainstream.

Article: Ahead of Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, The New York Times appeared to give the American president something new to talk about with his Russian counterpart. investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia “is at least partly responsible for a recent hack of the computer system that manages federal court documents, including highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes.” The report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.” Those with sensitive documents within the system have apparently been advised to quickly remove them. The internal memo to Justice Department officials and staffers from the courts system, according to the Times, added: “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.” This was, in other words, a rather serious cyberoffensive. After noting that he “could” bring this up during his scheduled talks with Putin, Trump added that Russian cyberattackers are “good at it.” In other words, there’s reason to believe a foreign adversary launched an offensive targeting highly sensitive U.S. The developments came on the heels of Trump backing off threatened sanctions on Russia — for the fifth time — and extending an invitation to Putin to come to American soil, giving the accused war criminal the validation he was looking for.

Article: MIAMI (AP) — The fate of a makeshift immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” hung in the balance on Wednesday as a federal judge considered whether building on sensitive wetlands violated environmental laws. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing, part of a lawsuit seeking to halt operations and further construction. DeSantis blindsided Florida county officials with ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ plans, emails show The judge concluded a multi-day hearing on Wednesday without making an immediate decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction. President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe have sued over the facility, saying it was hastily set up without the environmental impact considerations needed for all federal projects, even though it deals with immigration, a federal matter. Ron DeSantis has said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after. When asked by the judge why a detention facility needed to be located in the middle of the Everglades, Jesse Panuccio, an attorney representing the state of Florida, referred to government officials’ statements that the remote location and existing runway made it ideal for immigration detention. “Why in the middle of the Everglades?” Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers. Chris Ajizian, an attorney for the Miccosukee Tribe, said that neither the state nor federal government gave the tribe any notice of their plans for a detention facility, despite legal obligations and the tribe’s incontrovertible connection to the Everglades.

Article: Jeff Chiu | AP Perplexity AI's bid on Tuesday to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion represents a dramatic moment for the internet search giant, a week before it celebrates the 20th anniversary of its IPO. Department of Justice, which filed the landmark case against Google in 2020, indicated after its victory in court that it was considering a possible breakup of Google as an antitrust remedy. Google Legal Chief Kent Walker said in response to the DOJ that its "approach would result in unprecedented government overreach" and would harm the country's effort to maintain economic and tech leadership. The company is shelling out tens of billions of dollars a year on artificial intelligence infrastructure and AI services while facing the risk that consumers will be spending a lot less time on traditional search as ChatGPT and other AI-powered alternatives provide new ways to access information. "This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google," co-founder Larry Page said in a blog post at the time. Page moved from CEO of Google to become chief executive of Alphabet, promoting Sundar Pichai, who had been a senior vice president in charge of internet businesses, to run Google. With an increasingly dominant position on the internet, Pichai and team have had to continue looking for growth areas, particularly in AI, while simultaneously fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. Here's a breakdown of how some analysts value Alphabet's top non-search assets: Chrome watch now The browser is key to Alphabet's ad business, which uses data from Chrome to help with targeted advertisements. Google originally launched Chrome in 2008 as an effort to "add value for users and, at the same time, help drive innovation on the web." Perplexity's offer doesn't stack up to analyst estimates, but it's still much higher than Perplexity's own valuation, which reached $18 billion in July. If a deal for Chrome is on the table, analysts at Raymond James value the browser at $50 billion, based on 2.25 billion users and Google's revenue share agreements with phone manufacturers that preinstall Chrome on devices. Bob O'Donnell of market research firm TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that Chrome is "not directly monetizable," because it serves as a gateway and that it's "not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective." Google Cloud A person takes a photo of the Google Cloud logo, during the 2025 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, March 4, 2025. Albert Gea | Reuters Google's cloud unit, which is third in the cloud infrastructure market behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, is one of Alphabet's key growth engines and its biggest business outside of digital advertising. Demand is so high that the company's cloud services now have a backlog, a measure of future committed revenue, of $106 billion, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the earnings call. Davidson analysts, who have the highest ascribed valuation at $682 billion, and TD Cowen analysts note that while Google still trails AWS and Azure, it's growing faster than Amazon's cloud business and has the potential for a premium valuation. Mat Hayward | Variety | Getty Images Google's $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 is generally viewed as one of the best acquisitions ever by an internet company, alongside Facebook's $1 billion deal for Instagram in 2012. Dubbing it the "new king of all media," MoffettNathanson values YouTube at between $475 billion and $550 billion, arguing that it's larger and more powerful than any other player in Hollywood. When Alphabet was formed as Google's parent company, it created an "Other Bets" category to include businesses that it liked to call "moonshots," a term that had already made its way into Google lexicon.

Article: President Donald Trump announced federal take over of the Metropolitan Police Department under the Home Rule Act to assist in crime prevention in the nation’s capital, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 12, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump called Washington, D.C., a city overrun by "violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" as he moved to federalize the city's police force and deploy hundreds of National Guard members. His dire depiction of the nation's capital is at odds, however, with federal data showing that violent crime in the District has dropped to its lowest level in three decades. Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty Images Washington experienced a spike in crime in 2023, with the highest number of homicides reported in the District since the 1990s and a surge in the number of reported carjackings. Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst and co-founder of data analytics firm AH Datalytics, told CNBC that Americans broadly "always think crime is rising," even if the data shows otherwise. A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters — 68% — said that reducing crime should be a top policy priority for the president and Congress in 2024, compared to 47% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Asher told CNBC that policymakers should not "base their crime-reduction strategies and policy and programs on the perception issue." He said that policy decisions should be based on data, but to make "people feel safe, we have to address the perception issue." "I think that they're two very different sides of a similar coin," he continued.

He took a direct role in a peace pledge signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, at the White House, and there have been other regional conflicts in which he’s played an important role. Those, of course, are the Israel-Hamas war and the Russian war with Ukraine, which he famously declared that he would solve in 24 hours, on the basis of his long and, in his view, respectful relationship with Putin. He has now come to question whether that relationship is what he thought it was, or at least what he portrayed it as, because Putin has held a series of perfectly friendly, constructive phone calls with him and then continued on the same battle plan that he was on before, with considerable recent success.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. — Adam Wollner Texas Democrats plot their exit strategy By Ben Kamisar and Natasha Korecki With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the talks. What we will do, what we’re going to do in the future, we’re in discussions right now,” Texas Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu said Wednesday on “Meet the Press NOW.” Wu said they would not finalize their next steps until there was “consensus among our membership.” But he noted Democrats have other avenues to push back against the GOP’s redistricting effort in the courts, through the legislative process and with other states, like California, countering with new congressional maps. We can throw everything at this.” Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum in the state House so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. So while it appears likely that Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. Alex Brandon / AP President Donald Trump is not just taking over the police in the nation’s capital, with FBI and DEA agents on nighttime patrols in Georgetown and armored vehicles lined up in front of the Washington Monument. Trump also told reporters he was “98%” involved in choosing this year’s honorees for one of the nation’s highest lifetime achievement awards: Sylvester Stallone, Michael Crawford, George Strait, Gloria Gaynor and Kiss. Unlike his predecessors, Trump never hosted the awardees at the White House nor attended the gala concert in his first term, citing criticism from some of the Hollywood stars being celebrated. Elsewhere in Washington, the administration now plans to put its stamp on eight of the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, including American history, African American history, air and space, and the National Museum of the American Indian. The criticism by many, if not most, historians is that this risks distorting the reality of America’s founding, which includes the reality that the genius of the Founding Fathers’ creation was scarred by the reality that they were all white, male and largely property owners — including many slave owners. It spawned a reckoning that eventually led to the brutality of the Civil War, followed by a century of legalized segregation, and continuing generational poverty and second-class citizenship for millions of Americans. The administration has already had an impact on the Smithsonian, whose board is led by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and by statute also includes the vice president. According to the 6,000-member Organization of American Historians, the nation’s museums and historic parks are “under assault” by Trump’s March 27 executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” A White House spokesman calls it common sense.

Article: Illinois courts will not force Texas Democrats back to the state, a judge ruled Wednesday, dealing a blow to Attorney General Ken Paxton and House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ efforts to restore the headcount necessary to pass the GOP’s new congressional map. Illinois courts’ cannot consider whether “foreign legislators” were willfully evading their duties, and they cannot direct Illinois law enforcement to execute civil quorum warrants upon “nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois,” Larson said, noting that the warrants specifically say they are to be enforced within Texas. Even if the court were to take up the case, which Larson ruled it lacks the ability to do, the response would be a ruling on whether the lawmakers are willfully disobeying a court order — not an order returning them to Texas as Paxton and Burrows demanded, Larson said. The county voted for Trump by 47 percentage points in 2024, suggesting Paxton was seeking a friendlier venue than he might have found in DuPage County — where the Democrats are staying — which went for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 14 points.

(Nick Drake’s own work has received renewed interest with the release last month of the boxed set “The Making of Five Leaves Left.”) Yet for all her struggles, she guarded her inner life. “She made her mystery available to us, without revealing what it was.” She added: “She was a bit of an enigma.” Molly Drake’s wry humor and poetic flavor are evident in original compositions like “Night Is My Friend” that reveal her to be a forerunner of the confessional singer-songwriter movement that emerged in the 1960s and ’70s.

Article: Now researchers at UC Riverside have found that home sale prices are 2.4% to 5.4% lower than they would be if the land were stable, translating to per-home losses of $6,689 to $16,165. Mehdi Nemati, a UC Riverside assistant professor of environmental economics and policy who led the study, said his team knew that sinking land was already affecting homes and homeowners across the Central Valley, with cracking foundations, dry wells, higher insurance premiums and increased stress. “Land subsidence is a very slow problem.” The economists found that land subsidence has lowered the value of homes across eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley by $1.87 billion over the six-year period. “And I expect that land subsidence is going to be very low on their list of things that they think affect the price.” Agricultural wells have been drawing heavily on groundwater, lowering aquifer levels. In another recent study , Stanford University researchers also found that the problem has been worsening in recent years, and that large portions of the valley have subsided at a record pace since 2006. Advertisement The study’s findings show that lower home values are one more costly effect of chronic groundwater overpumping that warrants attention, said Amanda Fencl, climate science director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. The goal, Fencl said, should be to prevent the “very clear harms that are occurring from this extensive groundwater overuse.” She said she hopes the link between subsidence and home values will lead to a “rallying cry” from people in the valley who feel it’s unfair that “we aren’t the ones pumping, and yet you’re affecting our ability to maintain and sell our homes.” The researchers said it’s a major problem that requires big solutions — and fast. Areas with rapid subsidence dropped about 7 or more inches a year across the eight counties they studied, with parts of Tulare and Kings counties seeing the most dramatic movement, up to a foot or more a year. She blames the ongoing implementation of the state’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act as well as “bad actors,” including hedge funds and other outside investors that are among the region’s major water users.

Article: In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan off following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on Aug. AFP via Getty Images Russian media is crowing about the choice of location for the summit -- cheering the idea that Trump and Putin will decide the fate of the war alone and that Alaska's distance from Europe underlines how European countries and Ukraine are being sidelined. Some Russian media commentators also note how Alaska was once Russian territory, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the United States for a pittance in 1867 Many observers, particularly Russian, are dismissing the meeting as a sign Trump has allowed Putin to once again deceive him. Some Russian analysts have suggested the surprise summit, in fact, is a graceful way for both Putin and Trump to sidestep the awkward issue of Trump's own deadline last week to impose the new sanctions if Russia didn't end the war. "For Trump, it's an opportunity to save face in a situation when he actually has few ways of pressuring Moscow," Farida Rustamova and Margarita Lituova, Russian journalists who closely cover the Kremlin, wrote on their Substack. "For Putin, a personal meeting would help him to maintain a relationship with Trump, who is clearly inclined to sympathize with the Russian position." Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference during his visit to Vienna, Austria, June 16, 2025. has received a signal from Russia that it may be "ready to end the war, or at least to make a first step towards a ceasefire." "This was the first such signal from them," Zelenskyy told reporters. The Wall Street Journal and others have reported Putin is now demanding Ukraine hand over the remainder of unoccupied eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in exchange for halting his offensive on two other southeastern regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But those demands would still be extreme -- Ukraine would be giving up a huge swath of territory, home to hundreds of thousands of people and important defensive strongholds, in exchange for almost nothing. Andrii Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told ABC News he believes Putin will almost certainly propose demands he knows are unacceptable so that Ukraine will alienate Trump by rejecting them.

A Tract spokesperson said last week in a statement to The Charlotte Observer that the company was “both disappointed and surprised” by the mayor’s previous comments indicating he no longer supported the project. When he wasn’t at the racetrack, he was an avid outdoorsman, and neighbors said he used the North Carolina property at the center of the recent battle for hunting and fishing. Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s eldest son, blasted efforts to rezone the property on social media recently, saying his father “would be livid for his name to be associated” with the project. Wednesday’s announcement makes Mooresville the latest city where developers have either backed off their plans for a data center, or had their plans for a data center voted down by local leaders amid public backlash. “We can’t just take rural residential land and destroy it forever.” Late last week, Carney, the mayor, cast doubts on the project’s prospects because Tract hadn’t said which tech company would ultimately use the facility once it was built.

Article: 13 Investigates: New Uvalde records show district limited information, teachers felt ignored UVALDE, Texas (KTRK) -- After a teenager killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one teacher told the district's superintendent, "it feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." On June 12, 2022, a Robb Elementary teacher whose classroom sustained gunshots through its windows recalled details of the attack in an email to the superintendent. I had shrapnel in my back from when he shot in my window, I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students." I told my students I loved them, I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray. Robb Elementary School teacher In an email sent 19 days after the deadly shooting, the teacher said she gave every part of herself to the school and her friends and students who died gave their lives. We were asked to be patient and understanding, so I have; but it feels as if the Rodd (sic) staff that survived, especially us in that 4th grade building are being ignored. It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." That teacher's email was among thousands of pages of emails released this week by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District and provides a peek into behind-the-scenes communications at the district in the days and weeks after the shooting. RELATED: Uvalde school district releases records for 2022 classroom shooting after legal fight over access Previously released body camera video shows Uvalde CISD police and other responding officers stood in the hallway for 77 minutes before breaching the classroom on May 24, 2022. Uvalde CISD records for the now-deceased shooter Salvador Ramos indicate he was absent for 161 days during the 2019-2020 school year and considered "at risk." Notes in his student file say he "has excessive absences and is missing a lot of work," and that he is "failing due to unsubmitted assignments." He was ranked near the end of his class as the 312th student out of 318 students. He withdrew from Uvalde High School in October 2021 for "poor academic performance" and "lack of attendance." Seven months later, Ramos crashed his car near Robb Elementary, entered with an assault rifle, went into a classroom, and within minutes fired more than 100 rounds at elementary school students and teachers. Four days after the shooting, an email from Uvalde CISD's director of student services to nearly 20 employees reminding them not to share campus safety plans with reporters or other outside sources because they are "not public information." "I watched a couple news reports last night and unfortunately there is information being reported that is not accurate. Review your plans and be refreshed on what you have in place and what deficiencies you have at your campus and how they are being addressed," the director said in an email on May 28, 2025. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, told ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." 13 Investigates reached out to Uvalde CISD and asked if the district's perception changed after more information came out about how things played out that day. "We have pledged to inform our families and the greater Uvalde school community about the release of these documents before they are made available to the media, and this notice serves to uphold that promise," the district said.

Article: President Donald Trump says homeless people in the nation’s capital will be moved far from the city as part of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia and crackdown on crime. takeover as statistics show decline in crime With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. Washington’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.” READ MORE: Why this widespread form of homelessness is often overlooked and unsupported Citing a city regulation that she said gives local police “the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments,” Leavitt said homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services.” Those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.” In the past five months, the U.S. Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed. He said the outreach would continue through the week with a “greater level of urgency.” Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.” What are people in Washington saying? Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do. WATCH: DC Mayor Bowser calls Trump takeover of DC police ‘unsettling’ Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she is more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in the city where she was born and raised.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call. Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said. Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday’s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. “There’s a very good chance that we’re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I’m going to find out where we are and what we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there.” The president also said Russia will face “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war.

Article: We haven’t [had] much preparation, but you could see that football is not only about the physical aspect – it is also about the mental aspect, being in the right place, having the right tactics,” PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus. “They sat back a lot after going 2-0 up, and it is dangerous to invite PSG to come at you like that.” The Super Cup is an annual early-season match between the most recent winners of the Champions League (PSG) and Europa League (Tottenham), and it was hardly going to script when the English club took a 2-0 lead early in the second half. Defenders popped up with Spurs’ goals, with Micky van de Ven showing quick reactions to prod home the opener in the 39th minute after new PSG goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha’s shot onto the crossbar. Chevalier – playing ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced Tuesday he was leaving PSG – might have been unlucky with the first goal but was to blame for the second after failing to keep out a header from newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero in the 48th. Advertisement Tottenham is further along in its preparations for the new campaign than PSG, whose players have only just returned to training after being involved in the Club World Cup until mid-July, and looked much sharper at Stadio Friuli. PSG finished strongly, though, and hit Tottenham with late goals as Lee smashed in a low shot from the edge of the area and Ramos headed home Ousmane Dembele’s right-wing cross. Frank took over in the offseason following the firing of Ange Postecoglou, who led Tottenham to its first trophy in 17 years with a victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final in May. “I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world – maybe the best in this moment in time,” Frank told TNT Sports. It is a flip of a coin when you go into a penalty shootout.” PSG completed the Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season, also winning the Trophee des Champions in January.

Article: Stop Killing Civilians” on the pitch before the Super Cup football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham in Udine, Italy, in the wake of heavy fallout over its meek tribute to a Palestinian player killed by Israel. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah last week criticised a UEFA tribute to the late Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pele”, after European football’s governing body failed to reference the circumstances surrounding his killing. Salah responded, “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Speaking to Al Jazeera last week, Bassil Mikdadi, the founder of Football Palestine, said he did not expect the football body to respond to the criticism. Advertisement “Suleiman al-Obeid is not the first Palestinian footballer to perish in this genocide – there’s been over 400 – but he’s by far the most prominent as of now.” Salah, one of the Premier League’s biggest stars, has advocated for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza during the nearly two-year-long war. The banner move came a day after the UEFA Foundation for Children announced its latest initiative to help children affected by war in different parts of the world – a partnership with Medecins du Monde, Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF), and Handicap International.

The video above is from the original report: Texas City mayor won't resign after recall petition submitted On Wednesday, Texas City officials announced they were only able to validate 989 of the approximately 1,600 signatures that were reportedly submitted. The TCMPA sent a response to Wednesday's outcome, which read, in part: "The Texas City Municipal Police Association (TCMPA) board would like to extend its deepest gratitude to the citizens, officers, and community leaders who supported the recent effort to recall Mayor Dedrick Johnson. We are incredibly proud of the courage, unity, and support displayed by those who stood with us not just for the interests of law enforcement, but for the greater good of Texas City. The TCMPA remains steadfast in its mission to advocate for transparency, accountability, and respect for the dedicated officers who serve our city, as well as the citizens who call Texas City home. We also acknowledge with concern the multiple reports of blatant acts of retaliation faced by both officers and citizens who simply legally exercised their right to support this democratic process, as well as allegations of the unlawful release of confidential information by city officials that we ensure will be investigated by the attorney generals office." The city said it would take no further action advancing the petition, adding that the forgery allegations would be investigated.

Article: 9 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save Reuters The pictures from last week's sit-in protest in Parliament Square over the banned group Palestine Action were unprecedented. As demonstrators held up placards reading, "I support Palestine Action", some 522 of them were arrested on suspicion of breaking terrorism laws - more than double the total such arrests in 2024. The battle over the ban on Palestine Action (PAG) - last month, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - now feels as much a political and PR battle as a legal one. And the organisers of the campaign are trying to capitalise on perceived sympathy among some of the public by organising another demonstration in September - hoping to force the state, through numbers, to lift the ban. "I've seen police look incredibly uncomfortable with the fact that they are having to treat these elderly people as criminals," said solicitor Katie McFadden, who advised many protesters, after their arrests, last Saturday. "I've seen them in police custody and they've certainly been considerate and looked, frankly, quite shocked and horrified that this is what they were having to do as part of their job when they've signed up to go out and protect the public from dangerous criminals." The real challenge for the police and prosecutors is how many protesters do they need to charge with support of a banned terrorist organisation to send a message to the public. EPA The average age of those arrested was 54, police say, with 112 over the age of 70 So far, three people have been charged with displaying an item showing support for Palestine Action during the first demonstration on 5 July. The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had to consult the Attorney General's Office before he could go ahead with the charges because of additional safeguards in some terrorism cases. That means that Lord Hermer, the Attorney General and also a cabinet minister, or his deputy, may have to be involved in each of the files that police send to prosecutors. That, in turn, means the vast majority of the 700 may not know for months if they are going to end up on trial - in cases that could be more than a year away from a jury. Huda Ammori, Palestine Action's co-founder, has said on social media: "The system can't cope when thousands resist." EPA But ministers hope that the difference between the organisation she founded and other forms of protest over Gaza will become clear thanks to the second of the three linked legal battles soon to take centre stage. That incident prompted national security officials and the police to look at whether a terrorism ban on PAG could be justified, after having previously concluded that the vast majority of its highly disruptive activities amounted to minor criminal damage. Metropolitan Police The police set up two arrest processing points in central London to deal with the number of protesters who were arrested Documents disclosed to the BBC in the High Court show how the thinking on a ban had evolved. So when Cooper banned PAG, her decision was largely informed by what the Home Office has described as millions of pounds of criminal damage, not an assessment that it was a group of murderous militants. "There may be people who are objecting to proscription who don't know the full nature of this organisation due to court restrictions on reporting while serious prosecutions are under way but it's really important that no one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock If the ban is overturned in the High Court then hundreds of those arrested would see their cases collapse

Article: New York’s attorney general has sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case under the Trump administration FILE - Options to use the Zelle payments network are seen on a mobile banking app in New York, Dec. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) NEW YORK -- New York's attorney general on Wednesday sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case as the Trump administration was gutting the agency. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year dropped a similar case after President Donald Trump fired the agency's leader and his administration halted nearly all the bureau's work, closed its headquarters and moved to fire many of its workers. In a statement, James' office noted that its suit was filed after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned its lawsuit following a “change in the federal administration.” “No one should be left to fend for themselves after falling victim to a scam,” James said in a statement. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures.” James has been a leading antagonist of Trump, a Republican, and has sued him dozens of times. Last week, The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that the Justice Department has subpoenaed James as part of an investigation into whether she violated Trump's civil rights, according to people familiar with the matter. In one instance cited by the attorney general's office, a Zelle user got a call from someone posing as an employee of the utility company Con Edison who told the user that his electricity was going to be shut off unless he sent them money through Zelle. The user then transferred about $1,500 to a Zelle account named “Coned Billing" and then realized he had been scammed but was told by his bank that he could not get his money back, James' office said. In a statement issued through a spokesperson, Zelle called James' lawsuit “a political stunt to generate press, not progress.” “The Attorney General should focus on the hard facts, stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law, not overreach and meritless claims,” the statement said.

Article: The governor of New Mexico has declared a state of emergency in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities SANTA FE, N.M. -- The governor of New Mexico declared a state of emergency Wednesday in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities. Michelle Lujan Grisham makes $750,000 available in response to calls by local governments and tribal officials in Rio Arriba County for reinforcements against violent crime as well as other crime and hardships associated with illicit drugs. The vast area stretches from the city of Española, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Santa Fe, to the Colorado state line and has long been afflicted by opioid use and high drug-overdose death rates, with homeless encampments emerging in recent years in more populated areas. “The surge in criminal activity has contributed to increased homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses, placing extraordinary strain on local governments and police departments that have requested immediate state assistance," Lujan Grisham said in a statement. In April, Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency in New Mexico’s largest city, Albuquerque, saying that a significant increase in crime in Albuquerque warrants the help of the New Mexico National Guard. The tribal governor of Santa Clara Pueblo on the edge of Española urged the state to address a growing public safety crisis stemming from the use and abuse of fentanyl and alcohol in the community at large. “But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime, and increased homelessness extend to the wider community.” In 2020, President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime.

Article: Plans to expand the oldest wildlife refuge in Texas have been scrapped in favor of President Donald Trump’s effort to “unleash American energy.” The reversal, which was announced last month, has conservationists and advocates concerned about the future of wildlife in the Texas High Plains. At the refuge, located in the small town of Muleshoe about 68 miles northwest of Lubbock, the plan aimed to protect and restore grasslands that are an essential habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Jodey Arrington and Ronny Jackson, Republicans who represent the region and called the acquisition a “land grab.” However, the Biden plan was voluntary, and the service would have worked with willing sellers to expand conservation efforts. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to reducing regulatory burdens, strengthening partnerships with state and local stakeholders, and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources,” said Justin “J” Shirley, the principal deputy director of the U.S. The refuge may have never expanded into all of those acres, it was just plotted out where they wanted to acquire land if private landowners wanted to sell it to them.” Leahy said the expansion would have brought more hunting and fishing opportunities to the area. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement to the Tribune that the service will “take no actions to acquire lands within the acquisition boundary, seek any appropriations from Congress or submit any land acquisition proposals for approval by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for any lands within the LPP expanded acquisition boundary.” Jarid Manos, founder of the Great Plains Restoration Council, said the land, water and native wildlife in the High Plains, including prairie dogs and pronghorn antelope, are clinging to survival.

Article: ADHD drugs have wider life benefits, study suggests 20 minutes ago Share Save Philippa Roxby Health Reporter Share Save Getty Images Drug treatment can help people newly diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to reduce their risk of substance misuse, suicidal behaviour, transport accidents and criminality, a study suggests. The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of: suicidal behaviour - 17% substance misuse - 15% transport accidents - 12% criminal behaviour - 13% When recurrent events were analysed, the researchers found ADHD medication was linked to reductions of: 15% for suicide attempts 25% for substance misuses 4% for accidental injuries 16% for transport accidents 25% for criminal behaviour "Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," said Prof Samuele Cortese, study author and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at University of Southampton. "Now we have evidence they [drugs] can reduce these risks." This could be explained by medication reducing impulsive behaviour and lack of concentration, which might reduce the risk of accidents while driving and reduce aggressive behaviour which could lead to criminality.

Article: That the mainstream press wasn’t, in his view, doing an effective job of conveying the functional racism at play in the Donald Trump-backed gerrymandering effort in Texas, which is deliberately designed to target majority-Black and majority-Latino districts. Unfortunately, we have grown to the point in this country where you can use racism against people of color, but people of color can't respond and say, ‘That’s racism.’ If we do, you’re not going to print it. Just last week, Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights-averse head of the DOJ’s civil rights division, claimed during an interview that the racist gerrymandering effort in Texas isn’t truly racist but, instead, an effort to dismantle the “racial spoils” that Democrats have purportedly reaped from laws designed to combat racist gerrymandering. Abbott essentially claimed that the GOP plan couldn’t possibly be racist, because it would create additional Hispanic-majority districts, though that obviously doesn’t preclude the maps from being racist to Black people — and it’s worth noting that the new districts were were drawn specifically to favor conservative-leaning Hispanics. During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, DeSantis said he’s entitled to further gerrymander his state’s congressional map because then-President Barack Obama and then-Attorney General Eric Holder “gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade’s census.” That’s another lie, though Obama and Holder have advocated against gerrymandering. In reality, Florida Republicans — who controlled their state’s most recent redistricting process — drew gerrymandered maps that DeSantis pressured them to gerrymander further with a proposal from his office that diluted Black voter power. Nonetheless, the governor portrayed Florida’s map as unfairly weighted in favor of minority groups and claimed “there’s some racial gerrymandering that’s still lingering that we have to correct, per a recent Florida Supreme Court decision.” Indeed, Florida’s Republican-packed Supreme Court ruled last month that DeSantis could move forward with his gerrymandering plan, but the court also acknowledged that the plan would diminish the power of Black voters. All this to say, evidence abounds that Republicans are waging a racist assault on the American voting system — even as they wage a propaganda campaign to present this push as something else entirely.

Article: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones could soon be forced to stop airing his Infowars show and give up the company's property, including everything from desks and microphones to the Infowars brand name. A state judge in Texas Wednesday ordered Infowars' assets to be turned over to a newly-appointed state receiver, who will sell them to pay the families of the Connecticut children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The move paves the way for the receiver — or sheriffs — to start the process of seizing cash and property owned by Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, within days. The families, who've spent some three years in federal bankruptcy court trying to collect what Jones owes them, could start seeing their first payouts through the state court in weeks or months. Sponsor Message "The families are pleased that the court has placed InfoWars parent company into receivership, which will finally lead to accountability for Alex Jones' monstrously cruel harassment" said Mark Bankston, one of the attorneys for the families. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble's order in Travis County, Texas district court appointing a receiver, Gregory Milligan, will also be key to whether Jones gets to keep broadcasting under his Infowars brand or has to start over in some new form. toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America Most of the Sandy Hook families still want the Infowars name and property sold to the satirical site The Onion, which vowed to turn Infowars into a parody of itself. It was a win for Jones, who argued his company should have been sold to First United American Companies, which has ties to Jones and was widely expected to keep him on air. The order adds that "any Sheriff, Constable or officer of the Peace shall assist the Receiver in carrying out his duties and exercising his powers under this Order." Sponsor Message "Now that there's a receiver in place, Alex Jones is no longer going to control the Infowars brand. "It's not a panacea, but it's a more favorable venue to be in," says Larry Ponoroff, dean and professor emeritus at Tulane Law School and a professor of legal practice at Wilmington University School of Law. The Onion did not respond to requests for comment on its plans, but the company has previously vowed to continue trying to buy Infowars to ensure "a positive outcome for the horror [the Sandy Hook families] endured." There was no immediate comment from Jones' lawyers, but Jones himself railed against the judge on his show after the hearing, accusing her of overreach, and saying her order runs afoul of federal bankruptcy court orders. But because the bankruptcy judge ruled Jones' behavior "willful and malicious," the bankruptcy will not erase Jones' debt, meaning families can keep claiming any money he makes in the future until he pays the $1.3 billion he owes them. Sponsor Message The Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his companies for defamation in Connecticut and Texas in 2018, after twenty young children and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting.

"Indian IT services companies exploded over the last six months and we've gradually reduced our positions and sold all of them in our portfolio," said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex Japan equity team. And for that kind of growth, valuation and yield, it doesn't make any sense to own it in Asia-Pacific where there are opportunities to buy much cheaper companies with higher yield and growth," Duhra said. India's Nifty IT Index — which comprises 10 Indian IT companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — has plunged nearly 20% so far this year, underperforming the 22.2% surge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and the 12.16% gain in the Nasdq-100 Technology Sector Index.

The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an "authoritarian push" at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix - even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin A "significantly higher" presence of guard members was expected Wednesday night, and federal agents will be out during the day as well as at night, according to the White House. Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. She added, "It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?" Targeting a variety of infractions The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Violent crime has dropped in the district The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, "I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too." She had previously called Trump's moves "unsettling and unprecedented" while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. "It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American." ___ Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report.

Article: Jimmy Lai: Landmark trial of Hong Kong's rebel mogul resumes 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save Getty Images Lai is on trial for breaching national security and colluding with foreign forces Hailed by some as a hero and scorned by others as a traitor, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is in the final stage of his national security trial. Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. "I have a very rebellious character." He is the most prominent person charged under the controversial national security law which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. Reuters Lai is among the most prominent people charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city. Getty Images Apple Daily was unafraid to be openly critical of the Chinese state When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the "death knell" for the territory. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: "Mr President, please help us." For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.

Article: President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to streamline federal regulation governing commercial rocket launches, a move that would benefit Elon Musk's SpaceX and other private space ventures. It added: "Overly complex environmental and other licensing and permitting regulations slow down commercial space launches and infrastructure development, and benefit entrenched incumbents (who can afford to bear the expense of regulatory compliance) over new market entrants (who cannot)." Although Musk and Trump have remained embroiled in a high-profile feud for months, the billionaire entrepreneur's SpaceX rocket and satellite venture potentially stands to be the single biggest immediate beneficiary of Trump's order on Wednesday. Musk has complained that environmental impact reviews and post-flight mishap investigations have repeatedly slowed down testing of SpaceX's ambitious new Starship rocket vehicle, under development at the company's South Texas launch facility.

Article: Hot, dry summers bring new 'firewave' risk to UK cities, scientists warn 1 hour ago Share Save Justin Rowlatt • @BBCJustinR Climate Editor Share Save Getty Images A firefighter tackling a fire in east London on Tuesday Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called "firewaves" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned. The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry. "Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable," explained Professor Rein, "it becomes much more flammable." "Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire," he added. "I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed," said Prof Rein. "And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent." Managing fire risk Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible. "We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach." BBC / Kevin Church This area of Dagenham was hit by a fire earlier this year To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment. "It allows us to target our efforts where the risk to life and property is greatest." In addition to drones, the brigade has introduced off-road vehicles capable of reaching fires in difficult terrain, such as heathland and grassland.

Article: 'No surrender' from Ukraine and 'Policing minister provokes ridicule' 15 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Ukraine leads the majority of the papers on Thursday, ahead of peace talks between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. "Protect Ukraine from 'bluffing' Putin, Zelensky urges Trump" says the i Paper, after the Ukrainian president and other European leaders, who are not attending the meeting in Alaska, held a joint call with Trump on Wednesday to reiterate their position. The paper reported that European leaders have been worried that Trump "might be prepared to strike a deal on territory" without the input of Zelensky, and that the Wednesday meeting went some way to "calm their fears". After meeting with European leaders, the Guardian reports that Trump said he would push for a second meeting with Putin "almost immediately" if his Friday summit in Alaska goes well. The front page also features a story on foreign aid, with the paper reporting that ministers are considering "scrapping" a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid on projects that support gender equality. The Telegraph says that the meeting in Alaska will see Trump offer Putin access to "rare earth minerals" as an "incentive" to end the war in Ukraine, and that the US president is also prepared to lift sanctions on the Russia's aviation industry. The Times has similarly headlined with Trump's "warning to Putin on eve of talks", and allege the US and Russia have already discussed a "model" for ending the war that would "mirror Israel's occupation of the West Bank". "Fight house" reads the Daily Star's front page, as the paper reports Trump is planning to "host UFC fight bouts on the lawns of the White House" in 2026 to celebrate 250 years of America. The Express says policing minister Dame Diana Johnson "provoked ridicule" after her comments on BBC Radio 4 when she condemned shoplifters but said "stores need to play their part in making sure that items that are high value are not at the front".

Article: What we learned from Taylor Swift's highly anticipated podcast interview 45 minutes ago Share Save Max Matza & Christal Hayes BBC News Share Save Watch: Taylor Swift appears in Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast 'New Heights' Taylor Swift made her highly anticipated podcast debut on New Heights, hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce. The pop superstar used the appearance to announce her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and give some updates on her life since the Eras Tour, which ran almost two years and spanned five continents before ending in December. More than 1.3 million tuned in live for the programme as Swift offered insights into her relationship with Travis, the notorious easter eggs she plants in music for fans and even titbits on her sourdough-bread-baking hobby. Teaser clips of the New Heights podcast went viral before her episode aired, including one video clip where Swift unveils a briefcase with "TS" on it and pulls out her new 12th studio album, which will be available 3 October. Poking fun at male sports fans The episode begins with a screaming introduction from Jason, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, who runs through a long list of his brother's girlfriend's accomplishments, including being the only artist to win the album of the year Grammy four times. In 2023 when the pair started dating and she started making appearances, game cameras looked for the singer in the stands - cutting to her more than a dozen times during some games. Swift was booed by NFL fans during her appearance on the jumbotron screen at the Super Bowl last February, which drew headlines and even social media posts by President Donald Trump. What the cover of her new album looks like Taylor Swift announces new album during podcast As the countdown clock ran down on her website and the podcast started, Swift's website updated with the cover of her 12th studio album. Insights into how she crafts her hidden easter eggs She also spoke about all the ways she uses easter eggs to tease her music and plant hidden clues for fans. The hidden clues are "something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason, but you'll go back and be like 'Oh my God!'" She said that her favourite example was a speech she gave when she received an honourary doctorate. "I put so many lyrical easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnights album came out, after that, the fans were like, 'The whole speech was an easter egg!'" She spoke about her love of numbers and dates. Taylor gets emotional speaking about her masters In May this year, it was announced that she had bought the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running and highly publicised battle over the ownership of her music. "I want this because it was my handwritten diary entries from my entire life." She said that her mother and brother talked with with Shamrock Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, about purchasing her music. She also thanked loyal fans for listening to her re-recorded albums, saying they reacted to the dispute over rights to her music with the Western cowboy expression, "We ride at dawn". "I think a lot of the vocals I did on the re-records were better than the original," she said, adding that she is especially fond of the remake of her 2012 album Red.

Last week Trump warned there could be "some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both", leading to fears Ukraine might have to give up some areas in order to end the bloody conflict. Addressing a virtual meeting of the European leaders following the call with Trump, Sir Keir said "any ceasefire would have to be lasting and to be lasting it would need security guarantees". The coalition is a group of mainly European countries who have pledged to provide military support to Ukraine - including potentially boots on the ground - in order to deter Russia from breaching any agreed peace deal. "Now we do have that chance, because of the work the president has put in." Vance is currently on a private family holiday in the UK, and also joined the call with Sir Keir and other European leaders on Wednesday.

"The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells." In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit," Warren said.

Article: President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon "should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ." In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle. "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost," Mericle said. UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that "the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices," while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase , said in a note that tariffs could "add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred." Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

Article: By the end of the century, rising sea levels could push powerful seasonal waves into Easter Island’s 15 iconic moai statues, according to a new study published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. “Sea level rise is real,” said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. “It’s not a distant threat.” Paoa, who is from Easter Island — known to its Indigenous people as Rapa Nui — and his colleagues built a high-resolution “digital twin” of the island’s eastern coastline and ran computer models to simulate future wave impacts under various sea level rise scenarios. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.” Possible defenses for Ahu Tongariki range from armoring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.

Article: In a lengthy statement, Friez said that replacing Confederate-era monikers and removing statues was an attack on the “country’s heritage.” “This is a distraction from what really matters right now,” said Ebony Coleman, founder of Jumpstart Midland, an education advocacy group in Midland, adding that the school district should focus on the students’ academic outcomes. “I feel like (the board) knew that this was ultimately what they were going to do.” Stephanie Howard, the district’s superintendent, said the change could cost them as much as $62,000. Parents, alumni and former teachers who spoke on Tuesday evening said the school’s ties to Lee, commander of the Confederate states army, provoked hurt and discomfort, saying his name evoked a period of history when schools were segregated. Sue Roseberry, who in 1981 moved to West Texas from New Mexico, said her two daughters and most of her grandchildren attended the school before it was renamed in 2020. “I want you to know that you have an opportunity [to associate the school] with something that uplifts all of our students.” Barbara Hanley, who taught in the school district for 28 years before retiring, called the effort a waste of money, that “only serves to divide the community further.” “Let the old name die,” she said. Among them was Carrie McNeal, who said the board should have taken up a recommendation in 2020 to change the school's name to Legacy for Equality and Excellence, or L.E.E.
