Article: A new lawsuit filed on Wednesday by a free speech watchdog takes aim at the key legal foundations that the Trump administration has relied on to arrest and attempt to deport foreign students over their criticism of the Israeli government. Lawyers from the free speech group, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, brought the lawsuit on behalf of the student newspaper at Stanford University, The Stanford Daily, arguing that several of its staff members have been forced to self-censor or quit the paper out of fear that the government could retaliate for what it publishes. The lawsuit says that the newspaper, which is open to all students and has more than 150 members, according to the complaint, has weathered resignations and withdrawn stories by noncitizens who were concerned that publishing content about Israel or the conditions in Gaza could leave them vulnerable to deportation.

Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, New York University and Harvard University — all accused by the Trump administration of failing to protect Jewish students from harassment — have recently added the job to their administrative rosters. And they point, somewhat unexpectedly, to what they say is a cautionary tale of swollen academic bureaucracy and adverse outcomes: President Barack Obama’s efforts to prevent campus sexual assault under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex.

Article: The former chairman of emergency medicine at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in prison after pleading guilty to stealing more than $1.4 million of public money from the hospital and spending it on luxury goods for himself, his family and his pets. Michael Lucchesi, 67, stole the money over seven years from Downstate, which has been plagued by financial trouble for years, by using a work credit card for cash advances and lavish personal spending. About $348,000 of the purloined money went to personal travel, and $176,000 was spent on pet care, including $120,000 at the Greenleaf Pet Resort & Hotel in New Jersey, prosecutors said. Lucchesi pleaded guilty to one count of larceny in June and was sentenced by Danny Chun, a justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, to three years in prison, and will be eligible for parole after one year.

Article: As part of the settlements struck with two Ivy League universities in recent weeks, the Trump administration will gain access to the standardized test scores and grade point averages of all applicants, including information about their race, a measure that could profoundly alter competitive college admissions. That aspect of the agreements with Columbia and Brown, which goes well beyond the information typically provided to the government, was largely overlooked amid splashier news that the universities had promised to pay tens of millions of dollars to settle claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws, including accusations that they had tolerated antisemitism. The release of such data has been on the wish list of conservatives who are searching for evidence that universities are dodging a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the consideration of race in college admissions, and will probably be sought in the future from many more of them.

Article: Trump has continued his efforts to reshape federal cultural institutions like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress, where he has ousted some leaders and called for an end to what he has called “divisive, race-centered ideology.” At the humanities endowment, the turmoil began in March when the previous chair, a Biden appointee, was forced out. Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled against the administration in a case brought by the Authors Guild, saying that the cancellation of already approved funding for 1,400 research projects violated the First Amendment. In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked. Another lawsuit concerns the termination of the agency’s funding for 56 state and territorial humanities councils, which by law are entitled to a portion of the agency’s funding, which they use to support local projects, including many in rural areas.

On Thursday, the Department of Education announced that Black students received 3 percent of acceptance letters to the eight elite schools, known as specialized high schools, while Hispanic students were offered just under 7 percent of all spots. At Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, the most selective of the specialized schools, eight of the 781 offers this spring went to Black students while 27 went to Hispanic pupils.

The agreement, a copy of which Brown made public, calls for the university to make $50 million in payments to state work force development programs over a decade and requires Brown to comply with the Trump administration’s vision on matters like transgender athletes and “merit-based” admissions policies. The university, which is in Providence, R.I., secured a pledge from the government that the deal would not be used “to dictate Brown’s curriculum or the content of academic speech.” The Trump administration is also required to restore millions of dollars in federal research funding that it had blocked in recent months, and Brown avoided the naming of an independent monitor to oversee the deal.

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and Linda McMahon, the education secretary, sent a letter to Duke administrators on Monday expressing concerns about “racial preferences in hiring, student admissions, governance, patient care, and other operations” in the university’s health care system.

Harvard’s human resources office said Tuesday that it was not “at this time” giving the government access to forms completed by people who were in jobs “only open to students” as it weighed whether an educational privacy law protected those documents. Otherwise, the university said, it “intends to comply with federal law and accordingly will provide the requested records.” Harvard, though, suggested it was surprised by the scale of the request, noting that “the government does not ordinarily ask an employer to disclose all of its employees’ Form I-9s and their supporting materials.” The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are still included, but an important part of modern political history was neatly redacted from the version millions of visitors to Washington would see. The Trump administration, in fact, has made an aggressive effort to rewrite not only its own history but also that of the United States, especially as it is documented in its official museums and cultural artifacts. The order specifically criticized an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum that included an unimpeachable statement that race has been used “to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege and disenfranchisement.” In June he managed to pressure Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, into stepping down after criticizing her support for racial and gender equality.

So on Thursday, Switzerland found itself in the uncomfortable position of facing a 39 percent tariff on its goods in the United States, one of the highest rates in the world. Guy Parmelin, the Swiss economy minister, said at the conference that the country’s industries would be hit hard by the high tariff rate as well as the uncertainty over when and whether it might be reduced. will be effectively annihilated.” The crisis has reignited a longstanding debate in Switzerland over whether to remain independent from the European Union, which faces a 15 percent tariff as part of a deal with Mr. Switzerland already took a step in that direction in June, when the government approved a package agreed upon with the European Union to streamline their trade ties after a decade of thorny negotiations. Georges Kern, the chief executive of the luxury Swiss watch brand Breitling, said in an interview that the company had enough inventory in the United States to last roughly three months. Kern hoped for a trade agreement in the coming weeks, and said Swiss companies “can and will contribute to find a solution with President Trump to address his concerns.” Image During talks with American officials, the Swiss highlighted the major investments that their companies had made in the United States, including the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis. Sedat Suna/Getty Images Pierre-Yves Bonvin, the chief executive Steiger Textil, a Swiss company that makes industrial knitting machines, described the tariffs as a “tsunami.” Swiss businesses had been led by the government to believe that they would face a top tariff of 15 percent, he said, which they could have managed. A Swiss maker of precision cutting tools said his company would start layoffs almost immediately for its small American work force of 10 people because it could not afford to absorb the 39 percent tariff, nor pass the whole price increase onto its American manufacturing customers. The dimming prospects for business in the United States also drove the decision, according to the company’s chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation by Mr. Officials thought they had made a convincing case to their American counterparts to reduce an initial 31 percent tariff threat by highlighting the major investments that Swiss companies have made in the United States, including by the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis.

Now, the Trump administration appears to be floating numbers to see what governments would accept on the “rules of origin.” One such proposal to Thailand recently was whether 70 percent locally made was attainable, according to a senior Thai official involved in trade talks with the United States.

Taken together, the policies amount to a far-reaching crackdown on wind and solar power, which provided 16 percent of the nation’s electricity last year and were two of the fastest-growing sources of power. “These actions are so extreme that one can only hope that they reconsider once they see the impacts here,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers. “This is going to dramatically affect our ability to develop energy in this country.” President Trump has repeatedly expressed his distaste for both renewable energy technologies, calling them ugly and inefficient.

Article: A judge in Charleston, S.C., dismissed on Wednesday the city’s lawsuit against oil and gas companies over their role in climate change, ruling that the case raised questions that were far beyond the bounds of state laws. During two days of hearings in May, lawyers for the city argued that the companies, ranging from giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron to local firms, had covered up what they knew about the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions. Young wrote that while the lawyers argued the claims were about deception, “they are premised on, and seek redress for, the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.” He said that those issues fall squarely under federal and not state law, and that the court lacked jurisdiction over out-of-state companies.

Article: The trilogy recounts how a motley group of friends set out on a journey to destroy the great Ring of Power and defeat the dark Lord Sauron, who intends to use its dreadful magic to rule all of Middle-earth through “force and fear.” The Ring corrupts all who use it, and its story endures as a potent allegory about the corrupting effects of greed and pride and what Tolkien called the evil “lust for domination.” Given the trilogy’s idealistic overtones, it’s easy to understand why the books gained a cult following in the 1970s among hippies and Vietnam War protesters, who embraced its love of nature and rejection of consumer culture, and what they saw as its passionate denunciation of militarism and power politics. It’s more difficult to understand why the trilogy’s most prominent fans today are Silicon Valley tech lords like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and a rising group of far-right politicians in both Europe and the United States. Why do so many of today’s high-profile fans of “The Lord of the Rings” and other fantasy and sci-fi classics insist on turning these cautionary tales into aspirational road maps for mastering the universe? Some of the answers lie in the sheer popularity of the trilogy, which has sold more than 150 million copies across the world and permeated the public imagination, as genre fiction has moved from the margins to the mainstream.

Article: And this time, I not only passed out, but I vomited and had to be brought back with smelling salts, which — Casey, if you have never experienced smelling salts, they’re not messing around. But it is one of the most amazing, crazy experiences you can have in the human — do you know what I mean, the moment when your consciousness just leaves you? kevin roose And because we are going to talk about OpenAI, I should add my disclosure that The New York Times Company is suing them and Microsoft for copyright violations. So I actually thought it was cool that he said that because now we have one thing to hang on to where well, maybe when a model can do that, we’ll feel like we really are getting close to AGI. But the one other thing that he said that struck me that I thought was kind of funny was that he said that after they had put GPT-5 together, he went back to using GPT-4. So I do think it’s really notable now that even free users, which I think is going to include a lot of high school and college students out there, are now going to have access to what, at least they are saying, is PhD level intelligence and reasoning. But for GPT-5, OpenAI is doing away with the model picker, or at least making it less necessary because they have built this, what they called a router that will essentially analyze your request, and how much computation it needs to be able to answer that request, and whether it’s a simple query or something more involved. And I think for a lot of people, this is going to be their first experience with a reasoning model because OpenAI does not make that the default right now in ChatGPT. On the other hand, I do feel like it sets up an incentive for OpenAI, which wants to save as much money as it can to just always try to route you to the absolute least compute that you need. And so I will just be curious to see if I feel like that is affecting the quality of my experience now that maybe can’t go in and actually say, hey, let me use the good stuff. And that might be a good point to bring up two of the questions that got asked of the GPT-5 team during the briefing that were on the — that I think would be of interest to our listeners. I mean, I wonder if they are starting to finesse their definitions of the scaling laws to account for the new reasoning models because people, for months now, have been saying, well, the models in the pre-training phase may have gotten as good as they’re going to get or about as good as they’re going to get. And all of the labs have had experiences where they thought they were training a new model and then it didn’t quite work out as well as they wanted it to and so they assign it some lower number, that’s happened at least a number of big labs that I know about. To me, that is one of the most interesting things about this release is whatever GPT-5 turns out to be, this is the thing that they thought was the next big step forward. And I think it was reasonable to expect, and I certainly expected that in the wake of all that, they would slow down and maybe allow some competitors to catch up. And I think one thing I’ll have my eye on over the next several months is, are they able to continue iterating very quickly or have some of the losses that they’ve experienced over the past few weeks really hurt them? And I think in particular, if you are a free user of ChatGPT, you’re going to have a great day because for the first time now, in addition to standard ChatGPT model, you’re going to have some reasoning capability. I mean, the way I saw people talking about it online was that they thought that OpenAI had not raised the ceiling of the AI frontier by a lot with GPT-5, but they had raised the floor, essentially. What makes that figure interesting, I think, Kevin, is that that number is a lot smaller than Anthropic’s Claude for Opus API, which comes in at $15 per million input tokens. So I think some of these really well capitalized AI labs are taking this moment to say, hey, we’re going to put a lot of pricing pressure on some of our competitors. In fact, some people are posting online screenshots of some prediction markets that until today, when asked, who do you think will have the most powerful AI model at the end of August, were showing OpenAI in the lead. So I don’t want to overstate what that means necessarily, but it does seem like there was a huge contingent of people who thought that GPT-5 was going to be this revolutionary new model. One of them is that The New York Times Company has recently agreed to a licensing deal with Amazon that will allow Amazon access to “Times” content for its AI platforms, including Alexa. The second thing we should say is that if you have an Alexa device, it is going to be going off constantly during this segment, unless you go over right now and hit the little button that mutes it. And I use zero of them because the three things that I use Alexa for are setting timers, choosing music to play in my house, and telling me the weather before I leave for the day. But when generative AI started to get good a couple years ago, I think people naturally started to ask, well, when is Alexa going to start using this new generative AI technology? But it seemed like a natural thing to expect that Alexa would start to incorporate some of this technology to be able to answer maybe more open-ended questions, to give longer, more detailed responses, to do more than just set timers and tell you the weather. I mean, once OpenAI released voice mode for ChatGPT, it just immediately seemed so much more interesting and powerful than Alexa and Siri, which is Apple’s very similar system that it makes for its devices. And so yeah, I think both of us were like, OK, well, when are we going to get that OpenAI style voice mode in these smart devices that we have in our homes? And part of what I’m so excited to talk with Daniel Rausch, the VP of Alexa, about later in this show, is just why it’s been so hard to shove an LLM-based generative AI technology into this pre-existing assistant product. But we should just talk briefly about what Alexa+ is and then our experiences with it because both you and I have gotten to try this over the past few days. We don’t know exactly which model or models, but it seems to be a mix of Amazon’s proprietary AI models and then maybe some of Claude, which it has a deal with Anthropic. The other big difference I noticed right away is that the new Alexa+ does not require you to say the wake word, like Alexa, between every question and answer pair. And then you can just say, order me an Uber from this place to this place, or I want a table at a restaurant in downtown San Francisco near the Ferry Building for two people at 6:30 tomorrow. And it was just this forever — and so I eventually just unplugged the thing because I was like, why did I just spend $90 to have a permanent rotating advertisement for household products on my desk? Now, there are a lot of things I’m willing to do for a podcast, but mount an Echo Show on my wall — kevin roose You’re not willing to do a construction project. And it’s like, this — and right here, we have just landed in the exact spot that has been bedeviling Apple for the last year, that is bedeviling Alexa right now. And after two days of ads for paper towels and one day of I’m not going to show you the lemon pasta, I thought, what am I doing with my life? kevin roose So the new Alexa+ update seems to have broken Alexa’s ability to reliably set and cancel alarms, which is a core thing that I use this product for. And so for example, this morning, I woke up on my own a little bit earlier than my alarm, like, 10 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off. And one of the things it said was, I can help you explore Gen Z music trends, which there was just something funny about the way it said it to me. But now you’re trying to sell me Amazon Music, which I feel like is very consistent with how Alexa+ handles everything, which is, could we sell you a service right now? Two, I’m very confident that lots of other people are probably having much better experiences with this thing because I think if most people were having experiences as bad as me, I just would have heard about this before now. But I think my overall impression is that the Alexa+ that you have now in this early access program, it is a little like having a kind of GPT-3.5 class model inside of a smart speaker, which I think is a valuable thing and one that I would like them to continue to build on. casey newton I think the most powerful thing that the Alexa+ has done for me is it has made me forgive Apple for not shipping anything with the new Siri. I think what’s happening with Alexa and Siri right now is sort of a — it’s like a symbol of what’s happening in the American economy writ large, which is we are trying to jam these new AI technologies into these legacy systems and processes. I also just think that when I’m using a chatbot on my laptop and it gives me something that’s 80 percent or 85 percent right, that’s much more useful to me than an Alexa response that’s 85 percent right because a chatbot setting, I can just take what I need. But really, it’s a complete re-architecture of everything that you would say Alexa is from the way you have a conversation and engage with the experience at a very basic level all the way through Alexa acknowledging you or just maintaining a chat. I think it’s fair to say we both had some things that impressed us about the new Alexa+ and some things that were challenging, including some of the basic stuff that Alexa seemed to be very good at before, or at least that I know how to get reliable performance out of Alexa for that no longer seem to work as well. Because back in 2023, when Amazon announced that it was going to revamp Alexa, give it this brain upgrade with these new AI capabilities, they said this was going to be ready in 2024. If you go back to 2023 and the models that were available then, the state of the art, very little instruction following reasoning, low ability to execute on these interfaces with other systems, we announced something called Let’s Chat, which was a mode of Alexa. So think about flipping a switch on Alexa and turning on a chat interface so that you can do some basic question and answer and have a discussion about a topic, mostly about knowledge native to the model’s training data versus bringing something in at runtime the way that modern chatbots answer questions by going out on the internet. I think as all of us know, you sit there and fiddle with a chatbot long enough to press it into being smarmy or responding in ways that we don’t believe are the way Alexa might act, for example, or press it to give you wrong information that’s from some unauthoritative source or a mistake in its training data online, shifts back to its native training. Personalizing an experience of this depth so that Alexa is always learning from her interactions with you and extending your interactions so they get more delightful over time, I think this is something you probably wouldn’t have seen in a weekend’s worth of fiddling with the experience. And I think if you rewind the tape to 2023, it’s really about learning how big a project Alexa+ would be and then starting to put one foot in front of the other, really inventing the space of creating those integrations because it just hasn’t been done. But the amount of work that went into just the interface between a large language model and the downstream systems that complete tasks is — I mean, it’s the biggest body of work that we’ve put in. And it would be too much to even try — without a whiteboard here, it would be too much to even try to explain to you and your listeners, I think, the technical depth that went into it. There was a former machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, Mihail Eric, who did a long post on X last year, sort of his version of a postmortem or retrospective on what was happening with Alexa. And he wrote that Amazon had, quote, “all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.” But then he said that Amazon and Alexa had fumbled the ball because Alexa was, quote, “riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.” He made it seem like the problem was not just that the technology was an uneasy fit, but that there were also some organizational and bureaucracy problems that had to be solved. But I do think the team is inspired by the vision, executing at an unbelievable pace and really creating a lot of invention because there are a lot of really hard problems. This is a company that has offered a lot of AI models through AWS, big market share in cloud-based AI, also recently started an AGI lab at Amazon that is going to be pushing towards something like an artificial general intelligence. daniel rausch I would say we do believe — and I share this belief, the leadership team at Amazon has, that this generation of generative AI is going to transform every customer experience we have. So if you look at the scale and scope of what Amazon does and assume our belief that every experience will be transformed with generative AI, it’s as big as Amazon is at that point. To be as productive as you can be in this day and age and get as much done for customers as we aspire to, you have to build AI into how you’re working. On the 5, my first observation was that after I told it I would like to see art, I feel like every time I looked over at it, it was asking me if I wanted to buy paper towels or Advil something. But I felt like the Alexa+ AI thinks of me primarily as a person who might send more money to Amazon if you just gave me a few more ideas for how I might do that. But I do think it comes across as a kind of insecurity in the device like, if we’re not constantly showing you everything that we’ve built into this thing, you’ll never discover it. One of my most delightful — we have a new LLM called For You, which is a place where we post little notifications about things we think you might be interested in. And I had been helping my daughter study the periodic table for part of her chemistry final, and I was never great at remembering, in particular, the elements that you need a mnemonic for, like lead. kevin roose To piggyback on Casey’s question, I think this is one of the big questions about the Alexa business model is whether you see this as something that is going to make money on its own or whether this is primarily a way of increasing the amount of money that people spend on Amazon. And putting it into Prime brings together both all of a customers’ Prime benefits because you might watch a video, or listen to a song from Amazon Music, or use your Amazon Photos benefit, which is awesome with an Echo Show and review your family photos. So some of the more complicated stuff that I tried with Alexa+, such as setting up routines that involve multiple steps such as emailing documents or research papers to the Alexa email address and trying to have it summarize these things, these things just didn’t work for me. What I found more frustrating that I wanted to ask you about, because I’m actually not sure why this happens, was that some of the basic features that Alexa had previously been good at and reliable at for me were less reliable with Alexa+.

Article: This is “The Daily.” After rolling back a slew of regulations aimed at reversing climate change and pulling funding for the scientists who monitor it, the Trump administration is now taking its boldest action yet. On Tuesday, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, traveled to Indianapolis to a truck dealership to make what he called one of the most significant acts of deregulation in American history. But the endangerment finding is the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases in the United States, from automobiles, from power plants, from oil and gas wells, and more. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Massachusetts versus EPA that greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, others are pollutants and that the EPA can regulate them if they pose a danger to human health and welfare. And taking you back to that time, 2008, the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top scientific body, had just recently established the most comprehensive set of information to that date on establishing that climate change is caused by human activities and the dangers that it poses. It went through findings that US scientists under the Bush administration had compiled about the threats of climate change, everything from the way that increased and more intense wildfires and the smoke from wildfires affects human health to the increases in regional ozone pollution that are exacerbated by climate change. And based on this evidence, the Obama administration determined pretty conclusively see that climate change and the emissions that are furthering climate change cause a danger to human health and welfare. [APPLAUSE] lisa friedman That was an effort to reduce emissions from the utility sector, from power plants in the United States, reducing methane from leaks from oil and gas wells, restrictions on automobile tailpipe emissions. And we and others reported that the EPA at that time made the decision that it was not a legal fight that it could win, and it wasn’t a science fight that they felt they could win. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Interestingly, and I think this dynamic still holds, the business community that back in 2009 had been so worried about the endangerment finding by 2016 had really lost an appetite for fighting it. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Lisa, before President Trump returns to office this year and targets this endangerment finding, in the middle of his two terms, of course, we have President Biden, who, it seems worth briefly mentioning, makes regulating climate change a very big priority and gets a lot done on that front. And so the Biden presidency feels like a reinforcement of this idea that the overall arc of where the United States is going is this journey toward regulating emissions and trying to use the government to reduce them. Because through the course of Obama, Trump, and Biden, as much as the first Trump administration promoted fossil fuels, weakened regulations, they never attacked this fundamental understanding, which, like you said, has really become, by this stage, kind of embedded — that climate change is real. But the EPA is making a series of arguments and alternative arguments, what one legal scholar described to me as throwing a bunch of spaghetti to see what sticks with a court. One other thing they argue is that even if the endangerment finding stayed in place, they’re saying that the EPA shouldn’t set standards on greenhouse gas emissions because no matter what technology we apply, we can’t make a dent in the problem of global climate change. michael barbaro Putting aside those legal arguments, I’m curious why, in your reporting, you have found that the White House has decided to go after a finding that, as you have explained very clearly in this conversation, the industry doesn’t really want anymore. And so what Trump is doing in moving to repeal this is really satisfying a request to pull, root and stem, the ability to regulate climate change from the government. michael barbaro It feels, upon reflection, like getting rid of the endangerment finding bookends two very different moments in the climate change conversation in the United States — when it was created back in the Obama presidency and now that it’s coming down. But I think you still see that the majority of Americans — and the Pew polls and others show this — acknowledge climate change, are concerned about climate change, and want the government to take some kind of action — that there is a lot of dispute about. lisa friedman I think when the dust clears on this legal fight — and there will be a big legal fight after the repeal of the endangerment is finalized — I think the question is going to come back to Congress. michael barbaro Not which executive actions stay or get removed and toggle back and forth, but whether the legislative branch ever decides that this is something that it wants to tackle. When Congress failed to pass a big climate law — at the time, it was called cap and trade — he gave a speech where he said, if Congress doesn’t act, I will.

Article: michael barbaro I think we’re going to call — yeah, I think we’re going to call you back on a — for the first time in a really long time — a landline. This is “The Daily.” Today’s total solar eclipse will be watched by millions of people across North America, none of them as closely as Fred Espenak, a longtime NASA scientist who’s devoted his entire life to studying, chasing, and popularizing the wonder that is an eclipse. And I made a promise to myself that I was going to get to that eclipse in 1970 to see it because I thought it was a one chance in a lifetime to see a total eclipse of the sun. And I was amazed that outside the back of the motel, in this grassy field, there were dozens and dozens of people with telescopes out there, specifically there for the eclipse that morning. It’s really only in the last 10 minutes or so that you start to notice changes in the environment because now enough of the sun has been covered, upwards of maybe 90 percent of the sun. fred espenak Well, I think, when you see this all transpire, you can easily understand how people thought this was the end of the world because it seems far outside of the realms of nature. You almost get a three-dimensional sense of the motions of the Earth and the moon around the sun when you see this clockwork displayed right in front of you, this mechanics of the eclipse taking place. And I realized, well, I’ve got to expand my outlook on what’s an acceptable distance to travel to see a total eclipse because the next total eclipse then, in 1973, was through the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. michael barbaro And if you’ll permit me a question that might seem maybe dopey to someone in your field, after you’ve seen one or two or three of these, do they start to blend in together and become a little bit the same? fred espenak So I went to grad school at University of Toledo and did some work at Kitt Peak National Observatory, learning the ins and outs of photometric photometry — that is, measuring the brightness of stars. fred espenak Well, I’ve seen total eclipses from Australia, from Africa, from the Altiplanos in Bolivia, from the ice sheet on the coast of Antarctica, and even from Northern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. [bonnie tyler, "total eclipse of the heart"] Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart fred espenak Of course, we had “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” It was a must-have. fred espenak Well, the eclipses are like benchmarks that I can use to figure out what else was going on in my life during these times, because I remember the dates of every single eclipse I’ve been to. It reminds me of when Pat and I got married and between which eclipse we were getting married and had to plan our wedding so it didn’t interfere with any kind of eclipse trips. But I think, for the rest of us — and here, I’m thinking about myself — this is really going to be my first total eclipse, at least that I can remember. And given the hard-earned wisdom that you’ve accumulated in all your decades of chasing eclipses around the world, I wonder if you can give us just a little bit of advice for how to best live inside this very brief window of a total solar eclipse, to make sure, not to be cliche, but that we make it count. fred espenak Well, I think one mistake that people tend to make is getting preoccupied with recording everything in their lives, what they had for lunch, what they had for dinner.

But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that’s clear.” The tragic death of Diogo Jota, in a car crash in Spain in July, supersedes all concerns of success. Coming to terms with his loss will be painful in training and in matches, with his absence felt in ways far beyond the gap the Portuguese forward leaves in the starting XI each week. Arsenal Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal have been the form team of the last three seasons in the Premier League, but three second-place finishes in a row are starting to burn deeply in north London. Enzo Maresca’s side stormed to a 3-0 win against the Parisians, who swept through the UEFA Champions League – culminating in their own 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan – to complete the treble. Whether Maresca can continue to tie the team together following the CWC triumph, and whether that tournament will test the legs of the Blues players later in the season, could well be deciding factors in Chelsea’s title challenge. Or will the light blues of Manchester continue to feel the heavy burden of a side that conquered all before them, only to seemingly lose control of their own success last season? The injury to Ballon d’Or holder Rodri undoubtedly hit City hard last term, and the news that he will miss the start of the new campaign will also come as a huge concern to Guardiola. For a team that won an unprecedented five trophies in 2023, and the record-setting Premier League title the following year, to fall so far last season came as a huge shock to all, not least their manager. The Blues also crashed out of the Champions League and League Cup early, and their FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace meant no silverware for the first time in eight years. The summer spree pushed City’s spending for 2025 past the 300-million-pounds ($403.5m) mark, following the arrivals of Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico Gonzalez and Vitor Reis in the January window. We want to try and do better than last season, especially with consistency.” A cloud that continues to hang over the club, however, is that they still face 115 charges of breaking Premier League financial regulations. Manchester United and the rest United have defied their financial woes to reinvent their front three with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo signed earlier in the window, and the big-money move for Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Just like Guardiola, his opposite number across the Manchester divide, how long the reversal in fortunes takes is likely to take will define how much longer Amorim has at the helm. Aston Villa were another side that have threatened to break into the Premier League’s elite, having secured Champions League football two years ago, which resulted in a run to the quarterfinals last year. If the transfer merry-go-round continues, however, then Villa striker Ollie Watkins could be the next on the move, with all of last season’s top four having been linked with a move for the England international at some stage.

Article: Iran has said it will block a corridor planned in the Caucasus under a United States-brokered peace accord between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which has been hailed by other countries in the region as beneficial for achieving lasting peace. Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Saturday that Tehran would block the initiative “with or without Russia”, with which Iran has a strategic alliance alongside Armenia. US President Donald Trump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News, referring to the transport corridor included in the peace deal. The terms of the accord, which was unveiled at a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday, include exclusive US development rights to a route through Armenia that would link Azerbaijan to Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave that borders Baku’s ally Turkiye. Advertisement While it welcomed the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ministry said any project near Iran’s borders should be developed “with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and without foreign interference”. For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautiously welcomed the deal, saying on Saturday that Moscow supported efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the region, including the Washington meeting. “The involvement of non-regional players should strengthen the peace agenda, not create new divisions,” the ministry said, adding that it hoped to avoid the “unfortunate experience” of Western-led conflict resolution in the Middle East. A NATO member, Turkiye has strongly backed Azerbaijan in its conflicts with Armenia, but has pledged to restore ties with Yerevan after it signs a final peace deal with Baku. The Turkish presidency said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the peace agreement with Ilham Aliyev, his counterpart from Azerbaijan, and offered Ankara’s support in achieving lasting peace in the region. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also addressed the planned corridor during a visit to Egypt, saying it could “link Europe with the depths of Asia via Turkiye” and would be “a very beneficial development”. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Ahmad Shahidov, of the Azerbaijan Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected a final peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan to be signed in the coming weeks.

Article: The international community must “shoulder its responsibility” and take action against Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the Palestinian foreign affairs minister has told Al Jazeera before an emergency United Nations Security Council session. In an interview on Saturday, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin said the 15-member council must uphold international law when it convenes at UN headquarters in New York on Sunday to discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip. “What has been going in Palestine for the last 22 months is nothing but a genocide, and it’s part and parcel of Israel’s expansionist ideology that wants to take over the entirety of the occupied State of Palestine.” The Israeli security cabinet approved plans this week to seize Gaza City, forcibly displacing nearly one million Palestinians to concentration zones in the south of the bombarded coastal enclave. Palestinians have rejected the Israeli push to force them out of the city while human rights groups and the UN have warned that the plan will worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and lead to further mass casualties. Aghabekian Shahin told Al Jazeera that if Trump – whose administration continues to provide unwavering diplomatic and military support to Israel – wants to reach a solution, Palestinian rights must be taken into account. “There will be no peace in Israel-Palestine, or the region for that matter, or even the world at large, if the rights of the Palestinians are not respected,” she said, noting that this means a Palestinian state must be established. In a social media post on Friday, Netanyahu said he wants “a peaceful civilian administration” to be established in the enclave, “one that is not the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, and not any other terrorist organization”. “If Gaza wants to come back to the core, which is the entirety of the Palestinian land, then it has to become under the control and governance of the Palestinian Authority, the PLO.” Aghabekian Shahin also condemned the international community for failing to act as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a surge in Israeli military and settler attacks in the shadow of the country’s war on Gaza. “It is the inaction that has emboldened the Israelis, including the settlers, to do whatever they are doing for the last six decades, since day one of the 1967 occupation,” she said.

The arrests are the latest at a series of protests denouncing the government’s ban on Palestine Action, a move critics say infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest, as well as aims to stifle demonstrations against Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. Reporting from Parliament Square on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego said the threat of arrest or punishment “hasn’t deterred any supporters” of Palestine Action from expressing their backing for the group. “We’re now living in an alternative universe and I’m not going to accept it.” ‘Campaign of defiance’ In advance of Saturday’s protest, more than 200 people had been detained in a wave of demonstrations across the UK denouncing the ban since it came into force in July. More than 350 academics from around the world signed onto an open letter this week applauding a “growing campaign of collective defiance” against the decision by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to proscribe Palestine Action. The signatories “deplore the repressive consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond”, the letter read.

Article: Gaza’s Ministry of Health said on Saturday that the total number of malnutrition deaths has reached 212, including 98 children, since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023. Most of the deaths have occurred in recent weeks as Israel continues to impose severe restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza after partially lifting a total blockade in late May. On Friday, the World Food Programme (WFP) called on Israel to allow the delivery of at least 100 aid trucks per day to Gaza, noting that only 60 of its aid truck drivers have been vetted and approved by the Israeli military to date. The 100 trucks per day the organisation called for is a fraction of the 600 per day other United Nations agencies and Gaza authorities have said are needed to meet the basic needs of Gaza residents. “Convoy movements are frequently hampered by last-minute changes by Israeli authorities, and heavy insecurity due to military activities along convoy routes.” In its latest statement on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, noted that it has not been allowed to bring any humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food and medicine, for more than five months, depriving hungry and ailing Palestinians of what they need to survive. Advertisement UNRWA has been calling on Israel to lift its siege on Gaza, saying the ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid from several countries “are very expensive and ineffective” at reaching those urgently in need. ‘No one and nowhere is safe’ As the death toll continues to soar, international condemnation of Israel’s conduct in the war is growing, with several countries raising alarm over Israel’s plans to seize Gaza City in an operation that could forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to concentration zones in southern Gaza. “People are wondering what’s going to happen to them, what’s going to be left of Gaza if Israel moves on with its approved plan to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza City,” he said. Speaking at a joint news conference in El Alamein with his Egyptian counterpart after meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Fidan said members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had been called to an emergency meeting to tackle the crisis.

Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh made the announcement on Saturday, weeks after India’s military acknowledged that an unspecified number of its own jets were also shot down by Pakistan during their heaviest fighting in decades. “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed and one large aircraft,” Singh said at a military lecture in the southern city of Bengaluru, adding that the large aircraft, which could have been a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300km (186 miles). “If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification – though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in a social media post. “Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment.” Singh, the Indian air force chief, did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed but said air strikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F-16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two airbases in southeastern Pakistan.

Kennedy is known for his vaccine scepticism and recently ousted all 17 members of a scientific advisory panel on vaccines at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be replaced with his own selections. However, this latest announcement is just part of a series of moves by President Donald Trump himself that appear to target the vaccine industry and give increasing weight to the arguments of vaccine sceptics in the US. “My main concern is that this is part of an increasingly ideological rather than evidence-based approach to healthcare and vaccination in particular that is being adopted in the US,” David Elliman, associate professor at University College London, told Al Jazeera. The main reason, he said, was that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had reviewed mRNA vaccines and found them to be “ineffective” in fighting mutating viruses. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts, … HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” Instead, Kennedy said, the US will shift mRNA funding to other vaccine development technologies that are “safer” and “remain effective”. Some notable institutions and companies that will be affected by the latest decision, as listed on the HHS website, include: Emory University and Tiba Biotech (terminated contracts) Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus (rejected or cancelled proposals) Luminary Labs, ModeX (“descoped” or weakened contracts) AstraZeneca and Moderna (“restructured” contracts) What are mRNA vaccines, and are they really ineffective against virus mutations? “The technology has great promise for vaccines and therapeutics, so ceasing research in the field without good evidence is unjustified.” The move, he added, could discourage investors and scientists, both inside and outside the US, from keeping up research. At the least, there should be notice and an opportunity for hearing and explanation under our administrative law, and there was instead a short and cursory X video with no references, no real data,” she said. In another 2023 podcast, Kennedy said, “No vaccine is safe or effective.” Aside from his vaccine scepticism, Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, has also made several controversial remarks about other health issues, such as COVID-19. We’re giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children.” In subsequent interviews, Trump called childhood vaccines a “monster shot” and in 2015 during a debate among Republican presidential candidates said vaccines were “meant for a horse, not a child”. Advertisement Additionally, in his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration initially downplayed the virus, but it ultimately oversaw the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines in a project it called Operation Warp Speed. In May, Kennedy announced that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women without giving details about the reasons behind the change in policy. In May, the FDA approved Novavax’s non-mRNA, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine although only for older adults and those over the age of 12 who also have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk from the virus. The 2026 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), a public-private entity formed in 2002 to support vaccine distribution to low and middle-income countries. GAVI was instrumental in securing vaccines for several countries in Africa and other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was feared that richer countries could stockpile the available doses. Trump’s health budget proposals in 2018 and subsequently proposed budget cuts to the National Institute of Health and the CDC would have impacted immunisation programmes and a wide range of life-saving research on vaccines.

Article: “I cannot wait to start learning from [manager] Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.” Manchester United, who finished 15th in the Premier League last season, have also signed forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for the new campaign, which starts at home against Arsenal on August 17. Advertisement “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football,” Jason Wilcox, Man United’s director of football, said in the club’s announcement. “The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United, as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.” Current United strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored just 18 goals between them in all competitions last term as United fell to a club-record 18 losses in the Premier League era and its lowest points total of 42. Only four teams scored fewer goals than United in the top flight last term – including the three relegated clubs – as the 20-time English champion recorded its lowest finish in the modern era when it placed 15th, just three places above the relegation zone. Sesko has been compared with former Paris Saint-Germain and United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic because of his height – both are 1.95 metres (6 feet, 5 inches) tall – and flashes of technical skill.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ruled out ceding land to Russia and demanded his country take part in negotiations aimed at ending the war between the neighbours, just days before planned talks between the leaders of Russia and the United States. In a video shared on social media on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for “real decisions” that could bring a “dignified peace” but stressed there could be no violation of the constitution on territorial issues. His comments came hours after US President Donald Trump said a peace deal would involve “some swapping of territories” as he announced a meeting on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the US state of Alaska to discuss the war. Advertisement Previously, the Kremlin has insisted that Ukraine give up the territories Russia occupies, and that Western nations stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and exclude the country from membership in the NATO military alliance. “There has been a lot of speculation over what a ceasefire agreement could look like in which the lines of contact between Russia and Ukraine could be frozen for a number of years,” Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javad reported from Moscow. “It is also not clear whether the Russian demand that NATO’s ambitions in Ukraine should be forever quashed is actually going to be met.” Separately on Saturday, Zelenskyy spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and urged Ukraine’s allies to take “clear steps” towards achieving a sustainable peace. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake.” Meanwhile, national security advisers from Ukrainian allies – including the US, European Union nations and the UK – gathered in Britain on Saturday to align their views ahead of the Putin-Trump summit. Ukraine and its European allies have long opposed any agreement that involves ceding occupied territory, but Putin has repeatedly said any deal must require Ukraine to relinquish some of the territories Russia has seized. Russia declared four Ukrainian regions that it does not fully control – Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Luhansk – its territory in 2022 and also claims the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Advertisement “We have a lot of hope that Trump will make Putin accept a real negotiation and a ceasefire to the conflict,” said Goncharenko, adding that the outcome of the war in Ukraine is crucial for Europe’s security, as well as that of his own country. “I think Europe is clearly on our side and Trump should [keep] Europe on its side.” Meanwhile, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov has said the talks between Putin and Trump next week will “focus on discussing options for achieving a long-term peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian crisis”.

Article: Midfielder Rodri is recovering from a “big injury” sustained during the Club World Cup, likely limiting the Ballon d’Or winner’s playing time in the early stages of the new Premier League season, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says. Guardiola did not disclose the details of the injury but said the 29-year-old Spain international picked up the problem during City’s 4-3 loss against the Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in the round of 16 of the Club World Cup in July. “Rodri is getting better, but he had a big injury in the last game against Al Hilal,” Guardiola told reporters on Friday before Saturday’s friendly match against the Italian side Palermo. “Hopefully in these [first three Premier League] games, he can play some minutes, but what is important is that he doesn’t have pain because we don’t want Rodri coming back injured. “He has been training the last two sessions with us, and that’s good.” City, who finished third last season, begin their Premier League campaign away against Wolverhampton Wanderers on August 16.

More than 200 firefighters backed by 11 water bombers and seven helicopters were deployed to battle the Keratea blaze, Costas Tsigkas, head of the association of Greek firefighter officers, told ERT state television. “The woman fell in the water and the man apparently tried to save her.” The national weather service EMY said winds of up to 74 kilometres per hour (46 miles per hour) were forecast for Saturday, and the civil protection ministry placed several areas under the highest alert for wildfires, including the Attica region, which includes Athens.

Article: Judge Emmanuel Baguma said on Friday that the 180-day maximum period before mandatory bail is granted only began when he was remanded in the civilian court on February 21, which means he falls short by 12 days to meet the requirements to secure bail. The case has raised concerns among government critics, including opposition leader Bobi Wine and rights groups, about a crackdown ahead of Uganda’s national election early next year in which President Yoweri Museveni, 80, is seeking re-election. Besigye, who denies any wrongdoing, was forcefully returned to Uganda from neighbouring Kenya in November last year, and initially charged in a military tribunal, before his case was transferred to a civilian court.

Article: Peter Safar, an Austrian doctor, had just developed the basics of CPR, a lifesaving technique that keeps blood and oxygen flowing to the brain and vital organs after the heart has stopped beating. The Norwegian toymaker had a vision: It needed to look unthreatening, and assuming that men would not want to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a male dummy, it should be a woman. There are many rumours as to how the original mask was created, but one story that has cemented itself as urban legend is that it was of a woman who had supposedly drowned in the Seine River in 19th-century Paris. In the French capital at the time, it was common for the bodies of the deceased who could not be identified to be placed on black marble slabs and displayed in the window of the city’s morgue situated near Notre Dame Cathedral. The French writer Albert Camus called her the “drowned Mona Lisa”, while the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke said of her serene expression, “It was beautiful, because it smiled, because it smiled so deceptively, as if it knew.” Resusci Anne It is not known whether Laderdal was aware of the legend behind the painting in Stavanger, but in 1960, he gave it new life when the first CPR doll was officially launched with the subject’s face. As the story goes, the superstar heard the phrase during a first aid training session and, struck by the rhythm and urgency of it, worked it into the chart-topping song, Smooth Criminal, repeating it like a heartbeat: “Annie, are you OK? Are you OK, Annie?” ‘She would be proud’ Laerdal died in 1981, but the company he founded, Laerdal Medical, continues to be a juggernaut in emergency medical training and the development of cutting-edge healthcare technology. Pal Oftedal, director of Corporate Communications at Laerdal Medical, says that regardless of whether the story behind Annie is true, she has had a positive impact on engaging people worldwide in the lifesaving practice of CPR.

Article: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signed into law a bill easing environmental licensing rules, but bowed to pressure from activist groups as he vetoed key provisions that would have made it easier for companies to secure environmental permits. Lula approved on Friday what detractors have dubbed the “devastation bill”, but struck down or altered 63 of its nearly 400 articles, his office’s executive secretary, Miriam Belchior, told reporters. The president had faced mounting pressure from environmental groups to intervene in the bill, which was backed by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and focused on rolling back strict licensing rules that had kept the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in check. Lula’s environmental vetoes Of the provisions struck down by Lula, 26 were vetoed outright, while another 37 will either be replaced with alternative text or modified in a new bill that will be sent to Congress for ratification under a constitutional urgency procedure. Lawmakers aligned with embattled ex-president Jair Bolsonaro are also blocking legislative activity amid an escalating political standoff, as they call for the former president’s charges around an alleged failed coup attempt in 2022 to be dropped. Speaking at a Friday news conference in the capital, Brasilia, Environment Minister Marina Silva maintained a positive tone, telling reporters that Lula’s vetoes would ensure that “the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation”. Silva said a previous version of the bill, approved by Congress last month, threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework. But, she said, Lula’s revised version meant Brazil’s “targets to reach zero deforestation” and its goal to “cut CO2 emissions by between 59 percent and 67 percent remain fully on track”.

Article: But even as the ban was followed by police raids on several bookstores in the region’s biggest city, Srinagar, during which they seized books on the blacklist, Indian officials are holding a book festival in the city on the banks of Dal Lake. “Nothing is surprising about this ban, which comes at a moment when the level of censorship and surveillance in Kashmir since 2019 has reached absurd heights,” Kanjwal told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s crackdown on the region since it revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status six years ago. “It is, of course, even more absurd that this ban comes at a time when the Indian army is simultaneously promoting book reading and literature through a state-sponsored Chinar Book Festival.” Yet even with Kashmir’s long history of facing censorship, the book bans represent to many critics a particularly sweeping attempt by New Delhi to assert control over academia in the disputed region. ‘Misguiding youth’ The 25 books banned by the government offer a detailed overview of the events surrounding the Partition of India and the reasons why Kashmir became such an intransigent territorial dispute to begin with. Advertisement They include writings like Azadi by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy, Human Rights Violations in Kashmir by Piotr Balcerowicz and Agnieszka Kuszewska, Kashmiris’ Fight for Freedom by Mohd Yusaf Saraf, Kashmir Politics and Plebiscite by Abdul Gockhami Jabbar and Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? Then there are books like Kanjwal’s, journalist Anuradha Bhasin’s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 and legal scholar AG Noorani’s The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012, which dissect the region’s political journey over the decades. The government’s order states: “This literature would deeply impact the psyche of youth by promoting a culture of grievance, victimhood, and terrorist heroism.” The dispute in Kashmir dates back to 1947 when the departing British cleaved the Indian subcontinent into the two dominions of India and Pakistan. Muslim-majority Kashmir’s Hindu king sought to be independent of both, but after Pakistan-backed fighters entered a part of the region, he agreed to join India on the condition that Kashmir enjoy a special status within the new union with some autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. Some of Nehru’s decisions that have come under criticism include the unceremonious dismissal of the region’s leader Sheikh Abdullah, who advocated for self-rule for Kashmir, and the decision to replace him with his lieutenant, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, whose 10 years in office were marked by the strengthening of New Delhi’s rule of Indian-administered Kashmir. In 2010, after major protests broke out following the killing of 17-year-old student Tufail Mattoo by security forces, the provincial government banned SMS services and restored them only three years later. At the height of another civil uprising in 2016, the government stopped Kashmir Reader, an independent publication in Srinagar, from going to press, citing its purported “tendency to incite violence”. “First they came for journalists, and realising they were successful in silencing them, they have turned their attention to academia,” said veteran editor Anuradha Bhasin, whose book on India’s revocation of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 is among those banned. “When my book went to print, the legal team vetted it thrice.” ‘A feeling of despair’ The book bans have drawn criticism from various quarters in Kashmir with students and researchers calling it an attempt to impose collective amnesia. “If these works are no longer available to me, my research is naturally going to be lopsided.” On Thursday, videos showed uniformed policemen entering bookstores in Srinagar and asking their proprietors if they possessed any of the books in the banned list. More acclaimed works on the blacklist Historian Sumantra Bose is aghast at the suggestion by Indian authorities that his book Kashmir at the Crossroads has fuelled violence in the region. In 1935, the colonial authorities in British India banned The Indian Struggle, 1920-1934, a compendium of political analysis authored by Subhas Chandra Bose, his great-uncle and a leader of India’s freedom struggle.

Article: While Singapore will bask in some success this weekend, once the flags are taken down and the SG60 merchandise is removed from the shelves, the island-nation will get back to work and begin contemplating its future. Plans are already in motion to continue Singapore’s growth, with its most famous landmark – Marina Bay Sands – set to house a new fourth tower of hotel rooms in 2029, while a 15,000-seat indoor arena will also be built at the site. “If it flooded a lot of the infrastructure in Singapore, closing down MRTs [mass rapid transit], shutting down emergency routes, flooding a power station and the electricity went down – Singapore would be crippled,” Horton said. “The resulting strain will not only test the resilience of healthcare institutions but also place significant emotional, physical, and financial pressure on family caregivers,” said Chuan De Foo, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The fertility rate, which measures the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, fell below 1.0 for the first time in 2023 and shows little sign of increasing. Kalpana Vignehsa, a senior research fellow at NUS’s Institute of Policy Studies think tank, said the Singapore government is “swimming against a cultural tide” in its efforts to reverse the decline in births. While the country’s leaders are likely to stay the same in the near-term, Teo Kay Key, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies Social Lab, said younger Singaporeans will soon want a different style of politics, one that is more open and more participatory.

Article: Twin cathedral bells will ring in unison in Nagasaki for the first time in 80 years, as the Japanese city commemorates the moment the United States decimated it with an atomic bomb eight decades ago. The US dropped an atomic bomb on the southwestern port city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, at 11:02am local time, three days after it dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima. The church in Nagasaki, widely known as Urakami Cathedral, was rebuilt in 1959 after it was almost completely destroyed in the monstrous atomic explosion, the hypocentre of which was just a few hundred metres from the religious building. Spearheading the fundraising campaign for the new church bell was James Nolan – a sociology professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, whose grandfather participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the US’s first nuclear weapons. “It’s not about forgetting the wounds of the past but recognising them and taking action to repair and rebuild, and in doing so, working together for peace,” Yamamura told the AFP news agency.

Article: Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war. They’re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.” Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won’t be easy. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.” Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution. “Putin will say, ‘Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.’ And Trump will say, ‘You’re right about that.’” “Putin is good at those stories,” McFaul continued. That’s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.” Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. Putin may try to “divert President Trump from Trump’s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,” said William Taylor, who was charge d’affaires at the U.S. “Then, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.” No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He’s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he’s an international pariah. “President Trump — just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator — is giving him legitimacy,” McFaul said. At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin’s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there “could be other people also” who interfered in the 2016 election.) This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin’s conduct of the war. “If President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he’s got, there could be a ceasefire.” Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, “will change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.” “That would be a positive diversion,” Coons added. “But it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.” An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.

Article: Earnhardt family disputes aside, the fight in Mooresville echoes similar debates across the country as communities grapple with the potential economic benefits and environmental downsides of giant data centers that are swallowing land and resources to feed America’s insatiable demand for computing power. Crowds of people have packed meetings from Arizona to Alabama to express fears that these projects could overtax the electric grid, pollute the water and air, and generally disrupt their rural peace with hulking structures emitting a high-tech hum. The consulting company McKinsey said in April that it forecasts roughly $7 trillion in global spending on data centers in the next five years, sparked in large part by demand for processing power to meet the needs of tech companies racing to build and develop advanced artificial intelligence systems. In Oldham County, Kentucky, a data center developer pulled out of a project last month and the county’s fiscal court passed a moratorium on data centers after community pushback over environmental concerns. “The volume, speed, and effectiveness of local opposition are reshaping the landscape of political risks for the data center industry,” Data Center Watch said in a statement to NBC News. Sarah Lapidus / USA Today Network Wendy Reigel, an activist in Chesterton, Indiana, routinely gives advice to other communities fighting data centers after she started a successful movement against a $1.3 billion project in her town last year. “In the end, people need hope,” she said, “and then they need information, and then they got to work their rear ends off.” That’s what the organizers in Mooresville have been doing.

Article: ABOVE NORTHERN GAZA — From the sky, a besieged Gaza briefly came into view early Saturday as the military plane opened its back door and a mass of tents could be seen near the Mediterranean coast from a side window. But with mounting international outrage about deaths from starvation in Gaza under Israel’s offensive and crippling aid restrictions, several countries have started dropping food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza from the sky. Burney, who has been treating patients in Gaza for the past week as part of a team with MedGlobal, a Chicago-based nonprofit that arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, added that he had taken care of “multiple patients who’ve been crushed by these sort of unplanned, unannounced aid drops on top of their heads, literally on top of their heads.” Saturday’s flight from an air base just outside the Jordanian capital Amman took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government faced a wave of condemnation from European leaders, Arab nations and a group representing the families of hostages after it announced plans to take control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the plan on Friday as a “dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.” His colleague Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also said in a statement that “the Israeli Government should put all its efforts into saving the lives of Gaza’s civilians by allowing the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.” Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas. It lifted the blockade in May, allowing a basic amount of aid into Gaza, largely distributed under a controversial new distribution system led by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an update Tuesday. Omar Al-Qattaa / AFP - Getty Images Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to “distribute aid to Gaza residents independently.” It said that after “incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted” and that “systematic learning processes” to improve the operational response are underway. Aid groups have also pointed out that the drops can only provide a fraction of what is required for Gaza’s population of around 2 million people as the hunger crisis continues to spiral and much of the enclave plunge into famine conditions. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told journalists Thursday that at least 99 people, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year. Israel has maintained there is no starvation in Gaza and that the situation on the ground is being exaggerated, almost 22 months after it launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. Bashar Taleb / AFP - Getty Images Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed.

Article: Arizona police on Friday released new details about the fatal May drowning of influencer Emilie Kiser’s 3-year-old son, including allegations that her husband placed a $25 bet on an NBA playoff game before the tragic incident. Brady Kiser, the husband of the parenting influencer, was home with the couple’s two sons while his wife was out with friends on May 12 when Trigger drowned in the family’s backyard pool, according to the Chandler Police Department report unsealed on Friday. Police initially recommended that Kiser be charged with one count of child abuse, but the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office later determined that he would not face charges because there was “no reasonable likelihood of conviction.” Kiser’s lawyer previously said that he is “grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident.” According to the report obtained by People magazine, Kiser called the police around 6:41 p.m. In a series of subsequent interviews, Kiser detailed his day to officers after his wife left to meet friends, including feeding his kids dinner and sitting on the couch while watching Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics. It wasn’t that he had been out of sight for long.” Surveillance footage, however, showed that Trigger was unsupervised for at least nine minutes, and had been in the water for at least seven before Kiser found him, the report states. Around that same time, according to Kiser’s phone data detailed in the report, “a $25 wager was placed on Jayson Tatum scoring more than 40 points” on a sports betting app at around 5:14 p.m. The report states that the “wager was a winner, paying $102.50.” The report states that the incident was the result of Trigger being “unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim.” “It is clear Brady’s attention was divided,” the report added. The report’s release came one day after the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County ruled in Emilie Kiser’s favor after she requested to seal certain details about hr son’s death.

Clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms, particularly in the nighttime hours, could drop “very heavy rain” along a corridor stretching from northern Missouri through southern Iowa and into southern Wisconsin, according to the National Weather Service. “Continued daily rounds of heavy rainfall on saturated ground will bring a localized flood risk through the weekend especially across coastal southeast Georgia,” the local branch of the NWS in Jacksonville, Florida, said in its weekend forecast. Though weekend temperatures in Arizona and other parts of the Southwest are expected to be less intense than in recent days, the NWS said high temperatures approaching or exceeding 110 degrees are still possible.

Article: Ventura County officials said Friday that firefighters were making “good progress in suppressing the blaze, aided by favorable weather conditions and the continued use of firefighting aircraft making repeated water and retardant drops to slow the fire’s advance and support crews on the ground.” Still, the fire remains an active threat and continues to spread further east into L.A. County Fire Department said three firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze and were taken to a local hospital “out of an abundance of caution,” but were expected to fully recover. Air quality issues are expected to linger through Sunday morning, according to the agency, which monitors air quality conditions for much of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Air pollution from wildfire smoke is a significant concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair.

Article: After starting 0-2 in five of its last six seasons, the team seemed to agree with criticism that trying to preserve its roster’s preseason health had stunted its readiness for the regular season. “It’s ridiculous.” Yet the Bengals’ shift in preseason philosophy isn’t the norm in a league where the preseason is getting started, but many of the biggest names will likely not. Inside the league, blame or praise for the trend of sharply reducing or outright eliminating starters’ preseason workloads is often attributed to Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay, who began holding out his best players entirely during the preseason in his second season in Los Angeles in 2018, even though the Rams were starting a young quarterback. Los Angeles went on to advance to the Super Bowl, and whether the preseason rest for key players was connected at all to its play during the regular season, it was enough in a copycat league — where new ideas do not stay proprietary for long — for others to adopt the same approach. During the 2024 preseason, 14 teams didn’t play their presumed starter for a single snap during the first two weeks of the preseason — up from just one team in 2014, according to a comparison done last year. “Sometimes what you do in practice and then play in a game is a whole different aspect.” McVay and the Rams might not have put their top players on ice during preseason games if not for the rise of another trend happening at the same time, as franchises increasingly began hosting “joint practices.” Their appeal stemmed from the opportunity for quality repetitions but in a more controlled scrimmage than a game. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams said he believed preseason “reps are always paramount for anybody like myself: a young rookie, second-year guy, [or] third-year guy.” Yet this year, as a second-year guy playing under a new head coach in Chicago, the quarterback will not play in the Bears’ preseason opener. This month, 30 of the 32 teams will play three preseason games — only the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions, who also played in the July 31 Hall of Fame exhibition, will play more — and many have signaled that they will again play starters and stars sparingly, if at all. He reportedly offered to play, but was among a group of 15 starters who will sit out at least the first preseason game because “they need less runway to take off, to be quite honest with you,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. A player as good as Burrow would seemingly need little proverbial runway, either, but he has called the Bengals’ change of philosophy “the right decision.” But not everyone is altering their approach to the preseason.

Article: As she juggled temp jobs, financial anxiety and a society that resisted making room for her, Butler wrote genre-defining literature that has been adapted for TV and film in recent years, and has continued to go viral nearly two decades after her death in 2006 at 58. “Positive Obsession,” named for a 1989 essay by Butler, pulls from journals, interviews and personal letters in Butler’s public archives to illuminate the forces that shaped her, revealing an ambitious and meticulous writer. Chrissandra Jallah For most of her career, Butler woke up before dawn to write for hours ahead of what she once called “lots of horrible little jobs.” As she toiled in factories and warehouses, washing dishes, inspecting potato chips and making telemarketing calls, Butler conjured characters from her everyday encounters. Morris told NBC that in sharing Butler’s story now, 19 years after her death, she hopes to inspire artists who don’t think they can afford to create to find the time. “In this economic system that we’re currently in, we are so crunched down trying to buy eggs or pay the rent,” Morris said “sometimes we don’t even feel like we can access art for art’s sake. Her novel “Kindred” was reimagined into a TV series in 2022, and authors John Jennings and Damian Duffy won a Hugo Award in 2021 for their graphic novel reimagining of her book “Parable of the Sower.” “Positive Obsession: The Life and Times of Octavia E. In “Parable of the Talents,” published in 1998 and set in the 2020s, Butler introduces a conservative presidential candidate who urges voters to join him in a project to “make America great again.” The words on the page reverberated through Morris’ classroom as she taught the book during Trump’s first presidency. Absolutely.” Morris uses the 1987 short story “The Evening and the Morning and the Night” — about a community grappling with a fictional genetic disorder — to talk to students about the marginalization of people with disabilities. Though often shelved as science fiction, Morris says Butler’s work transcends the label, and she instead classifies it as “speculative fiction.” Morris’ immersive portrait can at times feel like reading Butler’s journal or listening to the innermost thoughts of a quiet and sometimes lonely person. “I hope that in this world that is often devoid of beauty,” Morris said, “that other folks can see her example and find the beauty in their own kind of practice.”

Article: When Sheffield Wednesday FC kicks off the new season on Sunday — away at Leicester City in the Championship, the second tier of British soccer — more than 3,000 traveling fans will not take their seats to cheer on their beloved team, known as the Owls. Instead, they will hold a five-minute protest outside Leicester’s King Power Stadium against one man: Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, Wednesday’s owner and the focal point of a growing crisis that may threaten its very existence. The team’s financial problems are mounting, and unsuccessful attempts to sell it have dominated local sports media and online forums for months — and the crisis has much wider implications for the health of English soccer away from the glitzy riches of Liverpool and Manchester City. The problem is so acute that the British government has passed a new law that will launch a football regulator to police the buying and selling of teams and make sure owners are “fit and proper.” For Wednesday, founded in 1867, that could be too little, too late. Some teams have bad offseasons, but this summer has seen Wednesday set new levels of chaos: Players and staff have not been paid on time in four of the last five months. At least 15 players have left on free transfers or for a fraction of their market value this summer, leaving barely enough players to fill a match day squad of 11 starters and up to nine substitutes. “It’s becoming a soap opera,” said Dan Fudge, who co-hosts the popular podcast “The Wednesday Week.” “Usually, as podcasters, we’re scratching for content to talk about during the summer,” Fudge said, “but we seem to have had a new timeline of terror every single week to talk about.” The list of mishaps goes on. The famous old Hillsborough Stadium is literally falling apart — Sheffield City Council refused to grant a safety license for the vast 9,000-seat North Stand due to concerns of uncovering wiring and cracks in the terrace. Kieran Maguire, a leading British football finance expert and commentator, puts the real value at 40 million pounds ($53 million), but Chansiri said in June that he rejected an offer at this price from a U.S.-based consortium. Maguire said it was unlikely Wednesday would go bust entirely, but he said that in any case the team would almost certainly be relegated to the league below and face a very tough season. This summer alone, the 20 Premier League teams have spent around 1.8 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on transfer fees, with reigning champions Liverpool splashing out 252 million pounds ($335 million). Between them, the Premier League clubs made more than 6 billion pounds ($8 billion) in revenue in the 2024-25 season, an increase of 36% from the previous year, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. The league, criticized by some fans for not acting sooner, warned the Thai magnate that the club needed to “meet its obligations or make good on his commitment to sell to a well-funded party, for fair market value.” Could things even get worse? This week, Morecambe FC, a team in the northwest seaside town of the same name, was suspended from the National League, the fifth tier of English football’s sprawling pyramid-shaped league system, with the elite clubs at the top and smaller, more parochial clubs toward the bottom. “Then, over recent years, you look at teams like Bury and what’s recently happened to Morecambe, and they’ve not had that white knight step in, and all of a sudden we’re thinking, ‘Oh hang on a minute, we could be the big scalp.’” Like many fans, Fudge has no doubt who is to blame. “Pure ineptitude is how we’ve got here, regardless of the warning signs around Chansiri since about 2018.” Fans warmly remember the 1990s, when players such as Chris Waddle, David Hirst and Des Walker — all England internationals — lined up alongside some of the then-hottest talent in Europe, helping the club reach seventh place in the Premier League during the 1996-97 season. David Blunkett, a senior minister during Tony Blair’s government in the 1990s and 2000s and now a member of the House of Lords, is a lifelong Wednesday fan and attended an online meeting with the football league on Thursday. “Parliamentarians, including those representing the city, the Supporters’ Trust and other fans will clearly continue to pressurize for an immediate resolution of the crisis at Hillsborough,” he told NBC News. Hailing from the north side of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, a city famous for its steel, Wednesday became an early member of the Football Association (the term “soccer” is an abbreviation of “association”), as the football craze swept through working-class communities across the North and the Midlands. The team got its unique name from cricket: In the mid-19th century, there were multiple teams in Sheffield playing this game, and the one that played on Wednesdays started a football team. “There’s a lot of people that are very much in the camp of ‘Let’s protest, let’s get this message out as much as we can,’ which I completely agree with, but it’s not everybody’s bag, because a lot of people use the football to spend time with their family and their friends,” Fudge said.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. “I have so many people who come to me and say to me, ‘I love your music, I want to give, but I’m sorry, I don’t carry cash,’” said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. Evie Steele for NBC News There’s no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. “I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, ‘Thank you,’ because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away,” Deitz said. “But then people that didn’t pay see those people walk away, and they go, ‘Well, I guess it’s acceptable to walk away.’” For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. “People would stop and talk to us.” Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. “You might think that it’s worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you’re getting cash out of your wallet and you’re fumbling around for change.” But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think “tipping culture is out of control.” That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.

Article: “It’s been pretty hard.” The brother, who spoke exclusively to NBC News, is not being named out of concern for his family members’ safety after they were sent to an area of Mexico known for kidnappings of U.S. “I don’t know why it’s taking so long.” USCIS did not respond to a request for comment, but according to its website, applicants may demonstrate urgency by establishing a reason to be in the U.S. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, previously told NBC News that reports of the family’s situation are “inaccurate” and declined to speak on the specifics of the case, citing privacy reasons. The spokesperson said in a statement that when “someone is given expedited removal orders and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences.” A church community calls for 'compassion' — and lends a hand Marco Polo Coronado Jr., the lead pastor at the church the boy’s family began attending last year following his sister’s diagnosis, said allowing the family to come back so that their 11-year-old can receive the treatment she needs with the support of her entire family “seems like a no-brainer” to him. “When you find Jesus, when you have a relationship with Christ, it’s hard to avoid.” Church members who are hoping for the family's return have been helping the teen maintain the house after his parents were deported. Texas Civil Rights Project “It is a wonderful family, and I think they go out of their way to try to make ends meet for their family and do all the right things for them and bring them up the right way,” Coronado said, adding that their “remarkable children” excel in music and the arts.

Article: To help pet parents (myself included) learn how to keep dogs cool in the heat, I talked to veterinarians about the best products to do so and safety tips to keep in mind. The best cooling products for dogs The type of cooling product you may want to use for your dog depends on the situation — for example, booties or paw balm is useful when walking on hot pavement, while water bottles keep pups hydrated. Best water sprayer Instead of putting your dog in a pool to get their paws wet, you can use a hose or put them in the bathtub or shower, so long as the water isn’t hot, says Kaplan. Best cooling dog bed Coolaroo The Original Elevated Dog Bed $ 32.46 Amazon What to know What we like Multiple sizes available Easy to clean Breathable fabric Something to note Assembly required Outdoor dog beds prevent pups from lying on hot surfaces indoors and outdoors. Best dog cooling mat Cooling mats give dogs a cold surface to rest on indoors or outdoors, says Sara Bonomo, a certified dog trainer and the owner of All 4 Paws. The best hydrating products for dogs Best water bowl Ensuring your dog has access to fresh water at all times is important regardless of the weather, but it becomes even more crucial when it’s hot out — dogs tend to drink more during high temperatures to stay hydrated, so be sure to refill their bowl often, says Kaplan. Petlibro’s water fountain has a 2.1-gallon capacity, and between Mabel and my two cats drinking out of it, I refill it every few days by pouring water directly into the serving tray. PupFlask’s dishwasher-safe dog water bottle comes in two sizes (27 and 40 ounces) and it’s composed of two parts: a stainless steel bottle that stores water and a silicone lid that folds into a drinking bowl. Best cooling enrichment toy In addition to drinking water, licking ice cubes and other frozen treats can keep dogs hydrated, plus it gives them an engaging indoor activity to do if it’s too hot for outdoor play or walks. The spherical-shaped rubber toy rolls around while dogs use it so they have to work for their frozen treat, keeping them entertained for 15 to 30 minutes, in my experience. The best sun protection products for dogs Best dog booties Ruffwear Grip Trex Dog Boots $ 44.95 Amazon What to know What we like Breathable fabric Thick, grippy outsole Multiple sizes available Something to note Uncomfortable for some dogs Booties protect dogs’ paws from hot pavement, and Ruffwear sells one of Bonomo’s favorite pairs. Musher’s Secret Dog Paw Wax is made with natural waxes and oils like vitamin E and beeswax, ingredients that create an invisible protective barrier on paw pads and keep them soft so they don’t dry out, according to the brand. Sunscreen can help protect your pup from UV rays, so long as you use an option that’s specifically made for dogs — some ingredients in sunscreen for humans are toxic to dogs if ingested, like zinc oxide, which is often in mineral sunscreen, according to the American Kennel Club. Best UPF clothing DogZStuff Dog Cooling Vest with UV Protection $ 24.95 Amazon What to know What we like Dog sunscreen alternative Doubles as a cooling towel Multiple sizes available Something to note Nothing to note at this time UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) measures a product’s ability to block sunlight, and UPF clothing, hats and goggles can act as an alternative to dog sunscreen if you find it challenging to apply, experts say. How to keep dogs cool: The top do’s and don’ts, according to vets Regardless of whether you live in a warm climate year-round or temperatures are rising in your area due to seasonality, your goal as a dog owner is to prevent your pet from overheating in the first place instead of working to cool them down afterward, says Kaplan. In extreme temperatures, like those you may experience during a heat wave, only take your dog outside for about five to 10 minutes, or just enough time to relieve themselves, says Satchu. Once you factor in humidity, 70-degree temperatures, which may be relatively comfortable for us, can feel much warmer for dogs since their average body temperatures are naturally a few degrees higher than humans, experts told me. Thus, 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the absolute maximum indoor temperature dogs should be exposed to if necessary — it should not be their norm, and it’s only safe if they have access to plenty of fresh water, can lay on cool surfaces like tile floors and are not exposed to direct sunlight, says Kratt. That’s why it’s important to check on your dog when they spend time outside and keep an eye out for telltale signs they’re overheating, including: Anxiousness or relentlessness Excessive panting and drooling Rapid breathing Vomiting or diarrhea Abnormal gum and tongue color Unsteadiness, disorientation and collapse If you’re concerned that your dog is severely overheating or experiencing heatstroke, take them inside immediately and bring them to a veterinarian, says Kratt.

How to shop for college dorm essentials Before you start dorm shopping, here are a few things to consider: Student discounts: While shopping, remember that many retailers offer student discounts and student memberships. For example, after proving that you’re enrolled at a college through your school email address or student ID, you can create an Amazon Prime Student account, which offers benefits like fast shipping and exclusive prices on select products. Not all bedding retailers carry products in twin XL sizes, so you should always check which brands carry fitted sheets, flat sheets and other bedding to fit your dorm bed. After living in dorms for years, both Yi and Malin have gained knowledge of which products worked and didn’t, as well as the products they could have used but didn’t have at the time.

The best cushioned running shoes Best overall The New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 may have a mouthful of a name, but they are excellent running shoes available in a variety of colors. The best supportive running shoes Best for wide feet and bunions These cushioned, chunky shoes have a spacious and wide toe box — Cunha recommends them for people with wide feet or bunions. These shoes strike a great balance between cushion and responsiveness — I feel fast, but not so connected to the pavement that every nook and cranny feels like a surprise.

Article: As Southern California continued to experience a heat wave, officials on Saturday lifted the final evacuation orders in areas affected by the Canyon fire, which has burned more than 5,000 acres in northern Los Angeles and Ventura counties. With the fire about 28% contained, overnight fire activity was “minimal” and crews worked to further secure the perimeter, protect structures and look for hot spots, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Advertisement Battalion Chief James Agee of the Kern County Fire Department was seriously injured Friday when the pickup truck he was driving rolled over in the Romero Canyon area in Castaic, where he was involved in a team effort to monitor Canyon fire along the ridge line, a fire official said. Andrew Freeborn, a public information officer for the Kern County Fire Department, did not confirm Agee’s assignment, but said he was in a “lead position for a task force, which was made up of five fire engines and approximately 17 people.” Agee was driving by himself when the truck rolled over into steep terrain. “James is a strong man with a big heart, and we know he’s facing this challenge with the same strength and character he’s shown throughout his career,” said Kern County Fire Chief Aaron Duncan in a statement. “We are grateful for the swift actions of our crews and partner agencies, and for the kindness being shown to his family.” Advertisement Agee is in stable condition but still being treated for his serious injuries, the public information officer said Saturday. “But then you look at the response and how quickly care is then provided because our firefighters are all very well trained, and sometimes our training is applied to ourselves.” The region’s hot spell hampered efforts to quell the fire, triggering poor air conditions , according to the National Weather Service. Advertisement Inland valley areas were expected to see triple-digit temperatures throughout the weekend, with forecast highs of 106 in Lancaster and 103 in Northridge, according to the National Weather Service . “There is a moderate risk for heat related illnesses for vulnerable populations, and any fire starts in interior areas could grow rapidly, as we saw with the Canyon Fire on Thursday,” the National Weather Service said on X.

Article: Though it was not yet noon, the temperature was already inching toward triple digits, and it felt even hotter for the scores of farmworkers hunched in the rows of watermelon plants in this field tucked by a bend in the Sacramento River north of California’s capital. Their boss, Jose Chavez, said he tries to be vigilant about the danger of heat illness, making sure there is plenty of drinking water in the fields and that workers can take breaks in the shade and knock off early on blistering days. “When you start taking people to the hospital, it’s not fun.” That lesson, however, has not stuck with many employers, and 20 years after California enacted a landmark heat safety law, farmworkers across the state are still getting sick and sometimes dying from preventable heat illness. Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), a former farmworker who carried legislation last year that would have made it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation if they were stricken by heat illness on the job. People are dying.” Last month, the California state auditor blasted the California Department of Occupational Health and Safety , finding, among other problems, that the agency’s inspectors failed to take proper action when workers suffered heat illness on the job. Advertisement The enforcement lapses come at a time when farmworkers — many of whom lack legal status and fear deportation — are already hesitant to voice complaints about working conditions, fearful that employers could retaliate by reporting them to immigration authorities. This week, as the hottest temperatures of the summer descend just as harvest season hits its peak — and at a time when the Trump administration has stepped up immigration raids across California — some say farm laborers face more risks that ever. Cruz was the fourth farmworker to die in that brutal summer 20 years ago, in which heat deaths also claimed a man picking bell peppers in Arvin, a melon picker in Fresno County and a grape picker in Kern County. Advertisement The rules, which were the first of their kind in the country, require bosses to provide outdoor workers with fresh water, access to shade when the temperatures climb, and breaks to cool off whenever workers request them. In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers union sued Cal/OSHA, saying the statute was too weak and the agency’s enforcement was “woefully inadequate.” The suit said 11 farmworkers had died since the law went into effect. Three years later, the nonprofit law firm Public Counsel filed another suit, alleging that the state’s failure to enforce the problems had persisted, and that farmworkers were continuing to die. Of more than 1,200 workers surveyed, 43% reported that their employers had not provided a heat illness prevention plan and 15% said they had not received heat illness prevention training. It’s excuse after excuse, year after year.” This year, Assemblywoman Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced another proposed law, similar to the one Newson vetoed last year, making it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation.

Once a week, Nicholls helps organize a rally that includes a march through the parking lot and into the store, where the protesters present a letter asking Home Depot management to “say no to ICE in their parking lot and in their store.” Nicholls is an LAUSD teacher-librarian, and when she asks for support each week, working and retired teachers answer the call. “I’m yelling my lungs out,” said retired teacher Mary Rose O’Leary, who joined in the chants of “ICE out of Home Depot” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” Sharon Nicholls gets a hug of support from another protester outside the Home Depot in Pasadena. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) “Immigrants are what make this city what it is … and the path to legal immigration is closed to everybody who doesn’t have what, $5 million or something?” O’Leary said, adding that she was motivated by “the Christian ideal of welcoming the stranger.” Advertisement Retired teacher Dan Murphy speaks Spanish and regularly checks in with day laborers. “One guy said to me, ‘We’re just here to work.’ Some of the guys were like, ‘We’re not criminals … we’re just here … to make money and get by,’” Murphy said. And it bothers me what might happen in this country if people don’t stand firm … I just said, ‘I gotta do something.’ I’m doing this now so I don’t hate myself later.” Nicholls told me she was an activist many years ago, and then turned her focus to work and raising a family. “You’d see them in orange shirts all over the city, cleaning up.” The East Pasadena Home Depot is “an important store,” because it’s a supply center for the rebuilding of Altadena, “and we’re going out there to show our love and solidarity for our neighbors,” Nicholls said. To strike the fear of deportation in the hearts of workers, she said, is “inhumane, and to me, it’s morally wrong.” Nicholls had a quick response when I asked what she thinks of those who say illegal is illegal, so what’s left to discuss? When the raids began, Nicholls said, she told her husband, “I have the summer off, sweetie, but I want to help, and I’m going to call my friends.” On Wednesday, after Nicholls welcomed demonstrators, Alvarado showed up for a pep talk. “Some people may say that we are going into fascism, into authoritarianism, and I would say that we are already there.” He offered details of a raid that morning at a Home Depot in Westlake and said the question is not whether the Pasadena store will be raided, but when.

Article: The plan would almost double the company’s current timetable of 50 rockets a year, despite clashing with the California Coastal Commission over concerns about the impact that the blasts could have on coastal wildlife, and on nearby residents who have reported startling sonic booms with the already steep rise in launches. But the Air Force and SpaceX have quickly moved to dramatically increase the number of rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force in Santa Barbara County, asking the commission to agree to 36, then to 50, and now 95 rocket blasts a year. The fast uptick in rocket launches off the California coast has put the space exploration company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in direct conflict with the California Coastal Commission, whose members have raised concerns about the impact of the launches, the lack of monitoring and whether the privately owned company is circumventing the permit process because it is a federal contractor, despite most of the rocket launches involving no equipment or missions for U.S. During the October meeting, commissioners cited concerns that Musk had inserted himself into the presidential race, spread conspiracy theories on social media and faced serious allegations that employees at his companies have been mistreated. Commissioners have also pointed to reports that Musk’s company, Starlink, had refused to allow Ukraine to use satellite internet service to help carry out an attack against Russia in 2022, and questioned whether Musk’s decisions did not directly conflict with those of a U.S. Advertisement Cooperation between the state commission and the Department of Air Force also seems to have flailed after the October meeting, with little agreement or communication between the two agencies. During the October meeting when the commission rejected the plan for 50 launches, officials from the base said they had hoped to work with the commission to address seven conditions that had been requested from the U.S. Advertisement The plan for more launches, submitted by the Air Force to the commission, would also double the number of landing events at the military base, which have also been reported to generate their own sonic boom blast. According to the staff report, the base expects 24 SpaceX rocket landing events a year at Vandenberg, including 12 first-stage booster landings and five Falcon Heavy missions that would have two boosters landing simultaneously at the base. On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission is scheduled to consider SpaceX’s plan to fire 95 rockets a year, but military officials are expected to move forward with the plan despite the panel’s decision. Military officials have argued that the SpaceX launches should be considered federal activity because all of the launches — even those done for the private benefit of Musk’s company, Starlink — also benefit U.S. A previous staff report from the commission stated that 87% of SpaceX launches from Vandenberg weren’t carrying equipment or conducting missions for government agencies, but were carrying equipment for Starlink. launch providers continue to innovate, offering agile, service-based solutions that operate at the ‘speed of need.’ ” Staff for the coastal commission are expected to again raise concerns about the doubling of rocket launches from the base, arguing that military officials and SpaceX are not providing enough information about the impacts on wildlife, are failing to do enough monitoring to measure the impacts and reach of sonic booms, and that SpaceX should seek permits for its launches because it is conducting them for private benefit, not for the federal government. “Rather, the existing available information indicates that the proposed launch cadence’s primary purpose is to further expand and support SpaceX’s commercial satellite internet and telecommunications network, Starlink.” Despite the pending lawsuit, staff for the coastal commission continue to argue in its report that launches by SpaceX should be regulated as a private company.

A number of unmarked white vans started circling the parking lot and immigration agents began “grabbing people first and then asking people for ID” said Ortiz, adding that her organization has confirmed 10 people were taken. “It is very clear they are targeting day laborers and they are targeting the organization.” Advertisement Ortiz said immigration agents conducted another raid near a Home Depot in Cypress Park on Saturday. district judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. The Trump administration has since appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the ruling “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Following the temporary restraining order, Southern California saw a significant drop in the number of undocumented immigrants arrested. Then on Wednesday, Customs and Border Protection agents burst out of a Penske rental truck and detained day laborers at a Westlake Home Depot in a raid dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse.” Immigration protests grew heated at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly around 9 p.m. “Our communities deserve dignity and to not be harassed.” At a news conference Friday, Feldstein Soto said that video from the Westlake raid appeared to show the Trump administration violating the court’s temporary restraining order but noted that the matter was still under investigation. Advertisement “We are very cognizant of the fact that that Penske truck seemed to be engaged in a lot of the exact behavior that the language of the TRO specifically prohibits,” she said. A Penske spokesman previously told The Times that the company was not aware its trucks would be used in the operation and had not authorized the federal government to do so. “The Border Patrol, CBP and our allied law enforcement partners, when we conduct law enforcement operations, we always abide by the law — whether it’s a temporary restraining order ... “We’re going after it, and that’s exactly what we did.” Advertisement He said that of the 16 people apprehended during Operation Trojan Horse, at least six had “significant immigration and criminal histories.” He said this reflects the trend seen in larger immigration operations, where 30% to 40% of people arrested typically have significant immigration and criminal histories.

President Trump is “trying to silence academic freedom” by “attacking one of the most important public institutions in the United States of America,” Newsom said, adding that he would “stand tall and push back against that, and I believe every member of California Legislature feels the same way.” Advertisement California UCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant negotiations, Newsom says Making his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do ‘the right thing.’ The federal government on Friday said UC should pay the billion-dollar fine in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In addition, the Trump administration demanded sweeping campus changes encompassing protests, admissions, gender identity in sports and housing, the abolition of scholarships for racial or ethnic groups, and submission to an outside monitor over the agreement, according to four UC senior officials who have reviewed the proposal. Advertisement The governor appeared to be referring to controversial and costly deals the Trump administration secured from Columbia and Brown universities over charges similar to those facing UCLA, deals Newsom criticized a day earlier in public remarks. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump’s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” Milliken said. economy, and protect our national security.” Advertisement UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times the university was still willing to negotiate with the Trump administration but not on “unacceptable” terms. “Demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA, coupled with conditions that contradict the university’s values, is unacceptable,” Reilly said, describing it as a “financial burden” that would be “catastrophic for our students, research, our patients and the people of California. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. So how does that make sense?” Advertisement But another senior UC official said the figure was understandable if it resolved all federal investigations across the system, even if UC may not ultimately agree to it. UC and individual campuses are under multiple federal investigations into alleged use of race in admissions, employment discrimination against Jews, civil rights complaints from Jewish students and improper reporting of foreign donations. The encampment, which unsuccessfully demanded the university divest from weapons companies tied to Israel’s war in Gaza, was targeted in a violent overnight attack last spring and was later the subject of federal lawsuit by pro-Israel Jewish students. The Trump administration’s Friday offer follows a similar playbook to agreements it reached with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding and resolve allegations of civil rights violations against Jewish and Israeli students.

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required. “This is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it’s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the 5th Amendment guarantees.” Debrorah Fleischaker, the former chief of staff at U.S. “My guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.” Eduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood, said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed. The way they try to accomplish mass deportation is by pushing the boundaries of civil liberties in the same way that they’ve done for people like Job.” Casas said he interviewed other citizens present during raids and a pattern emerged.

Advertisement Kounalakis said in a statement that as treasurer, she can “make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future.” The state treasurer manages California’s assets and serves on powerful boards that oversee the state employee pension systems and award financing for affordable housing and infrastructure projects. That role, Kounalakis said, would allow her to focus on “fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity and strategic investment in our state’s priorities — from affordable housing and clean energy to infrastructure and education.” “This work is critical and I am prepared for the challenge,” Kounalakis said. Her exit from the governor’s race creates an opening for other candidates to build relationships and secure contributions from those donors, some of whom were waiting to give until Harris made a decision.

Article: Firefighters are continuing to make progress battling a wildfire burning in the hills near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line, allowing thousands of evacuated residents to return to their homes Friday evening as public health officials warned of potentially unhealthy air in the area through the weekend. Friday, crews had reached 28% containment on the 5,370-acre Canyon fire burning near Castaic, which broke out amid a heat wave Thursday and has destroyed at least two buildings and injured three firefighters, according to the L.A. Evacuation orders affecting around 2,700 residents have been downgraded to warnings, while evacuation warnings affecting around 14,000 residents have been lifted, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “I think residents in the area can be thankful for the firefighters that came here to help serve them.” Advertisement At 6:20 p.m., a single vehicle rolled over at the scene of the fire and one person was taken to a hospital for treatment, Dowd said. According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, smoke from the Canyon fire is causing unhealthy air quality in Los Angeles County, primarily in the 5 Freeway corridor near Castaic Lake. Taking advantage of cooler temperatures Thursday night into Friday morning, crews were able to make inroads against the fast-moving blaze that grew to several thousand acres in a matter of hours, Dowd said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) Dowd said he expects containment to grow over Friday night as firefighters double down on the work that’s been done so far — “so that’s patrolling, mopping up, reinforcing containment lines, addressing hot spots and flareups as they occur, and continuing to provide structure defense and structure protection to those properties that may be at risk.” Residents in the Val Verde area said flames were visible from the neighborhood’s western edge Thursday, but the threat appeared to have calmed a bit by Friday morning, though the air remained thick with soot and ash. This is a pretty big threat to the community.” The Canyon fire quickly became one of the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. Temperatures were forecast to peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, and that heat plus the winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend, said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,” the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast. (Eric Thayer / Getty Images) Advertisement The American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the fire’s proximity to the Pitchess Detention Center, where about 5,000 inmates are housed in four jails. “It’s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn’t reach them.” The L.A. “Similar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter-in-place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,” agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement. The Fire Management Assistance Grant can provide federal funding for up to 75% of eligible firefighting costs, including expenses for field camps, equipment use, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities, according to FEMA.

It borders on the impossible to verify anything venerable as “the first,” but L.A.’s first restaurant was likely in the Bella Union Hotel, opened in downtown in 1850 in an even older building. [A Bella Union newspaper ad 20 years later vaguely promised that its bill of fare “shall be inferior to none in the State.”] Voices Commentary: A tale of two parks: One was a ‘poor boy’s Disneyland,’ the other had a Cobra Woman who was really a man The Pike in Long Beach and the Pacific Ocean Park in Santa Monica had distinct personality: One was a bit naughty and coarse and the other was wholesome and futuristic. Italian restaurant-goers were advised to ditch steak and potatoes to try “authentic” Italian food like artichokes, and the “peculiarly seasoned tomato sauce.” Or they could join movie stars and sports heroes for original chili burgers at “Ptomaine Tommy’s” in Lincoln Heights, which started out in 1913 as a street lunch wagon. Clifton’s, founded in the Depression year of 1931, once ran a chain of cafeterias arguably less notable for the food — beef dishes, fried chicken, Jell-o salads — than for the elaborate décor of religious dioramas, exotic South Seas vistas, and redwood faux forests. In the 18 decades since the Bella Union’s opened a kitchen, Angelenos never lost their beefsteak appetites, and 20th century steakhouses arose as haute cuisine, with steak places arrayed along La Cienega’s “Restaurant Row.” In Studio City, Glendale, Palm Springs and Bakersfield, waiters at the Saddle and Sirloin restaurants handed diners a page of beef choices, and a few chicken and fish alternatives, printed on a die-cut menu embossed to look like a fancy gun holster. Woody Allen made fun of the place and its vibe in “Annie Hall.” His character met Diane Keaton there and snottily ordered “alfalfa sprouts and mashed yeast.” The food reform movement was a hit with Angelenos. “From here you go into the world of alfalfa sprouts.” Advertisement Our big, warm climate and our wide-open spaces made possible something that earned its own genre: mimetic architecture, whimsical buildings that look like something else, often the thing that they sell.

Article: A law firm for the city of Los Angeles racked up $1.8 million in legal bills over two weeks while fighting a nonprofit’s attempt to take control of homelessness away from Mayor Karen Bass. A high-profile law firm representing the city of Los Angeles in a sweeping homelessness case submitted an $1.8-million invoice for two weeks of work in May, according to records reviewed by The Times. With at least 15 of Gibson Dunn’s lawyers billing at nearly $1,300 per hour, the price tag so far equates to just under $140,000 per day over a 13-day period. Los Angeles officials retained the law firm in May, roughly a week before a seven-day evidentiary hearing to determine whether control over the city’s homelessness programs should be taken away from Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council and turned over to a third-party receiver. “Instead, they are paying a law firm to fight tooth and nail against obligations that are clear in the settlement agreement — and that a judge has affirmed they are in violation of.” Advertisement The invoice, which The Times obtained from the city attorney’s office, lists a billing period from May 19 to May 31, covering a week of preparations for the high-stakes federal hearing, as well as four of the seven trial days — each of which typically lasted eight or more hours. city’s homelessness programs over to a receiver After hearing seven days of testimony, a federal judge is deliberating on a request from a group of business owners, property owners and residents to place the city of Los Angeles’ billion-dollar homelessness programs under a receivership. Hydee Feldstein Soto, said in a statement that Gibson Dunn “did an outstanding job of stepping into a crucial matter that had been in litigation for nearly 5 years before they were hired,” compressing “what would normally be years worth of work into a very short time period.” “We are grateful for their service and are in the process of reviewing the expenditures ... During the seven-day hearing, Gibson Dunn took a highly aggressive posture, voicing numerous objections to questions from attorneys representing the Alliance, as well as two organizations that intervened in the case. Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who serves on the council’s homelessness committee, said the city attorney’s office did not advise him that Gibson Dunn’s legal costs had reached $1.8 million in such a short period. McOsker, who serves on the budget committee and spent several years running the city attorney’s office, also did not receive notification of the Gibson Dunn $1.8-million invoice from the city’s legal team, according to Sophie Gilchrist, his spokesperson. Advertisement “That’s why the Councilmember is requesting that this matter be brought to City Council immediately, so the City Attorney can provide a full accounting and discuss all invoices related to the case,” she said. Gibson Dunn has filed a notice of the city’s intent to appeal at least portions of Carter’s ruling, which ordered a third-party monitor to review and verify the data being produced by the city on its housing and encampment goals. In a statement to The Times earlier this week, Evangelis, the Gibson Dunn lawyer, cited the judge’s “suggestion that the Alliance may recover attorneys’ fees” as one reason for the appeal. “The City believes that its resources should be spent providing services to those in need, not redirected to the Alliance’s lawyers — particularly when the district court has rejected most of their arguments,” she said.

Article: Jason Hong, 75, has had his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk stolen, and returned, multiple times in the last couple of months, but he and police have no idea who has been taking the colorful plane. While Jason Hong was celebrating his 75th birthday, he suddenly found himself thinking about his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk, a white and red single-engine beauty with colorful stripes that he calls his “old treasure.” He doesn’t fly it much anymore, but given the occasion he resolved to visit his plane as soon as he could to “say hi,” like a lifelong friend you see around holidays and special occasions. As Hong would come to find out, the colorful aircraft had been flown across Southern California by an unknown pilot, unnoticed, in a series of joyrides — or joy flights — at least twice before and then simply returned to the airport. After finding his plane a second time, Hong said he’s tried to put details of the thefts together, but the more he learns the more he grows confused about the circumstances. Hong looked up his plane on Flight Aware, a site that tracks flights and aircraft, and found that on his 75th birthday, someone took off with his plane from La Verne airport at 9:54 p.m., for a 51-minute flight that at one point neared Palm Springs. A few hours later, on July 26, the colorfully striped plane was in the air once again, this time for a brief 22-minute flight from Riverside County toward La Verne that started at about 1:30 a.m. The replacement of the battery, Hong said, also suggests its someone familiar with not just flying, but the mechanics of the plane as they seemed to have the tools and know-how about the type of battery needed, and how to install it. The 75-year-old Yorba Linda resident said he’s spoken to regular pilots and employees at the San Gabriel Valley Airport in El Monte, who said that they saw the plane flying in and out of the airport multiple times in July. “This is really a rare situation.” Advertisement One regular at the airport, Hong said, told him he saw a woman, about 5 feet, 3 inches tall, and in her 40s or 50s, flying and sitting in the plane on multiple occasions. The man told Hong he had a conversation with her at one point, and distinctly remembered her because she was often seen sitting in the cockpit during the day, making people at the airport wonder why she wouldn’t just relax in the air-conditioned airport lounge.

Article: Myra Villarreal wipes tears as her son Adrian Martinez, 20, describes how he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. Advertisement Civil rights activists, city leaders, immigrants and their advocates were hopeful that the indiscriminate sweeps targeting Latinos were over in July after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that Border Patrol agents’ profiling tactics violated the 4th Amendment. Mayor Karen Bass said it appears as if the Wednesday raid at a Home Depot in Westlake — dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” — violated the order, but city attorneys are still trying to determine the facts. Advertisement Now other parts of the country are watching the events in California, expecting federal agents to target their immigrant communities, particularly in states with no judicial orders blocking them. “We’re just waiting for the shoe to drop.” The Times reviewed dozens of witness and surveillance videos, pored through criminal complaints and interviewed lawyers, advocates, bystanders and experts to understand how on-the-ground operations have unfolded this summer and where the points of contention are. Border Patrol agents were driving down West Olympic Boulevard in Montebello — a largely Latino community — when surveillance footage captured their white SUV make a U-turn and pull into the driveway of a tow yard at 4:32 p.m on June 12. As Homeland Security Investigations special agent Nicholas DeSimone later wrote in a federal criminal complaint, the operation was not preplanned but rather part of a “roving patrol”— a controversial tactic that lawsuits link to racial profiling and was widely used in the Los Angeles area after the raids started in June. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong that plaintiffs had documented an “overwhelming record” showing the government “has a policy and practice of conducting so called roving patrols throughout this district to stop individuals without ever making a particularized, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion that the person is in the United States in violation of U.S. Past lawsuits show that Border Patrol agents determined on the fly who to stop, based on the slightest behaviors, from people slowing abruptly, speeding up, avoiding eye contact or not sitting upright. On June 17, Vivaldo Montes Herrera was pushing a trash can across the parking lot of the plaza he’s cleaned for years when he spotted a marked Border Patrol truck, out on a roving patrol, coming straight toward him. As Border Patrol captioned an Instagram video last month: “When they run, we chase.” Across the country, people now wrestle with the question of what do when confronted by immigration agents: Do I run? In her ruling, Judge Frimpong did not order the agents to stop the practice but expressed misgivings about it, noting that the government hadn’t explained “why fleeing upon seeing unidentified masked men with guns exiting from tinted cars without license plates raises suspicion.” Adrian Martinez, 20, with his mom Myra Villarreal, left, describes how his neck was bruised and his leg was injured after he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) In El Monte, when Montes Herrera was being detained, Adrian Martinez, a worker at a Walmart in the plaza, tried to intervene and was arrested alongside him. Martinez said he heard agents laughing at Montes Herrera and calling him “dumb for running.” Advertisement “We wouldn’t have chased him if he wouldn’t have ran,” Martinez recalled the agents saying. Immigration agents said arrests in June and July often stemmed from “consensual encounters.” Advertisement “The individuals were free to walk away and terminate the encounter, decline to answer questions and refuse to provide requested identification documents,” Kyle Harvick, who heads patrol for the El Centro Sector, said in a court declaration defending the practice used across the Southern California raids. “While some of the individuals encountered freely answered questions about their names and place of birth and provided identification documents, others refused to answer questions and/or walked away from the encounters without any further interaction.” Civil rights and immigration lawyers say that armed, masked men forcefully barking questions to vendors or people in a Home Depot parking lot is anything but a consensual interaction. “If they are showing up in places with that display of force and authority and surrounding the people they’re trying to talk to, that’s no longer a consensual encounter,” said Eva Bitran, a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California. In his declaration, Harvick said certain businesses, including car washes, “have been selected for encounters because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations.” Advertisement At least 58 car washes have been hit, some of them more than once, according to the Clean Carwash Worker Center, which has been tracking the raids. During a hearing last month, Frimpong called some of the locations that agents had hit “general” and “not necessarily associated with not having status.” “As they said, bus stop, car wash, tow yard — maybe they’re correlated with people who are low-income or have low income-occupations, maybe they’re correlated with race or ethnicity, but they don’t seem to be correlated with status,” Frimpong said.

Article: “Clean Air Vehicle Decals are a smart, cost-effective incentive that has played an important role driving the adoption of clean and zero-emission vehicles in California,” read a statement from Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Extending the decal program in California — or any other state — would require the approval of Congress and the signature of President Trump, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. “It seems that the only deadline that this Congress responds to are the deadlines that are set by Trump, and I really don’t see him going out of his way to extend this program.” Advertisement Why this state program needs congressional approval Federal legislation has allowed the U.S. Advertisement “Clearly in the early days of zero-emission cars, the carpool lane stickers were an important incentive for some drivers, particularly in places like the Bay Area and Los Angeles where there is major congestion,” Magavern said. “Just like a lot of other incentives, the HOV lane access through the Clean Air Vehicle Program is one of those things that drivers look to to assess the overall package of what it’s like to either go electric or to get that next electric vehicle,” said Alexia Martineau, senior policy manager for Plug In America. What’s being done to extend the life of clean air vehicle decals In an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. “Putting the brakes on this program means that starting October 1, 2025, CAV decals will no longer be valid in California, or elsewhere in the United States,” the Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement. “All vehicles will be required to meet posted vehicle occupancy to travel in carpool lanes and pay required tolls or risk receiving a citation.” According to the California Air Resources Board, there are 519,000 active decals in the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “Now that California has hundreds of thousands of zero-emission vehicles, they can take up a lot of space in the HOV lanes, and those were meant to incentivize people to carpool,” he said. In fact, sales on electric vehicles have been on the rise in the state since 2011, with the exception of stagnant sales between 2018 and 2020, according to a report published by UC Davis. The university’s Electric Vehicle Research Center conducted a survey of drivers from the start of the year until June and found that almost 30% of people said that without any state incentives, including the decal, they wouldn’t have chosen to purchase an electric vehicle, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the center. “Only 8% of the vehicles on the road are electric, and that’s not enough for you to reach the point where the vehicles are a social norm.” The Clean Air Vehicle Decal program is just one way the state is working toward its environmental goals — milestones that have recently come under attack, including California’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards. House voted to prohibit California from banning the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035 and end the state’s ability to set emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and to combat smog levels.

Columbia will pay more than $200 million to the federal government and Brown will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce programs — in addition to promises to share admissions data with federal authorities. The remarks from Newsom were his first public comments about how UC should proceed with Trump, and the first indication — if vague — of how a UC settlement with Trump may or may not look. Advertisement The university system, run by its president and Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution of “all political or sectarian influence.” At at the same time, the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, made the remarks during a media question-and-answer period after an event about artificial intelligence workforce partnerships the state announced with Google, Adobe, IBM and Microsoft. Advertisement Asked about UC’s negotiations, Newsom said, “They’ll do the right thing.” “I have the confidence and I’ll do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.” UC and UCLA spokespeople did not immediately respond Thursday to a question about Newsom’s comments. Milliken said Wednesday that the university system was “agreeing to engage in dialogue with the federal administration” after the Department of Justice sent a letter to UC last week saying it found UCLA had violated the civil rights of Jewish students after activists erected a pro-Palestinian encampment in April 2024. Milliken said the the goal of negotiations was for all “suspended and at-risk federal funding restored to the university as soon as possible.” The grant suspensions affect research into areas including neuroscience, clean energy and cancer. Pam Bondi said on July 28 that UCLA would pay a “heavy price” for acting with “deliberate indifference” to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since Oct. It is in our country’s best interest that funding be restored.” Advertisement In a campuswide letter Wednesday, UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said the grant suspensions were “devastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation.” Times staff writer Taryn Luna contributed to this report.

And in the Cascade Range, which runs into Oregon, fire season now begins 46 days earlier than it once did, according to a study published this week in the journal Science Advances. Advertisement “Anecdotally, those of us living here have this sense that it’s been happening sooner,” said Amanda Fencl, a Berkeley-based water specialist who directs climate science for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists and was not directly involved with the research. “This is really an important study to quantify just how soon and where it is shifting, and to what extent.” Newsletter Toward a more sustainable California Get Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation — and the solution. Although the number of people living in California has grown by roughly 27% since the early 1990s, human-ignited fires have dropped significantly during that time, enabling the researchers to rule out human-caused blazes as the source of the additional burn days. Advertisement “It’s often said we no longer [have] a wildfire season, but that wildfire season is all year, and that’s tied to warming temperatures,” said James Thorne, a UC Davis landscape ecologist who was not involved with the research. More than 220,000 acres have burned in the state as of mid-July, almost 100,000 acres more than California has seen on average at this point in the year over the last five years, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . That total does not include the 96,000 acres burned in the Gifford fire , which was 15% contained as of Thursday, nor three different fires that started Monday in Southern California that together have burned more than 2,800 acres and are not yet contained. In 2018, the year the Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed more people than any wildfire in California history, wildfire damages statewide were an estimated $148.5 billion .

Article: The “Solar for All” program was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribal groups, regions and nonprofits under the Biden administration’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27-billion program geared toward addressing climate change. “One of the more shocking features of Solar For All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through with all of the middlemen taking their own cut — at least 15% by conservative estimates,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ EPA is taking action to end this program for good,” Zeldin added, referring to President Trump’s tax and spending bill he recently signed into law. This week, Los Angeles celebrated the opening of one of the nation’s largest solar and battery power plants, the Eland facility in Kern County, which is now supplying 7% of the city’s power. The California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency were going to oversee and distribute the grant funds, which were particularly focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities and California tribes. Advertisement In a joint statement, the three agencies said the EPA’s termination of Solar for All funding “needlessly increases the cost of community solar and storage projects in California and damages California’s efforts to unleash innovation, train people for today’s energy jobs, and build clean energy projects.” Two nonprofits — the Community Power Coalition and GRID Alternatives — each had $250-million awards for separate efforts to develop community solar and multifamily solar projects across several states, including in California. Climate & Environment California Supreme Court sides with environmental groups in rooftop solar case The California Supreme Court sided with environmental groups in a Thursday ruling, saying that state lawyers were wrong in their claim that the Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives could not be challenged. Estimates were that the program would have saved low-income households $400 a year on electricity bills, created more than 200,000 jobs and eliminated more than 30 million metric tons of air pollution, according to the nonprofit Climate Power. “The Trump administration isn’t just walking away from climate solutions — they’re ripping affordable energy away from the families who need it most.” Trump — who received record donations from fossil fuel companies during his 2024 presidential campaign — is making a number of efforts to slow the transition to clean energy while encouraging the use of fossil fuels, including canceling credits for solar and wind projects by the end of 2027. Advertisement “This latest heist from the Trump administration will cause energy costs to rise, keep Americans beholden to monopolistic electric utilities, and make our grid overburdened and less reliable,” Markey said in a statement. “Trump and Zeldin’s attacks on the Solar for All program and their attempts to cancel legally-binding contracts will mean energy bills are going to continue to spike nationwide.” The program would have created more than $8 billion in overall savings across all 50 states, Markey said. “Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate,” the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency said in their joint statement. “Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects.” The Environmental Protection Network, composed of more than 600 former EPA employees, described the decision as an “abrupt and arbitrary” betrayal of public health, environmental justice and economic opportunity. “Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”

Article: The Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on “roving patrols” implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment. The restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. Advertisement The Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong’s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Lawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration’s arguments. “The brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.” Advertisement The move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck — actions some experts said appeared to violate the court’s order. “I think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.” Advertisement The Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes “manifest irreparable harm” to the government. President Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives. District and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of “Alligator Alcatraz.” But little of the president’s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.

Article: Caught in the middle are a handful of California Republicans, from relative newcomers to seasoned veterans, who represent pockets of the state from the U.S.-Mexico border to the remote forests in the northeast corner. That’s shocking.” The California gerrymandering plan taking shape behind closed doors would increase the Democratic Party’s dominance in the Golden State, adding as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats, according to a draft map reviewed by The Times. That’s what separates what we’re doing from what others are doing.” The proposed boundaries of the new congressional districts continue to shift, but the goal for California Democrats remains the same: Funnel the state’s Republican voters into fewer seats, boost vulnerable Democrats and turn some GOP-dominant districts into narrowly divided toss-ups. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) Kiley represents a sprawling district that runs along the Nevada border from Northern California to Death Valley, cutting through Mammoth and Lake Tahoe and the cities of Roseville, Rocklin and Folsom. He said the bill would “stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.” Newsom, Kiley said, is “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California.” Rep. LaMalfa said in an interview that he had seen one map that shifted his district south to include parts of Sonoma County wine country and shifted some conservative rural areas in the north in another lawmaker’s district. “I hope the weight of how bad this looks collapses on them before we even have to go through these gyrations, and millions and millions of dollars.” He said he was certain that Republicans would litigate the new map if Democrats push ahead. “If they throw me in some wine country district or some coastal district, and that throws me out, then I can go over here and finish cutting apart this tree that fell on my fence last night.” Rep. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster. Valadao represents the California district with the highest percentage of Medicaid recipients, many of whom may lose coverage because of legislation approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump. Calvert said he strongly opposes “the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians” to replace maps drawn by the redistricting commission “with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies.” Deviating from the independent redistricting process “disenfranchises voters and degrades trust in our political system,” Kim said in a statement. She said Newsom should, “for once, focus on addressing the pressing issues making life harder for Californians under his watch instead of trying to position himself for a presidential run.” Newsom this week said he was pleased to see Republican members coming out in support of independent redistricting. A spokesman for Issa declined to comment but referred to a statement from the state’s nine-member Republican delegation, which said that Trump won 38% of the presidential vote in California last year, but Republicans hold fewer than 1 in 5 of the state’s 52 House seats. Newsom, the delegation said, is trying to wrest power from the independent redistricting commission and “place it back into the hands of Sacramento politicians to further his left-wing political agenda.” “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want,” the statement said.

Article: Stanford University’s student newspaper is suing the Trump administration, claiming the threat to deport foreign students for speaking out against Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza is chilling free speech. Some Stanford Daily writers, who are foreigners in the country on student visas, have even turned down assignments to write about unrest in the Middle East because they’re afraid they’ll be deported. The suit accuses Trump administration officials, specifically Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, of placing their statutory authority to deport a foreign visa holder whose beliefs they deem un-American ahead of the constitutional right — guaranteed by the 1st Amendment— to free speech. “When a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights,” the newspaper’s lawyers wrote, “the Constitution prevails.” Advertisement Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, scoffed at the lawsuit, calling it “baseless.” “There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here,” she said in a statement. The lawsuit — which was filed by the 133-year-old student newspaper, not by the university itself — is the most recent salvo in an increasingly bitter fight between Trump and many of the nation’s elite universities. Advertisement His weapon of choice is to threaten to withhold billions of dollars in federal research grants from institutions that refuse to adopt policies on issues such as diversity, transgender rights and Israel that fall in line with his Make America Great Again ideology. Critics call Trump’s campaign an attack on academic freedom, but fearing massive budget cuts, several Ivy League schools — including the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and Brown — have recently cut deals with the Trump administration in an attempt to limit the damage. The Stanford Daily’s lawsuit focuses on two unnamed students, John and Jane Doe, who the paper’s lawyers say began self-censoring out of a well-founded fear of having their visas revoked and being deported. Rubio has claimed that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows the secretary of State to revoke a noncitizen’s legal status if it is decided the person’s actions or statements “compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” Rubio used that interpretation to justify the March arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. Referencing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — which includes Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — the slogan is viewed as a call for freedom and self-determination by Palestinians. As a result, Doe’s profile appeared on the Canary Mission, a pro-Israel website that creators say is devoted to outing “hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews.” Department of Homeland Security officials have acknowledged they consult the website’s profiles — most of which are of students and faculty at elite universities — for information on people worthy of investigation. As a result, since March, Jane Doe has deleted her social media accounts and has “refrained from publishing and voicing her true opinions regarding Palestine and Israel,” the lawsuit claims. John Doe has participated in pro-Palestine demonstrations, has accused Israel of genocide and chanted, “From the river to the sea.” But after the Trump administration started targeting campus demonstrators for deportation, he “refrained from publishing a study containing criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza,” according to the lawsuit.

Article: A rapidly growing wildfire straddling the Ventura-Los Angeles county line Thursday afternoon triggered evacuations in and around Piru and Castaic amid a major heat wave that officials warned could foster extreme fire growth and behavior. Advertisement “Fire conditions are settling down for the night, the air is cooling off, and we continue to have an aggressive fire attack happening, coordinated between ground resources and helicopters,” said Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “So while we certainly have a significant number of people still evacuated and a significant number of residents that are under evacuation orders, we continue to make good progress.” That progress led to an evacuation order in a section of Val Verde being downgraded to an evacuation warning Thursday night, he said. As midnight approached, 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd. “In the area of the fire that’s in Ventura County, we do have four evacuation zones, but it’s a very sparsely populated area, very rural area, and the fire is moving east out of that area,” he said. Both the Ventura and Los Angeles counties’ fire departments were responding to the scene, where crews were facing temperatures up to 100 degrees with wind gusts up to 25 mph, according to the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office. “Our firefighters are working tirelessly in the heat and steep terrain to make that happen.” In Ventura County, evacuation orders were issued for the Lake Piru Recreation Area as well as the communities of Camulos and Piru. (KTLA-TV) Advertisement Fixed-wing firefighter airplanes were grounded shortly around sunset per aviation regulations, but firefighting helicopters will remain at the scene overnight working with ground crews to try to get a handle on the blaze, Dowd said. “We have a quick [water drop] turnaround time because of our proximity to Lake Piru.” Dowd said he was cautiously optimistic that crews would make strong progress on the fire overnight as winds and temperatures died down. “There are light winds that are pushing the fire eastward, but we’re not seeing a significant wind-driven fire like we saw with Palisades or the Eaton fire or the Mountain fire in Ventura County,” he said. “Those were wind-driven fires with long-range spotting that was occurring, and this is much more of a fuel- and terrain- and temperature-driven fire.” California Canyon fire: Evacuation zones, road closures, shelters The Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castaic near the Los Angeles-Ventura county line. “It’s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn’t reach them.” The L.A. “Similar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter in place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,” agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement.

Article: In a Tuesday appearance on CNN’s “The Source,” Wright told CNN host Kaitlan Collins the National Climate Assessments have been removed from government websites “because we’re reviewing them.” “We will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those,” Wright said. The federal reports, prepared by hundreds of volunteer scientists, are subject to extensive peer review and detail how climate change is affecting each region of the United States so far and provide the latest scientific forecasts. Advertisement Wright accused the previous reports of being politically biased, stating that they “are not fair assessments of the data.” “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said. His statements came after the Trump administration in April dismissed more than 400 experts who had already started work on the sixth National Climate Assessment, due for publication in late 2027 or early 2028. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in March proclaimed the administration was “driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” In his CNN appearance, Wright said the previous climate change assessments — including the 2018 report prepared during Trump’s first term — were not “a reasonable representation of broad climate science.” Advertisement “They have been more politically driven to hype up a real issue, but an issue that’s just nowhere near the world’s greatest challenge,” he said of climate change. “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears — that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was among the authors dismissed by the administration. “This is one more alarming example of the Trump administration’s ongoing and highly politicized effort to obfuscate scientific truth to further its dangerous and deadly pro-fossil fuel agenda,” Cleetus said. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, noted in a post on X that the previous National Climate Assessments were authored by hundreds of scientists who were leading domain experts in their fields. Advertisement “This would mark an extraordinary, unprecedented, and alarming level of interference in what has historically been a fair and systematic process,” Swain said of the possibility that previous reports could be altered.

One of California’s most influential labor organizations endorsed redrawing the state’s congressional maps to counter President Trump’s effort to push Republican states, notably Texas, to increase his party’s numbers in Congress in next year’s midterm election. Gavin Newsom and many of the state’s Democratic leaders, would ask voters to temporarily change congressional district boundaries that were drawn by an independent redistricting commission four years ago, with some conditions. “California Labor is unified in our resolve to fight back against President Trump’s anti-worker agenda.” Redistricting — the esoteric redrawing of the nation’s 435 congressional districts — typically occurs once every decade after the U.S. Population shifts can result in changes in a state’s allocation of congressional seats, such as when California lost a seat after the 2020 census the first time in the state’s history. Advertisement The ballot measure being pushed by Newsom and others would allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles if Texas approves a pending measure to reconfigure districts to increase Republican-held congressional seats in that state. The California Federation of Labor is committed to spending several million dollars supporting a mid-decade redistricting ballot measure, on top of what it already planned to spend on competitive congressional races next year, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the strategy. A spokesperson for several organizations devoted to fighting any effort to change the state’s redistricting process said that Charles Munger Jr., the son of a billionaire, and who bankrolled the ballot measure to create the independent commission, is committed to making sure it is not weakened.

Article: Last week, the Department of Insurance ordered the state’s home insurer of last resort to answer allegations that it has handled smoke damage claims illegally, which has prompted policyholder complaints and multiple lawsuits. Advertisement “I’ve spoken with wildfire survivors who would rather lose their homes to flames than endure the stress and confusion of navigating smoke damage claims,” Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. “This is unacceptable.” Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan, said in a statement that the insurer “welcomes the opportunity to engage in this process” and has been working with the department over the past year to “update and clarify its policy language around smoke damage.” Business In landmark decision, judge rules California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy is illegal A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has ruled that the California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy, which limits claims payments by the insurer of last resort, is a violation of state insurance law. The FAIR Plan’s handling of smoke damage claims has angered homeowners who say that instead of being promptly offered industrial hygienic testing for toxic substances and professional cleaning services — even after homes were infiltrated by soot, ash and other fire debris — they were told to try to clean up their properties and given lowball offers to close their claims. Advertisement However, advocates for policyholders have questioned why it took so long for the department to take the action after its own probe in 2022 found 418 violations of state law and the insurance code. Eaton and Palisades fire survivors suffered needlessly under FAIR Plan smoke damage denials because Lara failed to act on the findings of his own investigation,” said Joy Chen, chief executive and co-founder of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a community group formed after the Jan. Harvey Rosenfield, an attorney and founder of Los Angeles advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and a critic of Lara who has accused him of being too chummy with the insurance industry, said the commissioner could have sought an injunction in civil court to halt the alleged illegal claim denials years ago. “It raises the question of Lara’s true intentions, though he could prove us all wrong.” The order to show cause filed by the department accuses the FAIR Plan of denying smoke damage claims through its reliance on illegal policy language adopted in 2017 that requires the claims to show “permanent physical changes” to property. Sanchez said the department has taken a number of escalating legal actions against the FAIR Plan, including holding a 2022 investigative hearing and issuing a May 2025 legal directive declaring the “permanent damage” policy language unlawful and unenforceable. The department’s action follows a landmark pretrial ruling in June by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge that found the language to be illegal in a 2021 case involving a former Mono County homeowner. Since that ruling, however, the plan has continued to reject smoke damage claims based on the 2017 policy language, contending that the decision did not set a precedent, said Dylan Schaffer, an attorney who handled the case. “It remains to be seen whether the department’s action that should have been taken in 2022 will do anything to help consumers, including those impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires,” he added. Amy Bach, an attorney and executive director of United Policyholders, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it is important that the department work with Schaffer and other attorneys who have already filed lawsuits against the plan.

Article: In his efforts to look like a “fighter” ahead of a potential run for the presidency in 2028, he’s willing to ignore democratic rules in pursuit of political aims, setting aside the state’s independent redistricting system to counter Texas Republicans’ proposed partisan gerrymander. In 2008 and 2010, California voters passed ballot initiatives that gave the power to draw the state’s legislative and congressional district lines to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a 14-person independent body composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people who are registered with neither of the two major parties. Potential commissioners go through an extensive vetting and selection process (which the state Legislature participates in) and are prohibited from many forms of political activism, including donating to candidates, running for office or working for elected officials. Since the latest redistricting, in 2021 — triggered as usual by the constitutionally mandated decennial census — the map crafted by the commission has survived legal and political challenges, and the current districts are set to be in place through the next round of redistricting in 2031. Now Newsom wants to prematurely redraw the lines and craft his own partisan gerrymander for the November 2026 midterm elections, wresting control of the process away from the commission and giving it instead to the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. Last week, Newsom confirmed that he will call a special election to get voter approval for this end-run around the commission, but even dressed up with a vote, this is cynical politics, not democracy, at work. Greg Abbott and President Trump are backing to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress from that state, and in turn, to enhance the party’s chances to retain control of the U.S. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) calls the Texas action a “Trumpian power grab,” and Newsom assails it as the “rigging of the system by the president of the United States.” (Recent public opinion research conducted by Newsom’s pollster revealed that the public is more likely to support a California redistricting maneuver if the fight has Trump, not Texas, as the central villain.) But two wrongs don’t make a right. A key difference between the proposed line redrawing in Texas and the California plan is that the former, however brazen, is legal and precedented, while the latter specifically contravenes California law and the expressed will of the state’s voters. To add insult to injury, the cost of the special election to ratify the scheme is estimated to be about $60 million in Los Angeles County alone, with statewide costs likely exceeding $200 million.

Schaben / Los Angeles Times) On July 29, the three unions representing probation employees sent a letter to Horvath accusing her of “reckless, union-busting rhetoric” and ignoring state law that protects members’ collective bargaining rights. “If the Court appoints the Receiver, we will hold him accountable to state law and to the terms of our contract.” Absent some sweeping new power, Probation Chief Guillermo Viera Rosa warns, the receiver will run into the same obstacles as every other chief. “Simply having a receiver saying do X, Y and Z isn’t going to change anything unless they have explicit powers that I haven’t had or that the county hasn’t been able to implement because of, for example, the civil service or unions,” Viera Rosa said. “If it’s simply additional oversight and putting another person to simply have a separate budget, but no new ideas or powers, then it’s a critical mistake.” Advertisement And potentially a costly one. County Chief Executive Fesia Davenport warned her bosses at a meeting last week that handing financial control to a receiver could have “significant impacts” to the county’s finances, which already have been wrecked with federal cuts , a $4-billion sex abuse settlement and costly labor negotiations . “If a receiver can cut through the red tape that has stalled past reform efforts, then it’s a step worth taking.” Soon after taking the job in 2023, Viera Rosa diagnosed his ailing department with a “call out culture.” Employees scheduled to work often didn’t show up for their shifts. “You’re going to have to give the receiver the authority to suspend contracts — whether it’s employment contracts, union contracts, broad authority to suspend civil service rules — just a tremendous amount of authority to really move the needle on this.” Advertisement That’s what happened in Cook County, the only juvenile detention facility in America to go into a receivership. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Bonta’s office said in a statement the receiver will have the power to hire and fire staffers and “all other necessary decisions for compliance.” “If the receivership is approved, the receiver would have the power to negotiate or renegotiate contracts and to petition the court to waive a contractual obligation in certain circumstances,” the his office said in a statement. “Even in a federal receivership, they’ve sort of left the contracts alone,” said Don Specter, a senior staff attorney with the Prison Law Office, whose Supreme Court case focused on inadequate medical care for California prisoners led to a receiver.

Article: A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who shot a man in the back in 2021 will not face criminal charges, according to records made public by the district attorney’s office late last month. Los Angeles County prosecutors found there was “insufficient evidence” to prove Deputy Yen Liu was not acting in lawful self-defense when he shot Adrian Abelar at a Rosemead auto body shop four years ago, firing a round that fractured several vertebrae and nearly paralyzed him, according to court records and Abelar’s attorney. Deputies were responding to reports that Abelar — a convicted felon who could not legally possess a firearm — had threatened to shoot several people at the auto body shop. In video from the incident, deputies can be heard shouting, “Gun!” right before Liu closes in on Abelar, whose right arm is clearly outstretched and empty at the time Liu opens fire. Advertisement “Since one reasonable interpretation of the evidence leads to the conclusion that Liu acted in response to an apparent danger, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Liu did not act in self-defense when he shot Abelar in the back,” prosecutors wrote in a 10-page declination memo made public in late July. There were only four other cases since 2013 in which more than two years elapsed between a deputy-involved shooting and a charging decision being made by prosecutors, according to a 2021 report by the L.A. He claimed the investigation was “purposefully stalled for more than two years.” Advertisement Liu has returned to active duty and is assigned to the Temple Station, where he worked when the shooting occurred, according to Nicole Nishida, a sheriff’s department spokeswoman. “The guy clearly does not have a weapon in his hand and the deputy who is on top of him draws his firearm, jams it in the guy’s back and fires it immediately upon contact,” said Ed Obayashi, a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff’s deputy who advises police departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents. According to recordings made public by law enforcement, Doktor said Abelar arrived at his shop that day demanding car repairs because he was fleeing from the cops due to an active murder warrant. While living on the street, Abelar was arrested last May on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, resisting arrest and having a forged driver’s license, records show.

Article: Not present, but hailed by Trump during the presser as an “MVP candidate,” was Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who has made it his life’s mission to crush the multicultural metropolis that birthed him. So what did Wasserman, a prominent Democratic donor who in recent months has thrown some cash at Republican committees, do in front of people who want to rain holy hell on his hometown? If that wasn’t groveling enough, Wasserman was grinning after Trump joked about not using an autopen to sign the executive order creating the task force — a jab at President Biden. the way he did this summer, Trump responded, “We’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?” With the Games happening in a presidential election year, Trump would love nothing more than to traipse around an L.A. And you definitely don’t entrust kiss asses like Wasserman — I’m still not sure what he did to deserve his powerful LA28 gig, except being the grandson of the late Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman — with calming down someone like Trump.

Article: Gavin Newsom calls the “labyrinth of manual verification,” which involves Medi-Cal recipients proving every six months that they are working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours per month. It’s relatively uncharted territory, and it’s not yet clear how the rules will shake out for the 5.1 million people in California who will be required to prove that they are working in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid. Advertisement After the 2026 midterm elections, millions of healthy adults will be required to prove every six months that they meet the work requirement in order to qualify for Medicaid. The rule applies to those whose income is between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty limit, a group that became eligible for Medicaid when the program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. But those programs were brief, overturned by the courts and weren’t “a coordinated effort among the states to figure out what the best practices are,” said Ryan Long, the director of congressional relations at the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that has become influential among congressional Republicans. Arguments from liberal groups that people will lose healthcare are a “straw man argument,” Long said: “They know that the public supports work requirements for these benefits, so they can’t come out and say, ‘We don’t support them.’” A poll by the health research group KFF found this year that 62% of American adults support tying Medicaid eligibility to work requirements. The poll also found that support for the policy drops to less than 1 in 3 people when respondents hear “that most people on Medicaid are already working and many would risk losing coverage because of the burden of proving eligibility through paperwork.” In June, Newsom warned that some Californians could be forced to fill out 36 pages of paperwork to keep their insurance, showing reporters an image of a stack of forms with teal and gold accents that he described as “an actual PDF example of the paperwork that people will have to submit to for their eligibility checks.” Many Californians already are required to fill out that 36-page form or its online equivalent to enroll in Medi-Cal and Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace. Two years ago, the state made healthcare available to people who were working at least 80 hours per month and earned less than the federal poverty limit (about $15,000 for one person or $31,200 for a household of four). The Medicaid program has cost more than $100 million so far, and of that, $26 million was spent on health benefits and more than $20 million was allocated to marketing contracts, KFF Health News reported. Advertisement The Inland Empire agency that provides Medi-Cal coverage for about 1.5 million people in San Bernardino and Riverside counties estimated that 150,000 members could lose their insurance as a result of work requirements. Jarrod McNaughton, the chief executive of the Inland Empire Health Plan, said that California’s 58 counties, which administer Medi-Cal, “will be the ones at the precipice of piecing this together” but haven’t yet received guidance on how the eligibility process will be set up or what information people will have to provide.

Article: Arrests of undocumented immigrants have dropped significantly across the Los Angeles region two months after the Trump administration launched its aggressive mass deportation operation, according to new figures released Wednesday by Homeland Security. “Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. White House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around “sanctuary” jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. “If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote, “they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.” It’s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: “From the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.”

Article: President Trump signed an executive order yesterday instructing the Department of Labor to review its guidance on historically riskier investment markets, like private equity, real estate, and crypto, for employers and retirement plan administrators. An executive order won’t update your retirement account dashboard directly, but it will urge the Labor Department and other government agencies to make it easier for your nest egg to include alternative assets. Right now, no law prohibits employers and plan sponsors from offering these kinds of assets, but they are required to act as fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal and ethical duty to protect investors: Traditionally, plan sponsors have been extremely conservative about including anything that could get them sued, especially when it comes to deciding what investment options are available through your 401(k). Most of the groups advocating for these assets to be included in 401(k) investments are the ones that would benefit from gaining access to the roughly $12.2 trillion currently in retirement funds.

Article: President Trump alleged that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America—the two biggest banks in the US—refused to handle more than $1 billion of his money after his first term, the president said in an interview with CNBC yesterday. Per the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s claims could serve as the catalyst for an executive order as early as this week designed to punish the banking industry for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. Reputational risk Per Reuters, during the Biden administration, regulators were able to ask banks why they were providing services to Trump in spite of the “reputational risk” issue, which is a way for banks to turn away customers or entities who could hurt the bank’s image. Thus, this is one area where Trump and the banks now appear aligned: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Trump is “after the right thing, which is the laws, rules, and regulations around our industry.” Zoom out: While banks legally can’t say “your money is no good here” because of political affiliation, they can say it if, for instance, someone has been convicted of fraud.

Article: Like a straight-A student living the nightmare that their teacher called their parents to say they’re on the verge of failing math, famously conflict-avoidant Switzerland is racing against the clock to get out of the fight President Trump picked with the country last week. The trade barrier—which one Swiss newspaper called the country’s biggest defeat since France beat it in the Battle of Marignano in 1515—came after a phone call between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter last week. The country’s leaders are now getting flak for bungling talks and are working to change Trump’s mind before the new tariff rate is slated to kick in on August 7. Switzerland’s claim to fame as a top-shelf goods supplier is what made it a target for some of Trump’s heaviest tariffs: The land of bougie chocolate and watches has the 13th-largest annual trade surplus with the US, amounting to $38 billion last year. Though a chunk of that comes from Swiss gold exports (the country is a major transit point for the precious metal), some local business leaders blamed the country’s pharma giants for inspiring Trump’s ire. Even though pharma is currently exempt from the import duty, Switzerland-based Novartis and Roche’s US subsidiary Genentech were among the major pharma purveyors that POTUS recently gave 60 days to lower drug prices. But Switzerland’s business minister Guy Parmelin said the country could try to win Trump over by offering to buy more American liquefied natural gas or ramping up investments in the US economy.—SK

Article: Last night, with a self-imposed midnight deadline looming for the end of the tariff pause, meaning countries that hadn’t reached a new trade deal with the US would get turned into a pumpkin slapped with higher tariffs, President Trump rolled out new tariffs to be imposed on imports from dozens of countries—but pushed off their implementation until Aug. A senior US official told Bloomberg that the rates fell into roughly three groups: 10% for countries where the US has a trade surplus, 15% for those where the US has a small trade deficit, and higher for countries with a large deficit or that didn’t strike deals: For countries that did make deals–including Japan, Britain, the EU, Indonesia, and South Korea—the order appears to reflect the tariffs that were agreed to, even though the details are still being worked out. Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25%, but that this would exclude any goods covered by the trade deal he brokered with Canada and Mexico during his first term. There’s no getting around them: The order imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods deemed “transhipped,” which means made in one country with components from another to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile…a federal appeals court appeared skeptical yesterday of Trump’s legal power to set tariffs without congressional approval while hearing the Justice Department’s appeal of a federal trade court’s May ruling that struck down the tariffs (but was then halted).

Zuck said he envisions a future where everyone can have “a personal superintelligence,” ideally built into smart glasses, “that helps you achieve your goals.” To make the dream a reality, Meta has gone on an expensive talent-poaching spree in recent weeks: Meta has hired ~50 top AI scientists, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT co-creator, for its new superintelligence lab, according to the Financial Times.

Article: Energy costs are rising this summer, and it’s not entirely because you’re sitting in front of your air conditioner for 16 hours a day wondering why people prefer this season over winter. No, it’s mostly due to the prevalence of AI data centers, the power-sucking buildings that allow users to ask generative AI bots like Grok if something is true: PJM Interconnection provides electricity to 13 states and Washington, DC, and is considered a bellwether for the rest of the US.

Article: And: Boeing shipped 280 commercial airplanes in the first six months of 2025, the biggest delivery number for the first half of any year since 2018, when it was last profitable. The industry veteran inherited a mess worse than a lavatory after a 14-hour flight when he stepped into the role last summer, amid regulatory scrutiny over safety lapses and just before a nearly two-month strike in the fall that hampered assembly lines and, consequently, Boeing’s cash flow. But Ortberg said recently that 2025 can be the company’s “turnaround year.” In Q2, Boeing ramped up production of its best-selling 737 Max aircraft to 38 per month—the legal limit set by federal regulators—and it aims to get permission to bump that to 42 soon. Looking ahead…to convert its $522 billion order backlog into more revenue, the planemaker needs the government to green-light more of its plane models, but the target for getting the new Boeing 737 Max 7 and Max 10 certified was pushed back from this year to 2026.

It’s a new world(wide web) in the UK Websites with content deemed inappropriate—including Reddit, Bluesky, and PornHub—have introduced age-verification checks designed to keep out anyone under 18 in the UK, as required by the recently implemented law. The law is mainly intended to shield minors from pornography and anything that promotes eating disorders or self-harm, but critics aren’t sure this is the best way to go about it: Some sites ask for selfies, videos, or photos of IDs to check users’ ages, which has privacy experts worried about potential data breaches, since an age verification platform used by TikTok, Uber, and X left personal info exposed last year, according to 404 Media. Some tricksters have gotten creative: Gamers who didn’t want to hand over a facial scan figured out that they could get past Reddit and Discord’s age-verification checks by pointing their phone cameras at the face of the main character in Death Stranding.

Article: The parents in 19 Kids and Counting probably wish they lived in China, where the government will pay families $500 a year per baby until the child turns three, state media reported yesterday. The cash is meant to be a birthing incentive to remedy the country’s ongoing population decline, which threatens to undermine its economy: China’s fertility rate dropped from 2.51 children per woman in 1990 to 1.01 last year, well below the 2.1 rate needed to maintain a stable population. Local governments in China already offer their own baby bucks incentives, with the capital of the Inner Mongolia region offering the most generous subsidy of up to $14,000 per child. The Trump administration has reportedly considered a $5,000 “baby bonus,” and the recently passed Republican tax bill included the government funding a $1,000 investment account for babies born through 2028.

Article: After an hourlong meeting, the pair emerged with what Trump called “the biggest deal ever made.” The European Union’s 27 countries will be charged a baseline tariff of 15% on most exports. Europe wanted a zero-to-zero tariff deal or a 10% rate, like the UK negotiated, but ended up with less than the 20% tariff Trump originally announced in April and the 30% rate he floated on July 12. “It is the best we could get,” von der Leyen said, acknowledging that the negotiations started from “an imbalance,” a reference to the US’ significant trade deficit with the EU. However, von der Leyen said that the 15% rate would not stack on top of industry-specific tariffs already in place, and that the deal provided “stability” and “predictability” for the EU. No written documents were immediately provided with the announcement, and more details will likely be clarified this week, but the biggest takeaways yesterday were: The 50% tariff on steel from Europe remains in place.

The legal standard could make proving Tesla’s liability difficult: As The Verge reported, it’s likely an uphill climb for the plaintiffs, since the court is using Florida’s standard, which is “whether the car manufacturer exhibited a reckless disregard for human life equivalent to manslaughter by designing and marketing the vehicle.” As for other states…few have language on the books to determine who is liable in the case of an autonomous vehicle accident. Bottom line: Should Tesla lose this case, it could hurt the company’s reputation and further damage its already flagging sales, as the company has staked its future on growing its robotaxi fleet.—DL

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — After weeks of protests following a six-alarm fire at The Cooper Apartments, dozens of tenants displaced by that fire have filed a lawsuit against the complex seeking damages. According to a press release from Varghese Summersett, the Texas law firm representing the tenants in the case, some residents have been told they'll never be allowed to access their apartment or belongings, losing irreplaceable possessions and critical documents. This is cruelty piled on top of catastrophe.” In addition to the apartment complex, the apartment owner, the property management, the electrical contractor, the owner of the electrical contractor and the electrician on site that day are all listed as defendants in the suit. “I have to live with that for the rest of my life.” Another plaintiff, Zaire Harris, described the uncertainty and stress of going weeks without basic needs or access to his home. “Fluffy words, very little action.” Attorney Katie Steele, who is representing a growing group of 49 former residents, said her clients were not only displaced but also denied basic tenant rights. "I hope we get to the bottom of what happened and how it got to be so bad." Steele has also reportedly sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction of any portions of the apartment complex in order to preserve evidence. A spokesperson for The Cooper said in a statement to WFAA, "We are reviewing the allegations in the lawsuit and are unable to comment." A resident of The Cooper Apartments, who is among the complainants in the suit, shared a lease termination notice dated July 31, 2025, which said the following: The lease is terminated, effective seven days after the date of the letter Leases terminated Aug. 7 as notice was sent July 31 Tenants cannot access the apartment to retrieve their belongings because the building is structurally unsafe, all personal belongings were destroyed in fire and the units are too toxic Tenants will be refunded pro-rated rent from the date of the fire to the lease termination date as well as all deposits All remaining personal property will be thrown away, citing it as a health and safety hazard According to the Fort Worth Fire Department, the fire was reported around 1:30 p.m.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn't distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba's speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: ATLANTA — The Detroit Lions said safety Morice Norris was in stable condition after he was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions’ preseason game Friday night against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support.” Lions coach Dan Campbell asked for prayers for the 24-year-old Norris. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back’s midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we’ve all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.” When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board.” Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. “We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone’s eyes and see that.” Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

Article: City officials faced significant challenges preparing the budget, as Dallas grapples with a lower-than-expected sales tax revenue report, an increase in home appraisal appeals and a voter-approved mandate to hire hundreds of new police officers. In addition, Dallas increased the property tax exemption for seniors aged 65 and older or residents with disabilities for the seventh year in a row, raising it from $153,400 to $175,000. "This budget reflects a reimagining of service delivery, the elimination of duplications, the optimization of operational efficiencies and other measures that maintain responsiveness to the needs of the city." Budget Highlights: Keep Dallas safe by hiring 350 police recruits and retaining seasoned officers to end FY 2025-26 with 3,424 officers, the highest number since 2016.

Article: 15 over claims that it has become "the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. Asana Partners, a real estate investment firm that owns several properties in the neighborhood — including some near the popular but controversial bar Rodeo Dallas — has filed for a temporary restraining order to have Rodeo's doors shut for the second time this week, according to court documents obtained by WFAA. Before the weekend began, Asana Partners filed the restraining order against Rodeo Ranch Texas LLC on Friday, accusing the bar of being “the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” "The wrongful activities emanating from Rodeo Dallas are egregious -- unfettered violence, drug use, displays of firearms, underage drinking, excessively loud music, massive uncontrollable crowds and murder," Asana Partners said in the original petition for the restraining order. "Deep Ellum as a whole is flourishing, but the ongoing operation of Rodeo Dallas must be immediately retrained to prevent further irreparable harm to [Asana Partners] and the entire Deep Ellum community." On Tuesday, WFAA spoke with nearby business owners and employees, many of whom celebrated the initial closure, calling it a win for the neighborhood. It's worth noting that a situation like this, where neighboring landlords file restraining orders to shutter businesses, is unprecedented for Deep Ellum, let alone a landlord locking out its tenant, which consistently ranks in the top 15 of alcohol sales for all of Dallas, according to the state. A sign was left on the door stating, "You will be missed." Managing Director of Asset Management for Asana Partners, Chris Dalton, provided the following statement on the temporary restraining order: "At today's 3pm hearing in the 44th District Court in Dallas County, Judge Veretta Frazier ruled in favor of the Temporary Restraining Order filed by Asana Partners against Rodeo Dallas. We thank and are encouraged by Judge Veretta Frazier and the 44th District Court for supporting efforts to protect Deep Ellum and the people who visit, work, and live there." Frazier listened to arguments from attorneys for Rodeo and Asana Partners Friday afternoon. "They want to pump as much alcohol into young folks as they can, and there are no concerns whatsoever for the ramifications or for anyone who lives in this community," attorney Ben Riemer said in court on behalf of Asana Partners. Dave Wishnew, an attorney for Rodeo, fought back, saying Asana Partners isn't representing the city or a community -- only business as a whole in the area and that Asana Partners is not aware of what Rodeo is doing to remedy issues with its landlord, Westdale, or the city. The city attorney of Dallas sent Rodeo a warning letter on July 30, listing several code violations that Rodeo had committed, such as operating as a restaurant rather than a bar, lacking a dance-hall license, and running a mechanical bull without a permit. Measures are in place for this weekend, and nobody is inviting crime into this business." Wishnew also stressed that the bar has no control over what people do outside of it and only inside of it, noting that over a dozen crimes the city connected to the establishment in the letter were never committed on the premises.

Article: Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. Bush said in a statement Friday night that Webster's “passion for the rule of law and for the greatness of America made him a model public servant.” President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

Article: Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth. You can't project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path,” said David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, science team leader for the Hubble observations. Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles (tens of kilometers) across, but Hubble’s observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers).

Article: — A man suspected in a shooting at a Montana bar that left four people dead was captured Friday just a few miles from where the shooting happened after hundreds of law enforcement officers spent the past week scouring nearby mountainsides, authorities said. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a news conference that about 130 law enforcement officers made a hard push Thursday after getting tips that helped verify they were looking in the right area. Greg Gianforte first confirmed Brown’s capture on social media Friday afternoon, saying it was the result of what he called a “Herculean effort” from law enforcement officers across the state. The community finally would be able to sleep tonight, Anaconda-Deer Valley County Attorney Morgan Smith said, adding that the case is just the beginning for prosecutors who will be seeking to charge Brown with the killings. Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, said search teams found Brown at a structure near The Ranch Bar and that he looked to be “in pretty good shape, physically.” He was communicative and able to identify himself, Johnson said. Eric Hempstead, who owns The Ranch Bar, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) west of The Owl Bar, described an intense law enforcement presence in the densely wooded area over the last couple of days that involved search dogs and drones. Brown, who lived next door to The Owl Bar in Anaconda, served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005. The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Law Enforcement Department did not respond this week to several email and phone messages requesting records of the welfare checks Boyle said they helped conduct on Brown in the years leading up to the shooting.

He also said he and his client are in it "for the long fight and look forward to their day in court." The lawsuit was filed in Dallas County in September 2020 against Jones and the Dallas Cowboys by a woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe, who alleged in the lawsuit that Jones forcibly grabbed her and kissed her on the mouth in September 2018. The initial lawsuit didn’t detail where the alleged incident happened, but in a refiled version of the lawsuit, she alleged it happened in the Tom Landry room at AT&T Stadium.

Article: In the video, Thalia Salinas, 23, sits surrounded by her four closest friends — Ruby Cruz, Brianna Valadez, Jackie Velazco and Desiree Cervantes — as they sing to her, celebrating another year of life. On July 25, the longtime friends were heading to the lake when, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, a Dodge Ram 4500 pulling a horse trailer swerved into oncoming traffic on U.S. "I gave each one of them their last hug, and I truly… I’m glad I did.” Ruby’s younger sister, Ana Cruz, said her final conversation with her sister came just hours before the crash. "Those were the last words that came out of my mouth that I loved.” Thalia’s older brother, Sal Salinas, remembers the constant energy and noise in their home when the girls were together. "Her favorite things to do were go to the beach, go to the lake, anything water… all five of them are regularly at her house… just watching videos, listening to music, a bunch of random laughter very loud through the walls here.” Anger over driver leaving scene without testing The driver accused of causing the crash, 37-year-old Kody Talley, was not tested for drugs or alcohol before being released from the scene, despite having what the families say is a lengthy and troubling criminal record. Commercial driving questions: At the time of the crash, Talley was reportedly driving for his father’s company, hauling a trailer loaded with horses — something the families say raises questions about whether he should have been behind the wheel at all, given his history.

Article: WYLIE, Texas — If students at Wylie High School don't comply with a new state law about the use, or more accurately, the lack of use, of their cell phones and other communication devices, they will be sent to see Student Services Secretary Beth McPherson. "I give them the top copy," she said, tearing off a duplicate receipt at her desk in a small office off the main hallway at the high school of approximately 3,000 students. Wylie ISD, like all other school districts across Texas, is working to comply with House Bill 1481, which requires all school districts and open-enrollment charter schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal communication devices (cell phones, personal iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) while on school property during the school day. "The first day I was reaching, like where's my phone," said Wylie High School junior Julia Hudgins, admitting that it was a bit of an adjustment on Thursday, the first day of the school year. "There are some people that are just on their phones 24/7, sit in the back, take naps, just do whatever," Wylie High senior Eli Martin said of previous school years. "But now that's gone, I see them like they're sitting up, they're paying attention now." School districts are making exceptions for students who might need their phones to monitor glucose levels for diabetes or need them to operate hearing aid devices.

Article: Well, the implementation of that law -- which was passed by the Texas Legislature this year -- might vary from district to district, even if the intended effect is still the same: Students won't be able to use their phones in school. Here are the policies that several larger districts in North Texas have passed: Dallas ISD The new DISD policy bans cell phone use all day and includes escalating levels of punishment for each violation: 1st violation – phone confiscated, returned to parent/guardian 2nd – returned with $5 fee 3rd – returned with $10 fee 4th – returned with $15 fee The district decided that elementary teachers will collect cell phones and secure them during the day, and secondary campuses will give students a pouch to store their devices. Arlington ISD The Arlington district announced an "Away for the Day" cell phone policy, requiring students' personal devices -- including smartwatches, cell phones and tablets -- to be powered off and "out of sight" during all parts of the school day, including class time, transition between classes and at lunch. The police comes with four levels of discipline for each time a student violates the policy, from device confiscation and contacting a parent (first offense) to in-school suspension (third offense) and then, on a fourth violation, an assignment to the district's Choices program. Plano ISD The Plano district passed a policy requiring students to have all personal communication devices powered off and stored out of sight in their backpacks from the time they enter the building until they leave for the day. Duncanville ISD Duncanville students will have to power off their devices all day, although each individual campus will decide how the devices will be stored, according to the district's policy. Allen ISD Allen students will not be allowed to use phones or other communication devices from the time they arrive at school until they leave, including passing periods and at lunch, the new policy says.

Article: DALLAS — California Congressman Kevin Kiley, R- District 3, is one of the many Republicans who doesn't agree with any effort to redistrict mid-decade, like what is happening in Texas. And now that leaders in Democrat-run states such as California, Illinois and New York, are threatening to redraw their congressional lines to ice out the GOP, many blue state Republicans such as Kiley are growing increasingly alarmed that their seats will suddenly become vulnerable. Gavin Newsom for “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California,” the Republican did acknowledge to us that the fight started with Texas Republicans.

Article: HOUSTON — Billy Howton, a former Green Bay Packers star regarded as one of the most productive wide receivers of the pre-Super Bowl era who was a founder and the first president of the NFL Players Association, has died. Because of Billy’s advocacy as our first president, today’s players have a pension, disability benefits & a voice of their own in the business of football.” Howton scored the Packers' first receiving touchdown at Lambeau Field in 1957. He holds Green Bay's single-game franchise record with 257 receiving yards in a 1956 game against the Los Angeles Rams, and when he retired in 1963, he was the NFL's all-time leading receiver in receptions (503) and receiving yards (8,459). “For my money, Howton is the toughest pass receiver to cover in the National League,” Hall of Fame safety Emlen Tunnell said before the 1958 season, which was Howton’s last with the Packers. “He was an extremely dangerous receiver and had great technique.” After seven years in Green Bay, Howton was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1959 and then to Dallas as a member of the Cowboys' inaugural team in 1960. He represented the Packers at the first NFLPA meeting in 1956 and brought with him a list of four grievances that famously included a need for clean towels, shirts and jock straps for second practices — when NFL teams held two practices a day. He was elected as the organization's first president in 1958 and threatened to bring an antitrust suit against the NFL if it didn't establish a pension plan for retired players.

Article: Gavin Newsom, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and others about GOP-led redistricting efforts in Texas and a responding redistricting effort in heavily-Democratic California. "We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all." Pelosi introduced California Gov. Newsom likewise called the Texas Democratic lawmakers' efforts and California's potential redistricting efforts bids to "defend democracy." "We are trying to defend democracy as opposed to see it destroyed district by district, and we will stand firm," Newsom said. We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people and that's the difference between the approach we're taking and the approach they're taking." Watch Friday's full press conference below Newsom said he's calling for a special election in California in November, and the California Legislature has until Aug. In response to a question about how voters can be confident California's redistricting effort would be a "one-time exception" to California's independent redistricting commission, Newsom offered the following statement: "I'd say we want to do it for the '26, '28, '30 ballots just for congressional representatives alone. What is happening in Texas, what is being pushed out by the Trump administration beyond Texas, is something we thought we would never see where people's lives, their representation, their participation is willingly stifled, violently stifled," California Assembly Member Isaac Bryan said. "This is not just about lines on the map, this is about lives on the line.” Ahead of the press conferences, the Texas House again failed to establish quorum Friday, as our sister station KVUE reported. In addition to daily fines, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that he and Comptroller Kelly Hancock have enacted a new policy to prevent the absent lawmakers from having their paycheck, or per diem, deposited electronically. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also filed a lawsuit Friday in a bid for the Supreme Court of Texas to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic state representatives who left the state. I have asked the Texas Supreme Court to declare what has been clear from the beginning: that the runaway members have officially vacated their offices in the Texas House.” In addition to filing the petition, Paxton and Burrows moved to enforce civil arrest warrants in other states.

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. Lovell and fellow astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert received renewed fame with the retelling of the Apollo 13 mission in the 1995 movie “Apollo 13" where actor Tom Hanks — portraying Lovell — famously said, “Houston, we have a problem.” In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death affected him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises.” Lovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn't display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. I measure risk.'” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “He was a member of really the first generation of American astronauts and went on to inspire multiple generations of Americans to look at the stars and want to explore,” said Bruce McClintock, who leads the RAND Corp. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn't have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA's historian. Lovell showed a “leadership role and heroic efforts in the recovery of Apollo 13.” By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Before Long's confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS.

Article: MCALLEN, Texas — A judge on Friday was considering a Trump administration request to end a decades-old policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody that the government says is inhibiting its immigration crackdown. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.” “It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Detroit safety Morice Norris was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions' preseason game against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. ATLANTA, Georgia -- Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. "It's never good when they bring out the stretchers."

Article: That particular wave is just coming off the coast of Africa, meaning that even if it were to eventually impact the U.S., it wouldn't be for another 10 to 12 days, giving us plenty of time to keep a watchful eye on it. August 3 There is now a low chance for development over the eastern Atlantic as a tropical wave is expected to move off the coast of Africa in the next day or two. July 29 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms and two named storms, the Atlantic Basin remains quiet for now with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 28 Update While the central and eastern Pacific basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements." One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times - Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 - with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame - thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions - and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission - immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell - that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Hanks posted a tribute to Lovell on Instagram Friday, writing, "There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive - and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: Judge weighs Trump administration's request to end protections for immigrant children MCALLEN, Texas -- A judge on Friday was considering a Trump administration request to end a decades-old policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody that the government says is inhibiting its immigration crackdown. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they "are deteriorating." "It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it's willful," said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," where a lawsuit alleges detainees' constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump's tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Article: A shooting outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters on Friday left a police officer dead and officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency shaken. Citing a senior law enforcement official, The New York Times reported the shooter, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was fixated on the Covid vaccine, which he blamed for his health problems. In response to the shooting and reports of White’s motivations, newly appointed CDC Director Susan Monarez convened an online all-hands meeting of the agency division that focuses on vaccines — the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It is not fair to all of you who’ve given so much to contribute to public health,” Monarez told employees during the meeting Saturday, according to a recording reviewed by MSNBC. One said they felt like “sitting ducks.” As the leaders spoke, dozens of staffers posted messages in the meeting chat, many naming Kennedy, who oversees the CDC at the Department of Health and Human Services, citing his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines and vilifying the health agencies he now leads. One employee described the shooting as “the culmination of ongoing animosity toward CDC and the work that we do — not a one-off incident.” Another named Kennedy in a comment that drew dozens of supportive emoji reactions, writing: “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation. In videos from anti-vaccine conferences between 2013 and 2019, he likened the agency’s vaccine work to “fascism” and “child abuse,” called it a “cesspool of corruption” and said it was filled with profiteers. At a 2013 conference, when asked about why the CDC had failed to acknowledge the autism epidemic (which he falsely linked to vaccines), Kennedy said it was like the Holocaust. During the pandemic, Kennedy repeatedly framed the CDC and other HHS agencies as “corrupt,” falsely suggested Covid-19 was a “bioweapon,” and lied about the dangers of Covid vaccines, calling them “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” “The hatred RFK and his allies have spent their lives stoking puts a target on the backs of anyone in public health,” said one senior official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the agency and so they could speak critically about Kennedy. Monarez called it “a good question” and said the CDC had been in “constant communication” with his office and that “more will be coming.” Kennedy did post a message of support to the CDC from his HHS account shortly after the meeting. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.” The shooting marks a low point in an already dark period for public health.

Article: Temperatures will hit the triple digits in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys on Thursday, while interior regions of Los Angeles County will see temperatures in the 90s, according to the National Weather Service. California California fires are burning and incoming heat wave could make things worse A widespread heat wave is expected to intensify fire concerns across California as temperatures rise and landscapes further dry out. “A slight cooling trend is [forecast for] Friday through the weekend but temperatures will remain above normal away from the immediate coast well into next week.” Advertisement The sustained hot weather will continue to dry out vegetation, increasing the risk of wildfire starts and worsening conditions around blazes already burning across Central and Southern California, including the state’s largest this year: the 96,106-acre Gifford fire in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, quickly grew to more than 1,000 acres, prompting evacuation orders in Piru, Castaic, Val Verde and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles county fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by onshore winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour, according to Cal Fire and the National Weather Service. Conditions on Thursday will be even hotter in the Inland Empire and inland areas of San Diego County, where the weather service has issued regional heat advisories through Friday evening. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, grew to 600 acres in a little over an hour prompting evacuation orders in nearby communities of Piru, Castiac, Val Verde, and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles County fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by on shore winds, according to Cal Fire. “We’ll have pretty gusty onshore winds, anywhere from 15 to 25 miles an hour, with gusts to 20 to 40 across the interior locations each afternoon and evening, strongest across the I-5 corridor, Antelope Valley and southwest Santa Barbara County coast,” Black said. “With that, we’ll have an extended period of elevated fire weather risk.” California is already on pace for the worst wildfire year in recent history, driven by several large fires in Central and Southern California — including the Gifford fire and the devastating January firestorms in Los Angeles County. Advertisement As of Thursday morning, the Gifford fire was 15% contained, according to federal officials, after hot conditions and continued fire growth challenged firefighters and triggered additional evacuation orders and warnings for rural communities near the Los Padres National Forest.

Article: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel’s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in what local media called one of the largest anti-government protests in recent months following 22 months of war. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Health officials said that 20 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours, as the criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food to reach people in the besieged enclave. ‘Shut the country down’ Hostages’ families pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government amid new fears for the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” WATCH: Netanyahu’s Gaza takeover won’t end Hamas influence in the region, Mideast analyst says A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel’s decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel’s decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel’s plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites In the north, Israeli fire killed at least nine and wounded over 200 as people sought aid entering Gaza through the Zikim crossing, said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service in the area. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn. More deaths from hunger Gaza’s Health Ministry said the new adult deaths from malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours brought the total to 114 since it began counting such deaths in June.

The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. The White House had made a Putin meeting with Zelenskyy a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. If Zelenskyy were to travel to Alaska, it is not clear if he and Putin would ever be in the same room, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. The surge in diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine comes after Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow ahead of a deadline on Friday that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. Zelenskyy said defiantly on Saturday that Ukrainians "will not give their land to occupiers." Trump said Friday that between Russia and Ukraine, "there'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both." Administration officials were working on Saturday to try to gain support for a potential ceasefire from Ukrainian government and European leaders.

The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians have been killed seeking food since late May, when a new US and Israeli-backed organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) set up aid distribution sites. Salah has previously advocated for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza and called for "world leaders to come together to prevent further slaughter of innocent souls" amid the conflict.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

Article: The measure will cover the West, Centre and Artibonite departments, the latter of which is known as Haiti’s “rice basket” and has experienced an increase in attacks by armed groups in recent months. In a statement on Saturday, the government said the state of emergency would allow the Haitian authorities to “continue the fight against insecurity and respond to the agricultural and food crisis”. Nearly 1.3 million people have been displaced across the country, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in June, while the United Nations estimates that 4,864 people were killed from October 2024 to June of this year. While much of the focus has been on Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, where up to 90 percent of the city is under the control of armed groups, the violence has also been spreading to other parts of the country. Advertisement Between October 2024 and the end of June, more than 1,000 Haitians were killed and 620 were kidnapped in the Artibonite and Centre departments, according to the UN’s human rights office. Meanwhile, the government on Friday appointed Andre Jonas Vladimir Paraison as interim director of Haiti’s National Police, which has been working with Kenyan police officers leading the UN-backed mission to help quell the violence. “We will provide security across every corner of the country.” Paraison previously served as head of security of Haiti’s National Palace and was on duty as a police officer when Moise was killed at his private residence in July 2021. He replaced Normil Rameau, whose tenure of just more than a year was marked by tensions with a faction of the Transitional Presidential Council, notably Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The change comes as Laurent Saint-Cyr, a wealthy businessman, also took over this week as president of the Transitional Presidential Council, which is charged with holding elections by February 2026.

Vice President JD Vance and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy during a meeting at Chevening House in Kent, England, Friday, Aug. The UK meeting came as the upcoming Trump-Putin summit -- set to happen without Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the table -- has raised concern among Ukrainian officials and across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday morning he had spoken with both Zelenskyy and other European leaders and that, "The future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now." Speaking from the White House on Friday, Trump suggested discussions to end the war could include "some swapping of territories," which Zelenskyy later swiftly rejected, saying Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have also insisted that any negotiations must include Ukraine at the table. "Our positions were clear: a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognizing the occupation," Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement Saturday that also thanked JD Vance for taking part in the UK talks.

Article: The order came at the request of AG Ken Paxton, whom O’Rourke accused in a separate lawsuit of going on a "fishing expedition, constitutional rights be damned." (The Texas Tribune) Former U.S. Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton’s request for a temporary injunction, barring O’Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton’s contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either “directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators” to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for “unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators’ Constitutional duties.” O’Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O’Rourke said Paxton was trying to “make examples out of those who fight so that others won’t.” “Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, [President Donald] Trump and Abbott have on power in Texas,” O’Rourke said. With few tools to stop the map’s passage through the Republican-dominated Legislature, Democrats called on their one failsafe, leaving the state to deny quorum, or the minimum number of members required for the chamber to function. But this time, Republicans have gone on the offensive, filing lawsuits to cut off financial support; asking Illinois courts to enforce Texas’ civil warrants; investigating members and donors for bribery; and, in an unprecedented move, asking the Texas Supreme Court to expel lawmakers who left.

Article: Having finished 15 points adrift of their city rivals last season, Rangers are already a one behind Celtic before Brendan Rodgers' side play their game in hand in Aberdeen on Sunday. If Rangers get through their Euro tie after Tuesday's second leg against Plzen, they will postpone the league match against St Mirren on 24 August to prepare for the play-off tie, which means they could be seven behind by the time Celtic visit Ibrox the following week. It can be argued they were fortunate to escape Motherwell with a point last weekend, while Rangers had to play the final half hour against Dundee with 10 men before captain James Tavernier came off the bench to rescue another with his late spot kick. A "disappointed" Martin admitted: "There was just general lethargy and no speed in the first half." After last week's draw at Fir Park, Martin had questioned the mentality of some of his players, complaining that some "have to drop their ego", and was delighted with the reaction against Plzen. This time, he was "pleased with the response of the team when we went down to 10 men and we could've won the game in the end, but the mentality has to come from the very first kick of the match". Martin accepted some of the blame, admitting: "In hindsight, I should've made some changes to inject that energy in the team, but I explained my decision before the game and maybe I could've changed that now the game is finished. "We're learning about the group all the time, so that's a lesson learnt today." BBC pundit and former Rangers striker described them as "Jekyll and Hyde" but pointed out that the same happened under the previous two team bosses - Philippe Clement and Barry Ferguson - last season.

WATCH: ‘The Devil Reached Toward the Sky’ documents motivation and development of the atomic bomb About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn’t distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” READ MORE: At 80th anniversary of Hiroshima bombing, survivors fear lessons may be forgotten as nuclear threat rises In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba’s speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

He makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer. At first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find – less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour. Reuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth Sotheby's strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa). An Italian academic article published last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Niger's Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by "a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed". Meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. According to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was "sold by the local community to an international dealer" and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo. "As with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved." A spokesperson added that Sotheby's was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and "we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised". The academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the country's vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Niger's cultural and natural heritage – including anything that has fallen from outer space - returned. But, according to a 2019 study by international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. AFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks Morocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites - more than 1,000 - found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara. More than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a "Saharan gold rush", fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours. It's a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but it's the same state in all our countries." Prof Sereno hopes that the Sotheby's sale will prove a turning-point - firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly "if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it".

Article: What it means to be 'culturally' Irish in 2025 is complicated - as Ed Sheeran has shown 38 minutes ago Share Save Fergal Keane • @fergalkeane47 Special correspondent Share Save BBC He sang wistfully of the English town that shaped his life. But I can't wait to go home." Ed Sheeran grew up in Framlingham in Suffolk and its rolling hills and magnificent castle inspired his hit single, Castle on the Hill. "I can be allowed to feel a connection to a place half my family is from." Yet he was accused of being Irish "when it suits him" by one poster. Another wrote on X: "I've seen B*Witched live and have watched a couple of Gaelic football games, which I think gives me an even more legitimate claim to be culturally Irish than Ed Sheeran." Getty Images Ed Sheeran said: 'I class my culture as Irish. "That doesn't mean to say he doesn't like or love being British, that is part of him too." Certainly it is much easier to speak of an Irish identity in Britain now that there is peace in Northern Ireland. As the Belfast South MP, Claire Hanna, who is now leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told parliament during a St Patrick's Day debate in 2022: "Many are moving on from the traditional binaries of the past and embracing the 'or both' part of the Good Friday agreement, not feeling that they have to decide between being British and Irish if they do not wish to do so." Sheeran's declaration raises this point once again, and prompts the deeper question of what cultural "Irishness" really is today. Identity versus citizenship Professor Linda Connolly, director of sociology at Maynooth University in County Kildare, argues that Ed Sheeran's statement is about an idea of identity that is bigger than where you were born or what you write on a census form. I am also a Cork, Kerry and Waterford person' (County Cork pictured) For many unionists, staunch political loyalty to Britain and the Monarchy, sits alongside a deep attachment to the land they have lived on for hundreds of years. There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup. Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles Everyone has their own menu of what being "culturally Irish" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously. It runs a wide spectrum of styles, influences, opinions and genres - from Oasis (born in Manchester to Irish parents), the rappers Kneecap, novelist Sally Rooney, the Irish actress of Nigerian descent Demi Isaac Oviawe, the London-born playwright Martin McDonagh of The Banshees of Inisherin fame. Getty Images Noel and Liam Gallagher were born in Manchester to Irish parents The core members of The Beatles all had Irish grandparents or great grandparents, prompting John Lennon to tell a concert in Dublin: "We're all Irish." That was in 1963 – some 62 years before Ed Sheeran's declaration. There are many voices too from the Irish Protestant tradition in Ulster – the singer Van Morrison and the novelist Jan Carson, who has written about growing up in an evangelical Christian home, and says she now feels "much more ease and comfort with an Irish identity than a British one". Getty Images Culturally Irish can mean a sense of a particular landscape - like the world of "the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting," evoked by Shane McGowan of the Pogues. Today, it is undoubtedly easier these days for a big mainstream star like Sheeran to embrace an Irish cultural identity in Britain than it would have been several decades ago. I think of the powerful song Nothing But the Same Old Story by Paul Brady, about an Irishman in Britain during the 1970s, amid the ongoing IRA campaign: "In their eyes, we're nothing but a bunch of murderers." Cross-fertilisation of cultures Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including legendary BBC presenter Terry Wogan and musicians such as U2, Thin Lizzy, Sinead O'Connor, the Pogues "and now Ed Sheeran!" Yet all of these icons are building on the foundations laid by the unacknowledged millions who came to Britain over many centuries. In those days, most Irish immigrants found expression of their culture in the ballrooms of places like Kilburn in northwest London, or the Astoria in Manchester, or the Irish pubs which often catered to clientele from a specific county. For two millennia there are records of the Irish trading, settling, and inter-marrying in Britain; they shared a common language with western Scotland and the Isle of Man, and a Druidic culture with the rest of Britain. Getty Images Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including the late Sinead O'Connor One of the bestselling songwriters of early 19th century Britain was Irishman Thomas Moore. His story typifies the often complex nature of cultural relationships: he was a champion of Irish liberty, but his great song "The Minstrel Boy" – written for rebels fighting Britain – is played by the band of the Irish Guards at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day. "The physical distance between Ireland and Britain has diminished in the Ryanair era… It seems to me also that Irish migration to Britain is now more likely to be temporary - people may come for a few years, then go home - whereas previously it was a more permanent departure." 'I'm an Irishman, and a Londoner - and much else too' I should declare an interest. Fergal Keane today, alongside a photo of him as an aspiring young folk singer back in Limerick in the 1980s The Irish language and music is an essential part of my cultural makeup. But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: "And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here." My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. 'The old battle of identities is far from finished' The nature of identity is evolving - in Ireland it is absorbing the influences of other cultures, but also influencing those cultures. Professor Nic Dháibhéid hopes the prominence of Irish cultural identities in Britain will prompt a greater interest in the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly among the under-25s who, as she sees it, "will have no memory of the Troubles, and so there is an even greater need to ensure that there is good mutual understanding between the people on our two islands." The big British audiences for Kneecap, to take an example, didn't happen because young people had a sudden awakening about the problems of life in nationalist west Belfast. Press Association The Derry Girls phenomenon is real, says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city It is important to recognise that the cultural influence can be polarising. One member of the band, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. "The Kneecap phenomenon is real, as is the Derry Girls one," says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, also referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city in the 1990s. I watch them navigate the challenges and opportunities of different and overlapping identities, encouraging them to follow James Joyce's advice and fly past any barriers others put in their way.

Article: "These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties," Serena says, "but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it." Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. "If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round." But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The "functional beverage" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could "prevent, treat or cure disease" were a step too far. Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. "In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks." Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. "I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option." Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, "crack on", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a "therapy session or a massage at the end of the month". "I'm ADHD," Emily says, "so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down." TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said

Article: 41 minutes ago Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save Universal Pictures/Prime Video The whole film shows either Ice Cube's computer screen or his face as seen on the monitor's camera Film critics have delivered a verdict: the new version of War of the Worlds – which stars Ice Cube as a man who must save humanity from an alien invasion without leaving his desk – is bad. 'Verges on parody' Lon Harris, executive producer of the This Week in Startups podcast, stoked the conversation this week when he posted: "Dipping below like 5% on Rotten Tomatoes has basically the same appeal to me as breaking 90%. "I watch a lot of movies, there's so much content coming out, and most of it is bland and forgettable." Harris was intrigued enough to watch War of the Worlds, and it duly lived down to his expectations. "It's very silly, Ice Cube's solo performance just reacting to things on his laptop screen verges at times on parody and frequently made me laugh, and there's a whole subplot involving Amazon drone deliveries that's so on-the-nose it's almost unbelievable that they included it," he says. "That's more interesting than just 'another alien invasion movie' to me." After its initial battering, one critic has now taken pity on War of the Worlds, having enjoyed watching it. It's certainly stupid, but it's also a great deal of fun." That write-up, which concluded that the "movie is a mess, but an uproarious one", was deemed positive by Rotten Tomatoes so has nudged the film's Tomatometer score up from 0% to the giddy heights of 4% at the time of writing. Getty Images Samurai Cop is famously bad but built up such a fanbase that it got a sequel 24 years later Truly atrocious movies are preferable to those that are simply forgettable, according to Timon Singh, who set up the Bristol Bad Film Club a decade ago. "In comparison, Samurai Cop is technically a terrible film, but it's 90 minutes of pure enjoyable terrible acting, awful fight scenes, and once you've seen it, you're never going to forget it. "Whereas you'll probably forget Transformers: The Last Knight while you're watching it." Getty Images Tommy Wiseau wrote, directed and starred in The Room, which still gets regular screenings Other films to have gained cult followings include 2003's The Room , described as "a trash masterpiece", in the Daily Beast. Katharine Coldiron, author of Junk Film: Why Bad Movies Matter, says it's better to watch a film-maker like Wiseau try hard and fall short, rather than someone going through the motions. One Missed Call (2008) A ridiculous (but competent) remake of a Japanese horror film about teenage friends who get voicemail messages sent by their future selves at their moments of death.

Those claims – and the app's sudden surge in popularity – wiped $600bn (£446bn) or 17% off the market value of chip giant Nvidia, marking the largest one-day loss for a single stock in the history of the US stock market. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen referred to the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment," a reference to the Soviet satellite that had kicked off the space race between the US and the USSR more than a half century earlier. Bloomberg via Getty Images Shares of Japanese semiconductor-related companies extended a late January drop after the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek prompted a selloff in US tech stocks Still relevant It has now been six months since DeepSeek stunned the world. Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that "with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model". When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based. In online forums, users explain how to run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China - a workaround they believe can protect their data from being shared surreptitiously. "China was seen as playing catch-up in large language models until this point, with competitive models but always trailing the best western ones," policy analyst Wendy Chang of the Mercator Institute for China Studies told the BBC.

Richard Lynn said that on 18 March 2024, he paid £1.70 to park for about 30 minutes in Rushton's Yard car park in Ashby, Leicestershire, but later received a demand for £165 from solicitors representing private firm Horizon Parking. The 53-year-old said photographic evidence, provided by the company, showed his Hyundai entering the car park - but a Kia with an identical number plate bar one letter leaving nine hours later. Supplied Horizon Parking provided photos showing Mr Lynn's car (left) with its number plate starting FH6 - and another car with an FP6 registration Reflecting on the situation, Mr Lynn said: "It's ridiculous. "The result of this is that I received a pretty nasty letter, threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay a fine I should not have been issued with in the first place." On 25 March 2024, Mr Lynn was sent a letter demanding £85 - £51 if he paid within 14 days. However, he said he only became aware of the matter in July this year - when he received a letter from solicitors acting on behalf of Horizon Parking demanding £165. Mr Lynn said he moved house in December 2022 but said he had, in error, not notified the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) of his change of address until some time in "early 2024". Horizon Parking said it originally wrote to Mr Lynn, to the address provided by the DVLA, on 25 March 2024, then sent reminder letters on 24 April and 24 May last year. "I'm pretty angry about the whole thing."

Article: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposts video of pastors saying women shouldn't vote toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reposted and praised a video interview of a self-described Christian nationalist pastor whose church doesn't believe women shouldn't be allowed to vote. Doug Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, said during the interview with CNN that, "Women are the kind of people that people come out of." "The wife and mother, who is the chief executive of the home, is entrusted with three or four or five eternal souls," he continued. In his repost of the interview on the platform X, Hegseth added, "All of Christ for All of Life." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told NPR in an emailed statement on Saturday that Hegseth is a "proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches," which was founded by Wilson. In the CNN video, a congregant in Wilson's church explained that her husband "is the head of our household and I do submit to him." A fellow pastor also said that families should vote as a household, with the husband and father casting the vote. Andrew Whitehead, a sociology professor at Indiana University Indianapolis and an expert on Christian nationalism, told NPR the goal for Wilson and his followers is to spread these ideas across the country – and ultimately make them enforceable. "It really does matter if the Secretary of Defense is retweeting a video with very particular views about whether women should be able to vote or serve in combat roles or if slavery really isn't all that bad," Whitehead said.

Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior FBI official who served as acting director in the first weeks of the Trump administration and resisted demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in the Jan. The circumstances of Brian Driscoll’s ouster were not immediately clear, but his final day is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The news comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of current director FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked international counterterrorism investigations in New York and had also commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys manpower and resources to crisis situations. Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination.” Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about President Donald Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

Article: British police said they arrested more than 200 people in central London as supporters of a recently banned pro-Palestinian group intentionally flouted the law as part of their effort to force the government to reconsider the ban Police officers arrest a demonstrator during a protest in support of the Palestinian People in Gaza, in Parliament Square, in London, Saturday, Aug. 9, 2025.(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali) LONDON -- British police said they arrested more than 200 people in central London on Saturday as supporters of a recently banned pro-Palestinian group intentionally flouted the law as part of their effort to force the government to reconsider the ban. That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AKP via AP) BANGKOK -- Three Thai soldiers on patrol were wounded Saturday when one stepped on a land mine in territory along the border with Cambodia, Thailand’s army announced. The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side.” The Ottawa Convention, also called the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, is an international agreement banning the weapons’ use, and both Thailand and Cambodia have committed to it. A statement from Thailand’s foreign ministry said the incident confirmed the Thai army’s findings “that new land mines are being laid in blatant violation of international law.” It also noted this was the third such incident in less than a month. Winthai Suvaree, charged that Saturday’s mine explosion constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems.” A statement issued in response by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied Thailand’s allegation that Cambodia had laid new mines. “We have not, and will not, plant new land mines,” said the statement, noting that Cambodia is a party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty Convention, “and has an internationally recognized record of removing, not deploying, these indiscriminate weapons." It noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970.

(AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph) SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Haiti’s government announced Saturday that it is implementing a three-month state of emergency in the country’s central region as gang violence surges. The United Nations’ human rights office noted that from October 2024 to the end of June 2025, more than 1,000 people have been killed, more than 200 injured and 620 kidnapped in the Artibonite and Central departments and nearby areas. On Friday, the government appointed a new interim director general to oversee Haiti’s National Police, which is working with Kenyan police officers leading a U.N.-backed mission to help quell gang violence. André Jonas Vladimir Paraison replaces former police director general Normil Rameau, who was criticized for his struggle to contain violence perpetrated by gangs that control up to 90% of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince. Paraison previously served as head of security of Haiti’s National Palace, and he was on duty as a police officer when former President Jovenel Moïse was killed at his private residence in July 2021.

Aude prefect Christian Pouget said the fire has been contained since Thursday after burning this week more than 160 square kilometers (62 square miles) in the wooded region, known for its wineries. France’s national weather agency Meteo France placed the southern half of France under “high vigilance” alert for heat wave, with temperatures expected in the Aude region of up to 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday.

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File) LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate Thursday by a quarter percentage point to 4%, as policy makers seek to bolster the sluggish U.K. “There will be hopes that if loans become cheaper, it will help boost consumer and business confidence but there’s a long way to go,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said before the decision. “In the meantime, speculation over potential tax rises in the Autumn Budget may keep households and companies cautious, given the uncertainty over where extra burdens may land.” Policymakers decided to cut rates even though consumer prices rose 3.6% in the 12 months through June, significantly above the bank’s 2% target. Britain’s unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in the three months through May, the highest level in four years, signaling that previous tax increases and uncertainty about the global economy are weighing on employers.

Article: Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades Crown-of-thorns starfish are seen at Tern Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef in far North Queensland, Australia, on Jan. (Australian Institute of Marine Science via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say. But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths — caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change — have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday. The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world’s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said. Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest — and fourth ever recorded — mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world’s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. Coral reefs are considered a “unique and threatened system” due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. That report said “tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.” The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s “suggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.” “Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.

The blaze, which started Tuesday and tore through the Corbières massif in the Aude region, has remained uncontained despite the deployment of over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft. “It’s very sad to think about the image we’re going to give of our Corbières region, with its devastated landscapes and desperate women and men, not just today or tomorrow, but for weeks and months to come. “It is a fire that is clearly a consequence of climate change and drought in this region.” This week’s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.

Article: Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir, accusing them of promoting a "false narrative" and "secessionism." SRINAGAR, India -- Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir that they say propagate “false narratives” and “secessionism” in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019. It said such books played “a critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.” The action was taken following “investigations and credible intelligence” about “systemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature” that was “often disguised as historical or political commentary,” it said. A year earlier to that, police arrested a college lecturer on charges he gave his students an English exam filled with questions attacking a crackdown on demonstrations challenging Indian rule in the region. “It only exposes the insecurities and limited understanding of those behind such authoritarian actions, and the contradiction in proudly hosting the ongoing Book Festival.” Banning books is not common in India, but authorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have increasingly raided independent media houses, jailed journalists and sought to re-write history in school and university textbooks to promote the Hindu nationalist vision of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. The Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. “We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the Democrats “un-Texan.” “Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said. Hours after Monday's halted House session, a gaggle of Democrats — state lawmakers who left and members of Congress whose lines would be redrawn — mocked Abbott as the weak figure in this battle. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

(AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions.

In a 2023 case from Alabama, the high court said the congressional districts drawn by the state's Republican-led Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting strength of Black residents.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

While bashing Kentucky's longest-serving senator at a GOP dinner on the eve of Saturday's Fancy Farm picnic, a tradition-laden stop on the state's political circuit, Morris was cut off in midsentence by a party activist in the crowd, who noted that McConnell isn't seeking reelection and pointedly asked Morris: “What are you running on?” Morris touted his hard line stance on immigration and defended Trump's tariffs as a boon for American manufacturing. “Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell told a Republican crowd that included Morris at a pre-picnic breakfast in Mayfield. McConnell endorsed Trump in 2024, but in a biography by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, released shortly before the election, McConnell described him as “a despicable human being.” Morris, who started a waste management technology company, says the senator has been insufficiently loyal to Trump and allowed festering issues like immigration and the national debt to grow worse during his years in Senate leadership. "It seems, to me, maybe just maybe, Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago." McConnell had his customary front-row seat for much of the event but wasn't there for Morris' remarks.

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) Former President Bill Clinton plans big changes for this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting “by necessity” to address the changing landscape for global development and increasing needs driven by war and climate disasters. “We need to redefine how we show up, how we work, and how we find ways to honor our common humanity,” Clinton wrote in a letter to the CGI community released Thursday. “This September, our goal will be to connect dots across issues, expose the consequences, and confront the complicated issues in front of us.” Since its launch in 2005, the CGI annual meeting has served as a platform for political, business and philanthropic leaders to announce new initiatives or new financial support for existing programs addressing the world’s problems. At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women’s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better. This year’s meeting — held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton — will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. “This year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.” In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI hopes to close those gaps with a series of “Leaders Stage Sessions,” where representatives from a wide range of organizations – including GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan, Center for Disaster Philanthropy CEO Patricia McIlreavy, AFL-CIO President, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten -- will work together to create new initiatives. “Now is the time to stand up and roll up our sleeves — and do our part to reverse the trend lines and begin charting a brighter future,” Clinton said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

Claudio Lavenia | Getty Images "Loud luxury" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out "quiet luxury" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. "We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment," Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last month. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus." The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piano have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags. "There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance," Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email. Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench. Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was "reigniting brand desire" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as "a luxury brand with broad universal appeal."

Wwd | Getty Images Gucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label. Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a "first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. "Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again." New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Venetta and the famously out-there Versace. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time," group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month. The big divide Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand.

Article: — Stetson Bennett passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns in a strong start to the preseason, leading the Los Angeles Rams to a 31-21 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday night in new Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer's debut. Blake Corum rushed for short TDs to cap the Rams' first two offensive drives behind Bennett, the two-time national champion at the University of Georgia attempting to secure his job as the Rams' third-string quarterback for another season. Looking much sharper than he did a year ago against the Cowboys, Bennett went 16 for 24 and hit Cody Schrader and Brennan Presley for touchdowns in the second half. Joe Milton passed for 143 yards before injuring his elbow in the fourth quarter of a solid debut with the Cowboys, throwing a touchdown pass to Rivaldo Fairweather with 8:48 to play. The Rams didn't even play second-string quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo — but Matthew Stafford, who didn't participate in training camp due to a back injury, went through a lengthy workout before the game ahead of his anticipated return to practice Monday. Schotty starts The game was the head coaching debut for the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant coach with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Although he has no intention of showing much of his offensive tendencies in the preseason to start his first year as Dallas' play-caller, Schottenheimer got right to work in the other privileges of his new job: He unsuccessfully challenged a sideline catch by the Rams' Xavier Smith on a 39-yard pass from Bennett on the game's opening drive. Offensive interference Lamb didn’t stay out of the action entirely despite being in street clothes: He got a penalty in the second quarter when an official ran into him as he strayed into the white paint on the sideline.

Article: WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country's safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. A crackdown came after an assault The catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.

Article: A gunman opened fire in Atlanta on Friday afternoon near the campuses of both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University, killing a police officer who was responding to calls of an active shooter, officials said. “Officer Rose’s passing is a stark reminder that every day, law enforcement officers put themselves in harm’s way to protect others, and this dedication deserves our respect and gratitude.” CDC building struck CDC Director Susan Monarez said four of the campus’ buildings were hit during the shooting. Monarez said Friday that she was “heartbroken by today’s attack.” In a letter to employees on Saturday, Monarez said that “Monday will be a remote workday for all employees in order for us to conduct a security assessment before returning to the office.” “Law enforcement is still assessing damage to CDC buildings, but it is a relief to report that no CDC employees or visitors were harmed, and we are grateful for the swift response of CDC Security and local law enforcement,” she said. Asked if it was believed that the shooter targeted the CDC, Dickens said Friday the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that he could not say more about a possible motive. He referred to the suspect as “a known person that may have some interests in certain things, that I can’t reiterate right know with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.” A neighbor of the suspect, who said she knew him very well and requested anonymity, told NBC News that White had expressed anti-vaccine sentiments to her on multiple occasions. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., offered prayers and said he was "devastated that our community is facing yet another tragedy of gun violence." FBI Director Kash Patel said the agency would offer full support to Georgia officials in the wake of the shooting. Second shooting in Georgia in one week Friday’s shooting comes two days after an active-duty solider wounded five service members at Fort Stewart before a group of witnesses subdued him, officials said. Three of the five who were injured have been released from the hospital, which Lubas said Thursday was “amazing considering the circumstances and the ranges of which they were engaged.” The two who remain hospitalized are expected to recover, Lubas said.

Homegrown efforts to redo lawns so they need less water also haven’t gone over well—even when local governments encourage it: A Long Island village recently tried to sue one of its residents for $2,000 after she used her town’s $350 native plants grant to re-wild her yard, which the village mayor called “hideous.” (They compromised with a 4-foot cap on the garden’s height.)

"The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine," said a joint statement issued by the leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland and the European Commission. Late on Saturday, a White House official said that Trump would be willing to hold a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky - but for now, it remains just the two of them, as initially requested by the Russian leader. Trump has previously suggested that he could start by meeting only with Putin, telling reporters he planned to "start off with Russia." But the US president also said that he believed "we have a shot at" organising a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky. Whether Putin would agree to this is unclear - he has refused several opportunities to hold direct talks, and the two leaders have not met face-to-face since Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago. Speaking on Friday, Trump also suggested that there "will be some swapping of territories" in order for Moscow and Kyiv to reach an agreement - to which Zelensky reacted strongly. still impose the idea of 'exchanging' Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing but more convenient positions for the Russians to resume the war," he added defiantly.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Sponsor Message CDC shooter identified The Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter, but authorities haven't said whether he was killed by police or killed himself. "This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia." Kennedy reaches out to staff "We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose," Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." toggle caption Mike Stewart/AP Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a "Dear colleagues" email, and called for his resignation.

Opponents say officials' rhetoric contributed Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. "When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains." A request for comment from Vought's agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the "physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers," said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. Sponsor Message Nancy Hoalst, who lives on the same street as White's family, said he seemed like a "good guy" while doing yard work and walking dogs for neighbors, but he would bring up vaccines even in unrelated conversations. "He emphatically believed that." But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: "I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC."

Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to "the misinformation, the disinformation" that "caused this issue."

When overall growth falls that sharply, the labor market tends to follow, which is precisely what happened: Job growth, at 35,000 per month on average between May and July, is dangerously close to stall speed. In the ’70s, stagflation was caused not by an unconstrained president but by “exogenous shocks,” meaning big, unexpected disruptions originating from events outside the country and exacerbated by the inaction of the Federal Reserve to offset them.

Republicans are more complimentary of their party, although a small but significant share describe the GOP as “greedy” or say it is generally "bad." The poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July reveals warning signs for both major U.S. adults held a dim view of both parties, with about 4 in 10 using negative attributes, including words such as “dishonest” or “stupid." But nearly nine months after Republican Donald Trump won a second presidential term, Democrats appear to be harboring more resentment about the state of their party than do Republicans. About 15% described it using words like “weak," or “apathetic,” while an additional 10% believe it is broadly “ineffective” or "disorganized.” Only about 2 in 10 Democrats described their party positively, with roughly 1 in 10 saying it is “empathetic,” or “inclusive.” An additional 1 in 10 used more general positive descriptors. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to describe their party positively, with many also using straightforward ideological descriptors like “conservative.” About 4 in 10 Republicans used positive attributes to characterize the GOP, making general mentions of words such as “patriotic” or “hardworking,” or offering associations with the word “freedom.” Samuel Washington, 65, of Chicago, said he typically votes Republican.

Article: Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine near the Cambodian border on Saturday, the Thai army said, days after the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire halting last month's deadly five-day conflict. One soldier lost a foot and two were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine while patrolling an area between Thailand's Sisaket and Cambodia's Preah Vihear provinces, the army said in a statement. The foreign ministry said Bangkok would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty, to which both are signatories, that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty. The country is a "proud state party" to the Ottawa Convention against landmines and has cleared more than 1 million mines left from decades of war, the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that Thailand's accusations risked undermining the spirit of the ceasefire. Bangkok and Phnom Penh have quarrelled for decades over undemarcated parts of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was its colony. The July 24-28 clashes, the worst fighting between the countries in more than a decade, involved exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties that killed at least 43 and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides. The fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to let observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
