Article: As war rages, she is living among the ruins of the Islamic University, a once-bustling educational institution that, like most others in Gaza, has become a shelter for displaced people. Ali is part of a generation of Palestinians in Gaza – from primary school through university students – who say they have been robbed of an education by nearly two years of Israeli air strikes that have destroyed the enclave’s institutions. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, according to the latest satellite-based damage assessment in July, 97 percent of educational facilities in Gaza have sustained some level of damage with 91 percent requiring major rehabilitation or complete reconstruction to become functional again. Israel plans a new Gaza offensive, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he expected to complete “fairly quickly”, as the UN Security Council heard new demands for an end to the suffering in the Palestinian enclave. Saja Adwan, 19, an honours student at the al-Azhar Institute who is living in a school turned shelter with her family of nine, recalled how the building where she once learned was bombed.

Article: In that scenario, a separate inflation measure preferred by the Federal Reserve would rise to 3.2% in December, well ahead of the central bank’s official 2% target, the analysts said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that if it weren’t for Trump’s tariffs, the Fed would have lowered interest rates by now in order to make borrowing in the economy cheaper and thus help boost employment. In remarks delivered Saturday, Michele Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said any inflationary impact from tariffs should be considered a “one-off,” and that excluding those effects reveals a pace of price growth that is much more subdued. “Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.” Some economists estimate it could take as long as 18 months for the tariffs’ impact to fully make their way through the economy. While inflation-adjusted weekly earnings ticked up last quarter, approximately 43% of workers saw their paychecks grow less than the cost of living as of June according to Indeed, with most concentrated at the low-to-middle end of the pay spectrum, according to Indeed. A separate measure of current and future family financial situations tracked by the Conference Board research and consulting group deteriorated in July, with the share of consumers expecting a recession over the next 12 months still above the levels seen in 2024. Walmart said “pricing fluctuations are a normal course of business and are influenced by a variety of factors.” Earlier this year, a Walmart executive was more direct about the impact tariffs were having.

Article: In a statement, European leaders said "the people of Ukraine must have the freedom to decide their future." European leaders have warned against Ukrainian borders being redrawn by force – two days before a US-Russia summit on Ukraine is due to take place in Alaska. The statement underscored the nervousness felt by Europeans about Moscow's actions in Ukraine, which many countries – particularly those bordering Russia or those in which the memory of Soviet occupation still lingers – believe could pose a direct threat in the near future. US President Donald Trump has insisted that any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" and could see Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and keeping Crimea. In their statement, European leaders said "Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has wider implications for European and international security", and stressed the need for a "just and lasting peace". In a post on social media its leader Victor Orban said he had opted out of supporting the statement as it attempted to set conditions for a meeting to which the EU was not invited and warned leaders not to start "providing instructions from the bench". He also urged the EU to set up its own summit with Russia – though EU leaders have been shunning direct talks with Moscow since it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They will be hoping to put the security of the European continent and Ukrainian interests at the forefront of his mind – at a time when nervousness is growing that the peace imposed on Ukraine may end up being neither "just" nor "lasting".

Article: Small boat crossings to hit 50,000 since Labour came to power 19 minutes ago Share Save Simon Jones & Ian Aikman BBC News Share Save Getty Images The number of migrants to cross the English Channel in small boats since Labour came to power last summer is expected to have reached 50,000. Government minister Baroness Jacqui Smith told the BBC this was an "unacceptable number of people" but pointed to the "one in, one out" returns deal with France as a deterrent. The latest figures come as ministers continue to grapple with how to effectively crack down on people-smuggling gangs - a key pledge of Sir Keir Starmer's when he became prime minister. Baroness Smith told BBC Breakfast: "We understand how concerning this is to people." She said the migrant crossing figures showed people-smuggling gangs had taken an "absolute foothold in the tragic trafficking of people" in recent years. The "one in, one out" pilot will see the UK return some migrants to France in exchange for receiving the same number of asylum seekers who are believed to have legitimate claims.

Article: With hours left on the clock before the looming midnight Tuesday deadline, Trump's executive order acknowledged that China was taking "significant steps" toward addressing American concerns on "economic and national security matters." Beijing announced the truce extension at the same time. Sponsor Message The extension gives the two sides a further 90 days to iron out their differences on a range of issues as Trump seeks to reshape the global economy in favor of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. announces several trade agreements with countries including South Korea and Japan on the one hand, while it levies steep tariffs on several nations on the other — for example, Trump has threatened to raise U.S. "Today's news all-round stabilizes the situation, increases confidence for American consumers, for importers of goods who sell those goods in the U.S., and for manufacturers in China," said David Meale, the head of Eurasia Group's China Division and a former diplomat and deputy chief of mission for the U.S. and China will come to some kind of trade arrangement, and the next steps are likely to be driven by the prospect of a leaders' meeting between President Trump and President Xi later this fall." Meale says he thinks the next steps for both sides will involve more meetings between trade and economic officials like the ones held in Stockholm last month, to lay the groundwork for an eventual face-to-face meeting and a more concrete trade agreement which could be signed before the latest truce expires on Nov. At a meeting in Geneva in May, however, tensions cooled when the two sides announced a 90-day truce , with both countries lowering tariff rates and easing other trade barriers including deliveries of Chinese rare earth minerals. and China have been complex and included several issues, ranging from American concerns about Chinese overproduction and purchases of Russian oil to Chinese complaints about Washington's decision to limit exports of semiconductors that China needs to power AI systems. Meale says the American priority for these negotiations will be to lower its trade deficit with China, to secure and diversify its supply chains away from reliance on China and to make sure the flow of rare earth minerals from China will be stable. Sponsor Message China, Meale says, is "looking for stability" in its relationship with the U.S., as it faces a slower-growing economy and seeks a more predictable environment for its businesses. Nicholas Lardy, a nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, also says a final U.S.-China trade deal may include easing of technology restrictions, and a less likely possibility might be Chinese promises to invest in U.S.

Article: Now, Presidents Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin will hold a summit Friday in Alaska to discuss another difficult and costly Russian war involving Crimea, one of the territories Russia has captured in its fight with Ukraine. Some Russians, including Kremlin envoy Kirill Dimitriev, are pointing to that period on social media, posting photos of Russian Orthodox Churches, with their onion domes, that were built in Alaska in the 19th-century and still stand. Sponsor Message "Some Americans might know that we bought Alaska from Russia, but they don't know necessarily that it was a real colony there," said Lee Farrow, a history professor at Auburn University at Montgomery and author of Seward's Folly: A New Look at the Alaska Purchase. They had a strong presence in California as well." Farrow was referring to Fort Ross, an outpost the Russians established in what's now part of Sonoma County in northern California. Sold for a pittance Russia's decision to sell Alaska was motivated by its need to pay off war debts accumulated during the 1853-56 Crimean War, which Russia lost to the combined forces of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. By this time, Russian hunters in Alaska had killed off most of the accessible bears, wolves, otters and other animals with valuable furs and pelts, and therefore the Russians saw little economic reason to stay. "There has been a very strong narrative in Russia that we either did not pay for it or it was a lease, and we should have returned it already." The Crimea link While Alaska changed hands peacefully, Crimea is a territory that's often been in conflict due to its strategic location as a peninsula jutting into the Black Sea.

Article: The Trump administration is evaluating plans that would establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of hundreds of National Guard troops tasked with rapidly deploying into American cities facing protests or other unrest, according to internal Pentagon documents reviewed by The Washington Post. They would be split into two groups of 300 and stationed at military bases in Alabama and Arizona, with purview of regions east and west of the Mississippi River, respectively. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Cost projections outlined in the documents indicate that such a mission, if the proposal is adopted, could stretch into the hundreds of millions dollars should military aircraft and aircrews also be required to be ready around-the-clock. Fiscal year 2027 is the earliest this program could be created and funded through the Pentagon’s traditional budgetary process, the documents say, leaving unclear whether the initiative could begin sooner through an alternative funding source. Advertisement While most National Guard commands have fast-response teams for use within their home states, the proposal under evaluation by the Trump administration would entail moving troops from one state to another. Advertisement Advertisement The National Guard tested the concept ahead of the 2020 election, putting 600 troops on alert in Arizona and Alabama as the country braced for possible political violence. police shows such incidents are in decline; the city’s mayor called the move “unsettling and unprecedented.” Earlier this year, over the objections of California’s governor and other Democrats, Trump dispatched more than 5,000 National Guard members and active-duty Marines to the Los Angeles area under a rarely used authority permitting the military’s use for quelling insurrection. The Trump administration is relying on a shaky legal theory that the president can act broadly to protect federal property and functions said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice who specializes in legal issues germane to the U.S. “You don’t want to normalize routine domestic deployment.” Advertisement The strategy is further complicated by the fact that National Guard members from one state cannot operate in another state without permission, Nunn said. “It actually makes it more likely that you’re going to see domestic deployments — because why else have a task force?” The proposal represents a major departure in how the National Guard traditionally has been used, said Lindsay P. While it is not unusual for National Guard units to be deployed for domestic emergencies within their states, including for civil disturbances, this “is really strange because essentially nothing is happening,” she said. “There is a well-established procedure that exists to request additional assistance during times of need,” Carter said, “and the Trump administration is blatantly and dangerously ignoring that precedent.” Advertisement Advertisement One action memo contained in the documents, dated July 22, recommends that Army military police and Air Force security forces receive additional training for the mission. The first 100 would be ready to move within an hour, with the second and third waves ready to move within two and 12 hours notice, the documents note, or all immediately deployed when placed on high alert. Advertisement The quick-reaction teams would be on task for 90 days, the documents said, “to limit burnout.” The documents also show robust internal discussions that, with unusual candor, detail the possible negative repercussions if the plan were enacted. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The documents highlight several other concerns, including: • Reduced Availability for Other Missions: State-Level Readiness: States may have fewer Guard members available for local emergencies (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes). • Strain on Personnel and Equipment: Frequent domestic deployments can lead to personnel fatigue (stress, burnout, employer conflicts) and accelerated wear and tear on equipment, particularly systems not designed for prolonged civil support missions. • Training Disruptions: Erosion of Core Capabilities: Extensive domestic deployments can disrupt scheduled training, hinder skill maintenance and divert units from their primary military mission sets, ultimately impacting overall combat readiness. • Public and Political Impact: National Guard support for DHS raises potential political sensitivities, questions regarding the appropriate civil-military balance and legal considerations related to their role as a nonpartisan force. — National Guard planning documents reviewed by The Post Officials also have expressed some worry that deploying troops too quickly could make for a haphazard situation as state and local governments scramble to coordinate their arrival, the documents show.

Article: Flush with cash from a period of resilient earnings, a growing number of European companies are shunning high-stakes deals in favor of smaller and targeted "bolt-on" acquisitions to pursue growth. "This is a time again as part of playing offense, where we're definitely considering what M & A might be on the table," Hanneke Faber, CEO of Swiss-American hardware maker Logitech , told CNBC's " Squawk Box Europe " after announcing its first-quarter results. Sawan said those are the type of deals that can help Shell "grow without having to do a big splash." Sawan is not alone in rethinking large-scale M & As. "Given the situation on golden power, there was no other place to go, and at some point, you need to catch your losses, eliminate your drag, and focus on what you control," Orcel told CNBC, referring to the Italian government's power to block deals in strategic sectors. "We are much more into being very selective, very value accretive in terms of how this complements country by country, our portfolio of customers and technologies." The company announced that three such deals made in Canada, Peru and Italy were closed in a single week in July, on top of larger acquisitions in Australia and Latin America. "This is really part of the strategy of Givaudan, which is around the bolt-on acquisitions, to buy small competitors, which give us a very nice and interesting portfolio of clients that we don't necessarily have, and the two, combined with Givaudan, is a great way to grow," said CEO Gilles Andrier. Dutch grocer Ahold Delhaize , which has been the subject of rumors about a potential mega-merger with France's Carrefour in late 2024, pointed instead to its recent 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) acquisition of Romanian supermarket chain Profi as proof of its active M & A strategy. "We also look at other opportunities to grow the company inorganically through M & A, and that's why we are always looking at what we can do in Europe and the US," said chief executive Frans Muller. We have a strong balance sheet where we have the strength to do these kinds of things." "We're actively looking and where things fit our strategy agenda and fit also, let's say, the right economic values, we are open to these kinds of things," Muller added. Executives are also keenly aware of the operational burdens that M & As can create in integrating the acquired business into their own firms, highlighting the attractiveness of smaller deals. So we are, at the moment, very cautious in looking at future acquisitions." — CNBC's Juliana Tatelbaum, Karen Tso, Steve Sedgwick, Silvia Amaro, Annette Weisbach, and Carolin Roth contributed reporting.

If Trump’s gambit succeeds — and right now it looks as if it will — then California and other states that could counter the premature Texas redistricting have only one choice — to respond in kind. California Newsom warns Trump in heated letter he’s ‘playing with fire’ on redistricting ‘If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states,’ Newsom wrote to Trump. Advertisement Voices Contributor: Newsom’s cynical redistricting ploy should be rejected by voters Newsom, California Democrats and their attempt to wrest power from the state’s independent redistricting system are no better — and maybe worse — than Abbott and the Texas Republicans. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who represented New York for nearly a quarter century, warned decades ago about the tendency to “ define deviancy down ” and normalize actions that are anything but normal. Gavin Newsom succinctly put it: “California’s moral high ground means nothing if we’re powerless because of it.” Politics Newsom welcomes Texas Democrats who fled to foil Trump’s redistricting plan Gov. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump’s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election. The solution Newsom has proposed is a prudent one — redrawing just the congressional lines, not those for the state Legislature as well, and only doing so until the next census, when Trump will have passed from the scene. Cost was a reason to oppose the wishful-thinking 2021 recall election launched against Newsom (which he defeated with more than 60% of the vote), but the argument applies less so today given that Trump’s extreme unilateral actions — budget cuts and slashed programs, ICE raids, the attack on higher education, including the University of California — are putting California’s fiscal future at risk. Czech dissident-turned-statesman Vaclav Havel, in his famous essay “ The Power of the Powerless ,” described the Prague Spring not only as a “clash between two groups on the level of real power” but as the “final act … of a long drama originally played out chiefly in the theatre of the spirit and the conscience of society.” We do not know how the current drama will play out. If Trump continues to goad Texas into abandoning its commitment to the norms of our election rules, Americans who hold onto hope that their voices still matter will be counting on California to show the way.

The film and TV actor is best known for his work in the 1990s series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.” He was no Christopher Reeve or Henry Cavill. “If you want to save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America’s streets.” Later that day, Cain appeared on Fox News to claim he was going to “be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.” a role Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin later on clarified to the New York Times would be only honorary. Advertisement “Superman is encouraging Americans to become real-life superheroes,” it posted “by answering their country’s call to join the brave men and women of ICE to help protect our communities to arrest the worst of the worst.” American heroes used to storm Omaha Beach. (Chris Pizzello / Invision / Associated Press) Its appeal to Superman is part of their campaign to cast la migra as good guys while casting all undocumented people as shadowy villains who deserve deportation — the faster and nastier the better. In early June, they put Trump, who couldn’t leap over a bingo card in a single bound let alone a tall building, on the White House’s social media accounts in a Superman costume. In a 1950 poster, as McCarthyism was ramping up, DC Comics issued a poster in which Superman tells a group of kids that anyone who makes fun of people for their “religion, race or national origin ... is un-American.” Advertisement A decade later, Superman starred in a comic book public service announcement in which he chided a teen who said “Those refugee kids can’t talk English or play ball or anything” by taking him to a shabby camp to show the boy the hardships refugees had to endure. It might surprise you to know that in even more recent times, in a 2017 comic book, Superman saves a group of undocumented immigrants from a man in an American flag do-rag who opened fire on them. That’s who Superman né Cain says ICE is pursuing — the oft repeated “worst of the worst” — but Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse found that 71% of people currently held in ICE detention have no criminal records as of July 27 . I don’t think the real Superman — by whom I mean the fictional one whom Cain seems to think he’s the official spokesperson for just because he played him in a middling dramedy 30-some years ago — would waste his strength and X-ray vision to nab people like that.

Article: The scene at the dais in Riverside’s City Council chambers looked a bit different on a recent Monday morning: Instead of men and women in business attire, children wearing navy blue T-shirts emblazoned with vibrant orange and yellow butterfly wings occupied the swivel chairs. The children were participating in a mock council meeting as part of a summer leadership program run by TODEC, a legal center serving immigrants and farmworkers in the Inland Empire and Coachella Valley. Advertisement “When people are going through stuff like that they get emotional and they get sad,” explained incoming fifth-grader Montserrat Garcia, leaning into the microphone as she assumed the role of mayor. After a bit of discussion and guidance from Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson and TODEC executive director Luz Gallegos, the mock city council unanimously voted to fund mental health workshops for their community. “If you read about it, you hear about it in books, it’s nothing like being here and having the privilege of coming in and actually seeing how the process works.” Using civic knowledge to push for change That’s been the intention of Monarcas Luchadoras, which translates to monarchs in the struggle. “We are seeing kids as young as 4 years old knowing what ICE is, knowing that they may be undocumented, knowing that their parents and family and friends are undocumented,” she said. The students took advantage of a rare field trip and explored art installations at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture and learned about the historical figures whose statues make up the city’s Civil Rights Walk. At the museum, a few kids lingered in front of a painting of a low rider, while others ran toward an installation with glass seashells typically used to call out to gods such as the Aztec goddess Cihuateotl, who was depicted at the installation. Advertisement “They’re teaching me how to keep up our culture, how to help other people, not just ourselves, how to be nice and kind, how to be respectful,” fifth-grader Garcia said. Stepping up for Riverside’s immigrant community The children have learned a lot just by being in the environment, said Linda Cruz, whose three children soaked in the new experiences, including her 3-year-old daughter Mia, who joins the group at events like Monday’s field trip. “It’s giving them confidence that I think a lot of people in our community lack.” Gallegos and other TODEC leaders have pushed kids to think about solutions even if they’re not old enough to vote.

But Trump administration efforts to scale down the size of the VA by about 30,000 positions and to dismantle the Department of Education, which manages some student aid for veterans, have caused funding delays and are hampering students’ ability to understand and get answers about their education benefits, advocacy groups say. Advertisement “Part of the challenge of wrapping our arms around this is the opaqueness of the whole thing,” said Barmak Nassirian, vice president for higher education policy at Veterans Education Success. “We’re sort of feeling our way around the impact.” Frustration mounting “The whole process” has become a mess, said one 33-year-old Navy vet in Colorado, who asked that his name not be disclosed for fear of reprisal from federal authorities.

Vets struggle to get benefits The VA disruptions threaten “access to veterans’ education benefits , just as even more veterans and service members may be turning to higher education and career training,” the American Council on Education, or ACE — the nation’s largest association of colleges and universities — wrote in June. “Eligibility rules can be confusing,” ACE wrote, and are rife with “time-consuming red tape.” As a result, “many students and the institutions that serve them rely on VA staff to interpret the rules, resolve disputes, and ensure benefits are processed on time. Ten colleges and universities with the largest veteran enrollments in the nation — including San Diego State, Georgia State, Angelo State, Arizona State and Syracuse — also did not respond to, or declined to answer, questions. Advertisement In the military city of San Diego, where thousands of former and current service members go to college, student veterans at Miramar College this year waited months to hear about VA work-study contracts, which previously had been approved within days. Several recounted stories of veterans without degrees choosing to look for work rather than continue their education because of frustration with the VA — even though studies show that graduating from college can dramatically increase future earnings.

Article: At the LAPD, the number of Black recruits — especially women — has been dropping for years, leaving the department far short of diversity goals put in place decades ago to counter discriminatory hiring practices. Advertisement California How ICE is using the LAPD to track down immigrants for deportation LAPD leaders say the department has strict limits on cooperating with immigration officials, but court records show federal authorities are nevertheless using local police information sent to national databases to find new targets. The Oscar Joel Bryant Assn., which represents the LAPD’s 700 or so Black officers, said conversations about responding to attacks on pro-diversity programs “do not need to wait for the future.” Advertisement “[T]hose concerns are here today for all groups,” Capt. “When we swore an oath to protect the Constitution and the organization’s very mission statement elevates DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) principles, I do not see how we can step away from them now or ever.” Privately, some Black department officials expressed frustration with recent promotions announced by McDonnell. California LAPD undergoes first major leadership shake-up with McDonnell as chief LAPD Jim McDonnell has given new assignments to more than a dozen officials from the Police Department’s upper ranks, elevating three deputy chiefs to top positions and resurrecting a long-dormant bureau. Several high-ranking Black LAPD officials, including Tingirides and Deputy Chiefs Gerald Woodyard and Alan Hamilton, have already enrolled in the deferred retirement program, meaning they probably will exit before the 2028 Olympic Games in L.A. This year, an officer from the department’s recruitment unit filed a complaint alleging he had recorded racist, sexist and homophobic comments by colleagues, which McDonnell and other officials condemned and pledged to investigate. Over the last decade, the department has paid out more than $10 million in settlements or jury awards for officers alleging that they were discriminated against based on their race. But a succession of LAPD leaders have said that diversifying the agency’s ranks is a priority, arguing that doing so can counter generations of distrust of police by Black Angelenos. Since the start of his second term in office, Trump has called diversity hiring efforts “illegal,” encouraging federal agencies to investigate and withhold funds from institutions that promote DEI practices. Ivonne Roman of the Center for Policing Equity, a nonprofit think tank based at Yale University, said the president’s anti-affirmative orders will undoubtedly undercut efforts to turn the tide on declining Black officer numbers nationwide.

Article: The facility can hold up to 335 migrants, but there were just two people in one of the holding rooms on Monday, the members said at a news conference in downtown L.A. “It’s alarming that it’s taken so long for congressional members to gain access to this site,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, a nonprofit that seeks to protect the rights of immigrants. Sherman, who represents parts of the San Fernando Valley and Pacific Palisades, said that one of the two detainees at B-18 on Monday rested with his head on a table. A federal judge last month temporarily barred the government from mass sweeps in Los Angeles and seven nearby counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that the targets are in the U.S. The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which sued the federal government over the sweeps, described B-18 as “dungeon-like” and accused the administration of failing to “provide basic necessities like food, water, adequate hygiene facilities, and medical care.” Detainees were allegedly subjected to overcrowding and did not have adequate sleeping accommodations. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has said that claims of poor conditions at ICE detention centers are “false” and that the agency “has higher detention standards than most U.S. She said the representatives replied, “That’s not us, and we go in if there’s probable cause, if there’s a warrant out there.” Gomez, who has been repeatedly turned away from entering the B-18 facility since the crackdown started earlier this year, is part of a group of Democratic House members suing the federal government over the lack of access. The lawsuit, filed last month in federal district court in Washington, said the individuals attempted to visit a detention facility, either by showing up in person or by giving Homeland Security Department officials advance notice, and were unlawfully blocked from entering. Advertisement ICE recently published new guidelines for members of Congress and their staff, requesting at least 72 hours’ notice from lawmakers and requiring at least 24 hours’ notice from staff before an oversight visit.

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, file) GENEVA -- A U.N.-backed investigator says his team has turned up significant evidence of “systemic torture” in Myanmar's detention centers, including electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and burning of sexual body parts over the last year. The team said it has made advances in identifying security personnel involved in operations at the detention facilities and “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.” Perpetrators included security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups, it said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.” “We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he said. His team has opened new investigations into atrocities committed against communities in Rakhine state as the military and the opposition force known as the Arakan Army battle for control of the territory. The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been working since 2018 under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to help document rights abuses and violations in the country.

There was no formal government announcement about the launch of the offensive in Bajaur, a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, but a government administrator, Saeed Ullah, said that it was not a large-scale operation and only insurgent hideouts were being hit to avoid any civilian casualties.

Article: Americans with a credit score of 620 or below pay about $3,400 per year for essential financial products in what Bankrate, in a new report, calls a "subprime tax." The "subprime tax" comes in the form of higher interest rates on products such as mortgages, credit cards, auto and personal loans, and pricier premiums on auto and home insurance. Compared with that group, subprime borrowers also pay $745 more annually in auto loan interest, $514 more in auto insurance premiums, $398 more in home insurance premiums, $328 more in personal loan interest, and $89 more in credit card interest.

Article: The National Hurricane Center currently has a 90% chance of tropical development on the system, but most forecast models are in agreement about a gradual increase to hurricane strength by this weekend. While the eventual path of this system isn't set in stone, forecast models are currently showing it as more of a threat to the east coast of the US than a threat to us here in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center currently has a 80% chance of tropical development on the system, but most forecast models are in agreement about a gradual increase to hurricane strength by next weekend. That particular wave is just coming off the coast of Africa, meaning that even if it were to eventually impact the U.S., it wouldn't be for another 10 to 12 days, giving us plenty of time to keep a watchful eye on it. August 3 There is now a low chance for development over the eastern Atlantic as a tropical wave is expected to move off the coast of Africa in the next day or two. July 29 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms and two named storms, the Atlantic Basin remains quiet for now with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 28 Update While the central and eastern Pacific basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: “I laugh at the Democrats who are now all of a sudden so interested in the Epstein files,” Vance said in an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. And now President Trump has demanded full transparency from this, and yet somehow the Democrats are attacking him, and not the Biden administration, which did nothing for four years.” Vance is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger. And it was Trump’s Department of Justice that gave Epstein a so-called “sweetheart deal.” But on top of that, Vance is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger. The allure of the Epstein files, for those most interested in them, is the conviction that Epstein’s social scene reveals a secret world of elite exploitation and impunity that spans the political spectrum. And insofar as the rumors about Epstein track with the (preposterous) QAnon conspiracy theory, its proponents believe that politicians and plutocrats on the left side of the spectrum stand to lose the most. A Reuters-Ipsos poll from mid-July found that about a third of Republicans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the issue and that 62% believed that the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list. That poll also found that 82% of Democrats disapproved of Trump’s handling of the issue, and that the same percentage believed the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list. They’re calling out Trump his allies out for promising to release the Epstein files and boasting that the Epstein client list was allegedly sitting on the attorney general’s desk, and then saying there was no list.

Article: He specifically called out New York Attorney General Letitia James, the trailblazing prosecutor who beat Trump and the Trump organization in court; a judge found that Trump and the organization improperly inflated assets in financial documents to get favorable loan terms. In November 2023, as the trial was ongoing, Trump made a social media post characterizing James’s prosecution against him as a “ridiculous Political Witch Hunt against me” and wrote, “She should be prosecuted!” At a campaign rally in January 2024, he said the judge and James “should be arrested and punished accordingly.” He appears to be actively making good on those vows to pay back the people he says wrong him even though the facts and evidence don’t appear to justify it. NBC News reported Friday that Attorney General Pam Bondi has made MAGA activist Ed Martin a “special attorney” to probe mortgage fraud allegations against James made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William J. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, sent James’s office two subpoenas last week that seek to discover if she violated the rights of Trump and his businesses, as well as the rights of the National Rifle Association. In fact, that panel refused to extend his appointment, and the DOJ got around that rejection with a maneuver that appears to have never been used for the appointment of a U.S. According to a letter The New York Times obtained from the Justice Department’s human resources division, Sarcone has been named “special attorney to the attorney general” indefinitely and is, bizarrely, serving as the acting U.S. His consolation prize was being made DOJ’s pardon attorney and director of DOJ’s “weaponization” working group, which Bondi established with the apparent mission to investigate public officials who — following the facts, law and court rules — secured indictments against Trump. Of the two, Martin is the bigger threat to the rule of law — that is, treating like cases alike — and the bigger threat to the DOJ’s post-Watergate norm of keeping partisan politics out of DOJ decision making. James’s lawyer told ABC News that the accusation was a “lie based on a purposeful misreading of documents in a lawful real estate transaction.” In a letter to Attorney General Bondi in April, that attorney, Abbe D. James’ principal residence and at the same time absolutely ignored her very clear and all caps statement two weeks earlier to the mortgage loan broker that “[t]his property WILL NOT be my primary residence.” Lowell attached email messages that he said show that James was clear that the property would be her niece’s primary residence and that the “broker understood this” because he responded that James would be considered “a non-occupying co-borrower.” Another allegation from Trump’s FHFA says James wrongly claimed that a five-unit dwelling she bought in Brooklyn in 2001 only had four units — as the Times explains “possibly in order to receive better interest rates.” But in the letter Lowell sent Bondi in April, the attorney writes, “The co-occupancy dwelling has four floors and, for as long as Ms. James has lived there, the property has always functioned as a four-person residence.” Lowell said that a 24-year-old certificate of occupancy mistakenly says it’s a 5-unit property, but he attached copies of multiple public documents that he say prove it’s a 4-unit property. What Trump’s DOJ is doing now appears to have been pulled from the same playbook his DOJ used against Democratic governors in New York and New Jersey during his first term. According to that report, in 2020, most of the nursing homes with the lowest quality of care during the Covid pandemic were in the Republican-governed states of Texas and Indiana. However, the report mentions an alarming text message a senior official with DOJ’s Office of Public Affairs sent to at least one colleague on October 17, 2020, weeks before the presidential election. Using DOJ shorthand for the civil rights division and the civil division respectively the text, according to the IG report, said, “I’m trying to get [CRT] and CIV to do letters to [New York/New Jersey] respectively on nursing homes. Will be our last play on them before election but it’s a big one.” “Our last play on them before the election.” Put plainly, DOJ officials were weaponizing the department’s vast powers to attack the president’s political opponents for partisan purposes.

Article: Since President Trump’s return to office, the Department of Justice has increasingly targeted the president’s critics and opponents, including an investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted the Trump Organization for fraud. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell, who is representing James, says that Trump’s “retribution” agenda “makes George Orwell’s ‘1984’ look like a Mother Goose nursery rhyme.” “The manipulation of language” from the administration, Lowell says, “makes your head spin." This politicization of the DOJ, Lowell argues, makes “Department of Weaponization” a more fitting name. He says that Trump’s end goal in this, it seems, is a regime where “only Democrats get scrutinized” while Republicans and Trump allies “get a free pass.” Lowell notes that he does not view his work as partisan, and he has represented figures across the political spectrum, including both Ivanka Trump and Hunter Biden.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that "all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same." Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. Reaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes - tariffs - on almost every country on earth. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. warn of price hike as new tariffs set to take effect "By overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,'' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. "The administration's desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris." It's unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America's biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing's subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. Reade doesn't expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets.

Article: Thailand’s army is warning that it may have to“exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines Thailand warns it may act in 'self-defense' after soldier hurt by a mine blast near Cambodian border BANGKOK -- Thailand’s army warned that it may have to “exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia, in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines. Winthai Suvaree said a sergeant was patrolling the border with seven other soldiers Tuesday morning when he ”stepped on an anti-personnel landmine covertly planted by the Cambodian side, resulting in severe injuries to his left ankle.” The incident and the Thai reaction indicates the precariousness of the ceasefire that took effect on July 29 with the aim of ending five days of armed clashes over disputed territory along their border. “This incident serves as clear evidence that the Cambodian side has violated the ceasefire agreement and shows no respect for international humanitarian law, particularly the Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use and placement of all types of anti-personnel landmines,” said the Thai army statement about the latest incident. The statement noted the multiple similar incidents and declared that Thailand “has consistently adhered to peaceful approaches and has not been the initiating party.” “However, should circumstances become compelling, it may be necessary to exercise the right of self-defense under international law principles to resolve situations that cause Thailand to continuously lose personnel due to violations of ceasefire agreements and sovereignty encroachments by Cambodian military forces,” it warned. “Cambodia, as a proud and responsible State Party to the Ottawa Convention, maintains an absolute and uncompromising position: we have never used, produced, or deployed new landmines under any circumstances, and we strictly and fully honor our obligations under international law,” she said, echoing previous official denials. Ly Thuch, senior minister and first vice-president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970, according to an interview with the Cambodian state news agency AKP.

Zelenskyy has warned that Russia is planning further offensives and cannot be trusted, while European leaders have been scrambling to try and influence Trump and get Ukraine a seat at the table. European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: "How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?" Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed. Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. Reaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes – tariffs – on almost every country on earth. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other’s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,'' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. "The administration’s desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.” It’s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America’s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing’s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. Reade doesn’t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets.

Article: Why lung cancer is a 'hidden epidemic' in this part of the world Eleanor Ceres found out she had lung cancer after the tumor spread from her chest and began protruding out her neck. In fact, based on mortality rates, it seems that lung cancer is only a problem in South Africa — the richest country in the region — and, in particular, the Western Cape — the province with the most efficient and well-resourced health care system. toggle caption Simar Bajaj for NPR Africa's hidden lung cancer epidemic, as Koegelenberg calls it, is part of a larger crisis in global health, as infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV have increasingly come under control and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become an existential threat. Sponsor Message Why lung cancer goes undiagnosed There are almost no nerve endings in the lungs, so in the early stages, the most common symptom of lung cancer is no symptom at all, says Dr. "Patients would go through the whole treatment regimen for tuberculosis and not really be investigated for lung cancer," says Lorraine Govender, a nurse and the national manager of health promotion at The Cancer Association of South Africa. Those lost six to nine months of possible treatment can be deadly, since 55% of people with lung cancer die within a year, according to Cancer Research UK "The lack of training for health care providers to identify lung cancer is a big problem," she adds. Tuberculosis may play an even more direct role, given that patients with this disease are twice as likely to get lung cancer than those without — likely due to this bacterial disease causing lung inflammation and DNA damage. "In Africa, where we don't have the screening and diagnosis available, we may see deaths from cancer but not know what cancer the patient actually died from," Govender says, "or maybe have deaths and not know it was cancer." Sponsor Message Autopsies could help answer these questions but are rarely performed for religious and cultural reasons, says Dr. Okonta thinks sub-Saharan Africa is in a catch-22 on lung cancer, where systemic undercounting leads to limited data and limited data allows governments to ignore this disease and the need for better record-keeping. "Once you are actually so far gone, there's really no point." toggle caption Simar Bajaj for NPR Skyrocketing smoking rates across sub-Saharan Africa means the lung cancer problem is likely to get worse, as tobacco companies target the region to replace falling sales in the West. Especially at risk are communities like Khayelitsha, a racially segregated township on the outskirts of Cape Town, as tobacco companies often flood poor areas with cheap cigarettes and aggressive marketing. Mbulelo Shicani, a lung cancer patient here, says that he buys a pack of cigarettes for 10 rand, or 50 cents, and that these prices have actually been coming down . "We obviously diagnose lung cancer a lot better compared to the rest of the country and the rest of the continent," Mnguni says, given that the Western Cape has the strongest health care system in South Africa and perhaps all of sub-Saharan Africa. and lung cancer patients only receive palliative care upon diagnosis" — For those in Khayelitsha, they're almost always facing such advanced disease that "we don't even refer them to the oncologist," Mnguni says. Why screening isn't an easy solution One way to find tumors and treat them early is with lung cancer screening , especially given that pharmaceutical companies , such as AstraZeneca and Chinese firm BGI Genomics, see Africa as a key region for innovation and investment. So, in 2019, Koegelenberg and Dheda created the first lung cancer screening guidelines in sub-Saharan Africa, and Discovery, the largest private health-insurance provider in South Africa, started covering screening several months ago, Koegelenberg says. Dheda openly acknowledges that lung cancer screening isn't practical for the 84% of South Africans in the public system, or even most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, "although we should be screening and we know we should be screening," he says. Even if there were enough CT scanners to screen high-risk individuals, there wouldn't be capacity to biopsy nodules and treat all these cases, given budget shortfalls and rapidly growing waitlists. "For most limited resource countries, the best bet is to prevent people from getting the disease." This too is easier said than done, given pressure from tobacco companies and the need for greater social support to help people manage addiction. "What are you going to offer in the place of smoking when communities are living in stress?" Change may be on the way Despite these challenges, Meyer is hopeful about the future. South African lawmakers are considering a new smoking law that would ban all tobacco and e-cigarette advertising, as well as raise penalties to 15 years of jail time for businesses that sell tobacco to children or at cut-rate low prices. Furthermore, recent research from Vietnam suggests that lung cancer screening might be feasible with chest x-rays and artificial intelligence , which is a more realistic, scalable option for sub-Saharan Africa, Koegelenberg says. "Maybe the government will start paying attention to lung cancer." "We must stop hiding behind, 'Oh, it's not going to be affordable,'" Meyer says, since the cost of inaction is far too high. "We must just do it."

Article: A Chinese warship crashed into one of its own country’s coast guard vessels as it chased a patrol boat belonging to the Philippines, officials in Manila said Monday, after the latest territorial dispute in the South China Sea. The dramatic collision near the Scarborough Shoal, a contested island, came as the Filipino vessel was delivering fuel and supplies to more than 30 fishing boats, the country’s coast guard said in a statement Monday. Several videos posted on X by Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson for the Philippines Coast Guard, showed the Chinese ships on both sides of their coast guard vessel, traveling at quite a pace. Another video showed the Chinese coast guard ship bearing the number 3104, appears to be bearing down on the back of the Filipino boat, when the warship appears from the left of shot in front. Instead, it accused the Philippines of “intruding into waters” under the “pretext” of supplies, near the island which it called China’s “inherent territory.” It said it had acted in a “professional, regulated and lawful” manner. The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs said in its statement that it was “seriously concerned” by China’s “dangerous maneuvers.” The collision demonstrated the “importance of adhering to international maritime rules,” it said, adding that the crew of the patrols ship had “without hesitation offered medical aid and other relevant support to the Chinese side.” It is unclear whether this offer was accepted. Beijing claims sovereignty in over 80% of the South China Sea, energy-rich waters with estimated 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil below them. In the last decade, China has been been actively building artificial islands in the region and added military bases, ports, and airstrips, drawing criticism from the Philippines and Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, who also lay claim to parts of the South China Sea. In 2016, an international court ruled overwhelmingly in favor of the Philippines, declaring that many of China’s claims and actions in the South China Sea violated international law and rights of the Philippines.

Article: On August 5, 2019, the Indian government stripped the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state of its special status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, split it into two entities and demoted the two units to Union Territories under New Delhi’s direct control. The bombshell that came on the sixth anniversary was an official order banning 25 books that focus on Jammu and Kashmir’s history and politics – all accused of promoting “false narratives” and “secessionism” – a sweeping judgement that does not stand the test of scrutiny and is not based on any evidence. The government justified the actions of August 5, 2019 on the grounds that they would usher in peace and development in the region, while glossing over the unprecedented physical and cyber-restrictions imposed across the erstwhile state, during which thousands of people, including pro-India politicians (three former chief ministers included), were arrested. Barbed wire and military barricades turned the region, particularly the Kashmir Valley, into a curfewed zone, and communication channels – from internet to telephone lines – were pushed into some black hole. Advertisement Six months later, when some of these restrictions were slightly eased and the internet was partially restored, the stranglehold of the Indian state became even more oppressive, with an exacerbation of raids and crackdowns against journalists, political and social activists, and civil rights defenders. The policy of widespread detentions under laws like the Public Safety Act, which allows the government to detain anyone without charge for up to two years, was ramped up significantly. Focused on the first two years of the revocation of Article 370, and in 12 chapters, I documented what was happening on the ground – the increased suppression of the masses, the lack of space for freedom of expression, the shrinking space for civil society and political activism, the criminalisation of dissent, the continuation of terrorism as opposed to the claims of peace and normalcy, and the hollowness of the development claims by the government even as the new policies and actions robbed the people of their homes and agricultural lands. A paranoid state whose only method of engagement in Jammu and Kashmir is through increasing its military footprint, merciless subjugation of the residents and silencing of all voices of dissent was obviously uncomfortable with what I documented. Advertisement In the last six years, the government has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the world by trumpeting its achievements of bringing peace, normalcy, tourism and development. The ban on 25 books, many of which provide rich, well-researched, and layered historical, political and legal narratives about the complex and trouble-torn region, is an extension of the pattern. Though senseless, shocking and irrational in scale and scope, the ban, which ironically coincides with a government-backed Chinar Book Festival in Srinagar, sends a chilling message: Knowledge and information will be regulated by the state. Last year, during Jammu and Kashmir’s first assembly elections as a Union Territory, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, took a dig at the regional political parties and alleged that while “they (local politicians) gave the youth stones in their hands”, his government had given them “books and laptops”. The hollowness of such claims is laid bare when the daily reality is one of confiscation of digital devices, including laptops, during raids and interrogations, alongside a blanket book ban that only reinforces the central message of my work: Kashmir is anything but normal.

Article: A Texas woman is suing a key group that provides abortion pills by mail and a former sexual partner, who she alleges terminated her pregnancy by lacing her drink with medication he obtained from the group. In the complaint, filed Monday in Texas federal court by a prominent antiabortion attorney, the woman alleges that her ex-partner bought the pills from Aid Access, a nonprofit based in Europe, then pressured her to take them for weeks in the spring, even though she told him she did not want an abortion. doctors affiliated with the group have been able to mail the medication to patients in all 50 states under the protection of “shield” laws designed to safeguard providers from prosecution in states with abortion bans. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The wrongful-death lawsuit alleges that Aid Access violated the federal Comstock Act, an 1873 law that bans the mailing of “obscene” materials, including those related to abortion. Advertisement The attorney behind the case is Jonathan Mitchell, who is known for counseling private citizens on suing people who facilitate abortions — and who designed the Texas law that enables such cases. (The Post is not naming the woman because of the nature of her allegations in the civil suit.) Advertisement Advertisement Monday’s complaint appears to be the first time a woman has filed a wrongful-death abortion lawsuit in federal court. “Some of this is having that really sympathetic case and saying, ‘Look how irresponsible the defendants were, that they were willing to give whomever these medications and that person took it and used it in nefarious ways,’” said Carmel Shachar, a law professor at Harvard Law School. Advertisement She did so, the lawsuit says, because she “viewed this as a last-ditch opportunity to get on reasonable terms.” On April 5, he visited the woman’s home and made her hot chocolate, according to the complaint. When asked about the alleged incident, a spokesperson for the department said Corpus Christi police had “a few reports involving those individuals” but no active investigations as of Monday afternoon. Wade was overturned, abortion advocates have worried that conservatives would use the Comstock Act as a legal vehicle to shut down abortion pill mailing, a network propelled by Aid Access. Attempts from conservative attorneys and state prosecutors, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), to legally target providers affiliated with Aid Access, which is incorporated in Austria, and other physicians who practice under shield laws have stalled thus far. The new effort from Mitchell, the woman’s attorney, couples the Comstock Act with state law, as he did last month in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the California doctor, which also cited the federal law.

Article: Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added.

Article: Finland Moomins Fans celebrate the 80th anniversary of the publication of the Finnish children's classic, "The Moomins and The Great Flood," and the birthday of the author Tove Jansson, in Tampere, Finland, Saturday, Aug. (AP Photo/Tommi Ojala) Finland Moomins Fans celebrate the 80th anniversary of the publication of the Finnish children's classic, "The Moomins and The Great Flood," and the birthday of the author Tove Jansson, in Tampere, Finland, Saturday, Aug. The series, set in the fictional Moominvalley, has been translated into more than 60 languages, and sparked movie and TV adaptations, children's plays, art gallery exhibitions and an eponymous museum — plus theme parks in Finland and Japan. On Saturday, fans flocked to Tampere in southern Finland — home of the Moomin Museum — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the 1945 publication as well as Jansson's Aug. "I just carried that love for Moomin, for Tove Jansson, with me into my adult life.” When Senn met her now-wife, Lizzie, they were initially in a long-distance relationship for the first year and a half. “You buy a Moomin mug, you like the characters, you maybe see something on TV — but we all go back to the books, the original illustrations.” Depictions of the character Stinky, described as a lovable rogue who has captured Moominmamma’s heart, generated debate and outcry in Finland this summer after reports emerged in Finnish media that Stinky was removed from a mural in an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library in New York due to concerns that the cartoon might be perceived as racist. “A single image of Stinky was removed from the youth wing — which had the potential to be negatively misconstrued by young children without a fuller understanding of the Moomin universe,” the library said Monday in a statement to The Associated Press. "However, Stinky does appear in other areas of the exhibition and the Moomins books remain available for patrons to check out as they always have.” Jansson's drawings of Stinky shows the character with a dark, fuzzy body, with skinny legs and antennae. “To me, this became as quite a big surprise because I have more thought about Stinky being close to a mole or a vole," Sirke Happonen, a Moomins scholar and associate professor at the University of Helsinki, said of the library's decision. Her partner of more than 45 years, engraver and artist Tuulikki Pietilä, was memorialized as the character Too-ticky in “Moominland Midwinter.” The couple lived in Helsinki and spent their summers on the small rocky island of Klovharu in the Gulf of Finland until the 1990s. She felt it was very difficult to paint, and she started writing what she called a fairy tale, but she excused herself not to include princesses or princes,” Happonen said.

Rossi, 38, was arrested in Scotland in 2021 — a year after he was reported dead — when he was recognized at a Glasgow hospital while receiving treatment for COVID-19. The woman, who the judge asked not be identified publicly, described a whirlwind relationship with Rossi that began in November 2008 while she was recovering from a traumatic brain injury. Rossi's lawyers sought to convince the jury that the alleged victim built up years of resentment after Rossi made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship, and accused him of rape to get back at him a decade later when she saw him in the news. And when you start going through everything, you're not going to get a complete picture.” Prosecutors pushed back, saying that if any “puzzle pieces” are missing, it's because Rossi's attorneys fought to have some evidence dismissed.

Article: Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know By ISABEL DEBRE Associated Press and PAOLA FLORES Associated Press Bolivian presidential candidate Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga attends his campaign rally ahead of the upcoming presidential election, in La Paz, Bolivia, Thursday, Aug. Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth. In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin. The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president — both of whom have run and lost three times before — and a young leftist Senate leader. “The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers. “But the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,” Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom. A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia’s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term. Dubbed the “eternal candidate,” he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia’s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader's popularity. Now once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size. “These are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization." Doria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation's foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising “No more lines!” If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales.

And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and ’80s such as “Maneater,” “Rich Girl” “Kiss on My List” and “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do).” Robb Harvey, an attorney for Hall, declined to comment. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the “ultimate partnership betrayal” by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall’s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership.

Article: Officials are working to determine the cause of an explosion that rocked a steel plant outside Pittsburgh, leaving two dead and 10 injured Officials are investigating the cause of a Pennsylvania steel plant explosion that killed 2 By MARC LEVY Associated Press , GENE PUSKAR Associated Press , MICHAEL CASEY Associated Press , and PATRICK WHITTLE Associated Press A portion of the Clairton Coke Works, a U.S. -- An explosion rocked a steel plant outside Pittsburgh, leaving two dead and 10 others injured, including a person who was rescued from the smoldering rubble after hours of being trapped. In a statement, the United Steelworkers, which represents many of the Clairton plant’s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” U.S. The county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors, but lifted the advisory later Monday. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, killing a police officer A bullet hole is visible in the door of a CVS pharmacy on Saturday, August 9, 2025, near where police say a man was shooting at the headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (AP Photo/Jeff Amy) A bullet hole is visible in the door of a CVS pharmacy on Saturday, August 9, 2025, near where police say a man was shooting at the headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (AP Photo/Jeff Amy) A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the attack, had also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. A union representing workers at the CDC said the shooting was not random and “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured." It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk. Here's what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation: Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. The police chief added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was “complex” and the investigation would take “an extended period of time." The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.” Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release. is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through "his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust.” Kennedy reached out to staff on Saturday, saying “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” In a statement provided Monday, HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy “has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” Nixon added that Rose's “sacrifice to protect the CDC on its darkest day will never be forgotten.” Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the campus. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff. A neighbor of White's told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.

Article: Tesla is recruiting test drivers in New York to operate cars with "automated driving systems," but the company hasn't applied for the permits it would need to test autonomous vehicles in the nation's largest city. The hires will be "responsible for driving an engineering vehicle for extended periods, conducting dynamic audio and camera data collection for testing and training purposes." A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation told CNBC on Monday that Tesla has not applied for approvals to test AVs on city streets in New York. Any company that obtains a permit to test AVs in New York has to keep "a trained safety driver behind the wheel, ready to take control of an AV-enabled vehicle at all times," according to the DOT spokesperson. Tesla's EV sales have been on the decline this year, especially in Europe, partly due to Musk's decision to focus on the Cybertruck, rather than producing a more affordable EV with mainstream appeal. Some of the company's struggles are the result of a political backlash against Tesla because of Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, work with President Donald Trump, and endorsements of Germany's anti-immigrant AfD party. Along with its recruiting efforts in Queens, Tesla is also seeking to hire test drivers for its Autopilot team to gather data from drives in cities and suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando and Miami, as well as Palo Alto, California, home to Tesla's engineering headquarters.

Article: The soldier’s left ankle was badly damaged on Tuesday after he stepped on the device while patrolling about 1km (0.6 miles) from the Ta Moan Thom Temple in Thailand’s Surin province, the army said. The statement warned that if violations continued, Thailand might “exercise the right of self-defence under international law principles to resolve situations that cause Thailand to continuously lose personnel due to violations of ceasefire agreements and sovereignty encroachments by Cambodian military forces”. “Cambodia, as a proud and responsible State Party to the Ottawa Convention, maintains an absolute and uncompromising position: we have never used, produced, or deployed new landmines under any circumstances, and we strictly and fully honour our obligations under international law,” the Cambodian Ministry of National Defence said in a social media post. Those battles, the worst between the neighbours in more than a decade, saw exchanges of artillery fire and air strikes that killed at least 43 people and displaced more than 300,000 on both sides. Thailand has accused Cambodia of planting mines on its side of the border, which stretches 817km (508 miles), with ownership of the Ta Moan Thom and 11th-century Preah Vihear temples at the heart of the dispute.

Article: President Donald Trump, joined by Republican lawmakers, signs the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act into law during an Independence Day military family picnic on the South Lawn of the White House on July 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. The CBO estimates that the 10% of poorest Americans will lose roughly $1,200 a year as they experience restrictions on government programs like Medicaid and food assistance, while the richest 10% of Americans will see their income increase by $13,600 from tax cuts. Overall, American households will see more income from the tax cuts in the legislation, including middle income households, but the largest benefit will go to the top 10% of earners. "CBO has a troubled track record of getting its estimates incorrect and, like Democrats, is biased in favor of more federal spending and higher taxes," Smith said on social media. "Don't buy it." Republicans have been eager to sell the upsides of the legislation — arguing that the tax cuts will spur economic growth — while they are on a monthlong summer break from Washington. "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill is putting America First like never before, delivering huge savings for hardworking families, boosting our economy, and securing our borders," said White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson in a statement last week.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: Presented with data showing job growth in the United States slowing to a 16-year low, the president fired Erica McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics without cause. He proceeded to tell Americans that his own administration’s job numbers should be seen as “rigged,” “ridiculous,” “phony” and a “scam” — baseless claims that the Republican appeared to make up to justify his own outlandish and authoritarian-style decision. In other words, Trump has already decided that the economy is in great shape, reality notwithstanding, and he’s confident that his handpicked loyalist will produce statistics that meet the White House’s standards for “accuracy.” In the same missive, the Republican described Antoni as a “Highly Respected Economist.” There’s ample evidence to the contrary. Jason Furman, for example, is an accomplished Harvard economist who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, and he responded to Antoni’s nomination this way: “I don’t think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise.” Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, added, “Let’s focus on qualifications: Antoni finished grad school 5 years ago at Northern Illinois with no distinction. Going forward, everyone — from policymakers to economists, Federal Reserve officials to investors, business owners to regular ol’ American workers — will now have reason to question the integrity of the data from the U.S.

Article: inflation was unchanged in July while a measure of underlying inflation rose to its highest level in five months as tariffs push the price of imported goods higher while gas and grocery prices cooled. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. WATCH: As Trump’s tariffs kick in, economist breaks down inflation and recession warning signs The figures suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. WATCH: Firing of labor statistics head undermines trust in key data, ex-Trump official warns Adding to the BLS’s turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump’s 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.

He told CNBC earlier this week that he believes gold prices could exceed his $4,000 target price, adding on Tuesday that the president's confirmation that the metal is exempt from so-called reciprocal tariffs frees up room for gold to soar to new heights. This means that the bull market in the yellow metal may only be in its very first inning." Tariffs 'create havoc on the ground' UBS is also forecasting an increase in the price of spot gold. "The recent debacle over the US's gold import classifications signals how tariff pronouncements, interpretations, and subsequent practical application by different parts of the Trump administration can create havoc on the ground," they said.

Article: One of their most famous activities is the nonviolent commandeering of local buses: The practice is so common that many bus drivers know to simply step aside when their vehicle is boarded. "It’s safe to say the media has always been against them, calling them vandals and things like that." Padilla explained that this perception stems from the educational programme at the normal schools, which is rooted in socialist and collectivist politics. The most infamous incident took place in September 2014, when 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College, another normal school, took over a bus in the state of Guerrero.

Article: Before stepping back into the Oval Office in January, United States President Donald Trump promised numerous times that he would broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine “within 24 hours”. “Between Putin’s senile stubbornness and Trump’s spontaneousness, everything can still change 100 times over,” said Katherine, a St Petersburg pensioner who asked that her surname be withheld because she feared repercussions. “God willing, they agree to end the war, of course.” In recent months, Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin’s unwillingness to halt attacks on Ukraine, calling recent strikes on Kyiv “disgusting”. It is clear this meeting is a symbolic victory for Russia by the very fact it is being held, regardless that no one expects any results from it,” Budraitskis told Al Jazeera. “It is a proof of the effectiveness of [Putin’s] strategy, which is that there is no need to make any compromises – you need to stubbornly repeat your maximalist positions, and at some point, everyone will be so tired of this that they will be forced to accept them, and the international isolation of Russia will gradually disappear.” Budraitskis believes the meeting holds a similar value for Trump. “What the symbolic meaning of this meeting is for Trump is in showing he continues to play a key role in the situation in Ukraine, that he is the only person who is capable of talking to Putin, whom Putin listens to and respects.” While Russia currently occupies vast chunks of eastern Ukraine, Ukraine no longer occupies any Russian territory after being ousted from the Kursk region of western Russia earlier this year. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Russian and US diplomats were hammering out a deal that would allow Russia to keep the territory it has conquered so far, halting its invasion along the existing battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of southern Ukraine. The Polish online newspaper Onet said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff proposed to Putin a de facto recognition of what the Kremlin considers its “new territories” and the lifting of sanctions. Advertisement Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fired back in a Telegram post on Saturday, reiterating: “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.” But Zelenskyy will not be present at Friday’s meeting. “This is an eloquent signal that both Trump and Putin understand the destructive position of Zelenskyy and European officials for the development of mutually acceptable agreements, who, by the way, are persistently trying to include the Ukrainian leader in the agenda of the event.” Budraitskis said certain token measures may be granted without seriously hindering the war effort. “It’s possible that Putin will take some symbolic steps, for example limiting or temporarily refraining from bombing Ukraine, because, in general, this aerial warfare does little to help advance Russian troops.” Although Putin and Trump have spoken several times by phone this year, Friday’s talks will mark the first face-to-face meeting between the two statesmen since they met in Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, but because the United States is not a member of the ICC, it is under no obligation to arrest him.

Article: inflation was unchanged in July while a measure of underlying inflation rose to its highest level in five months as tariffs push the price of imported goods higher while gas and grocery prices cooled. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.

Article: DALLAS — A week after the DallasNews Corporation board called a shareholder meeting to vote on a proposed merger with Hearst, competing bidder Alden Global Capital increased its buyout offer. 4, the DallasNews Board called for a meeting and asked shareholders to approve the proposed merger with Hearst, calling it "the superior offer." "We are perplexed by your refusal to have a single discussion with us in the weeks since our original proposal was submitted," MNG wrote in a letter to the board. Today, we are submitting this Enhanced Proposal to further demonstrate our commitment to a transaction between MNG and DallasNews." The DallasNews said in its letter to shareholders that Robert W. Decherd previously stated that he will never agree to a buyout offer from Alden Global Capital, and the board argued that without Decherd's approval, a buyout agreement could not be reached. "Should Alden thwart the Hearst Merger, it will have succeeded only in destroying tens of millions of dollars of potential shareholder value represented by the Hearst Merger," the DallasNews said in a press release. "You should not summarily dismiss an offer that is clearly better for Dallas News’ shareholders and the readers of The Dallas Morning News alike." Alden has attracted controversy for focusing on cost-cutting at the newspapers it owns, according to the Dallas Business Journal. By 2018, the newsroom had shrunk by nearly two-thirds to around 70, prompting the editorial board of the Post to publish a public rebuke of Alden, the Dallas Business Journal reported. In a letter to the board, Alden said it is committed to maintaining the print edition of The Dallas Morning News and respects the newspaper's service to the North Texas community.

Article: A dating app, a niqab and a 9mm gun - how a US woman was hired to end a UK family feud 49 minutes ago Share Save Caroline Gall BBC News, West Midlands Lauren Potts BBC News Share Save Police handout US citizen Aimee Betro had virtually no "criminal footprint" before the shooting in Birmingham, UK, police say On an autumn night six years ago, Betro pointed a 9mm gun at Sikander Ali in a suburban cul-de-sac and pulled the trigger, as she had been hired to do. Police handout Betro, pictured in a shop in Birmingham, was extradited to the UK from Armenia earlier this year In 2018, Mohammed Aslam and his son Mohammed Nabil Nazir were injured during a fight at a shop owned by Mr Ali's father, Aslat Mahumad. The clash sparked a violent feud between the families, Birmingham Crown Court heard, which "clearly led Nazir and Aslam to conspire to have someone kill Aslat Mahumad or a member of his family". The pair, from Derby, turned to Betro - a woman not known by police "to have a huge footprint criminally" in the US or anywhere, according to Det Ch Insp Alastair Orencas from West Midlands Police's major crime unit. "On the face of it, a normal-looking individual [but] prepared to do an outrageous, audacious and persistent murder." Police handout Betro was captured firing directly at the family home in Measham Grove Betro, a childhood development and graphic design graduate from the US city of West Allis, arrived in the UK in August 2019 to carry out Aslam and Nazir's vendetta. The court heard she had previously met Nazir via a dating app and slept with him at an Airbnb in London's Kings Cross during a visit to the UK between December 2018 and January 2019, although it remains unclear how she came to be hired to carry out the shooting. Scoping out house On the day of the shooting, Betro - wearing a summer dress, hoodie and flip-flops - bought a second-hand Mercedes from a garage in Alum Rock under the name Becky Booth. When Mr Ali pulled up, she got out and fired the gun directly at him but it did not discharge, prompting him to jump back in his car and flee. West Midlands Police Bullets went through the windows of the house Betro initially fled the scene but returned by taxi just after midnight and fired three shots at the family home. Days later, Nazir followed and according to Betro, the pair rented a car and drove to Seattle "just for a road trip" with stops at an amusement park, Area 51 in Nevada, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The investigation to find Betro and bring her co-conspirators to justice not only spanned several years but was hampered by the pandemic and involved the FBI, National Crime Agency and two UK police forces. West Midlands Police Mohammed Aslam (left) and his son Mohammed Nazir were jailed in November From the start, Betro denied her involvement and told the trial it was "all just a terrible coincidence" that she was around the corner from the scene of the attempted assassination six minutes later. "I think [she] has had a somewhat problematic relationship with the truth in not accepting what she was accused of." Asked if he believed Betro was paid or had acted out of loyalty to her partner Nazir, the officer said: "We've not seen evidence of payments.

Article: The choice of Alaska — a territory the United States purchased from the Russian Empire 158 years ago — for talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is being seen as symbolic by some Russian commentators who are framing it as a nod to historic ties and a chance for closer relations in future. It appears that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not been invited to the summit about the war in his homeland and representatives from Europe have also been excluded, fueling Kyiv’s worst fears that its future might be decided without its input. added that it seemed “quite logical for our delegation to simply fly across the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held specifically in Alaska.” Russian Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov also called the location “very wise,” in an interview on Tuesday with the state-owned news channel Russia24. He added that it was “very far from Ukraine,” which is around 5,000 miles away of Alaska and “very far from, unfortunately, Europe, which is now largely hostile to us.” Russian commentators also praised the choice of Alaska. Among them is Alexander Bobrov, who in an editorial for the state-controlled Russian broadcaster RT on Monday, wrote the summit was “more than just a meeting between two leaders,” and a “return to the logic of direct dialogue without intermediaries.” St. Felipe Sanchez / Alamy file The summit in Alaska — where Russian Orthodox churches still dot the landscape and place names like Nikolaevsk and Voznesensk speak to their shared history — could help build ties across the Bering Strait, which separates the two countries, Bobrov said. “Alaska’s story began as Russian, continued as American — and now has the chance to become a shared chapter, if both sides choose to see it as an opportunity rather than a threat,” he added, referring to Russia's sale of Alaska to the U.S. Ukraine's Zelenskyy said Saturday that any decisions taken without Ukraine were “decisions against peace,” adding, “They will not achieve anything.” The train station and a Christian Orthodox church lie in ruins after Russian bombing in Kostyantynivka, Ukraine, on Monday. Pierre Crom / Getty Images Asked Monday if the Ukrainian president was invited to the Alaska summit Trump said Zelenskyy “wasn’t a part of it” and while he had participated in numerous meetings during the course of the war, little had come of them. European leaders meanwhile, are set to hold a videoconference on Wednesday to to coordinate negotiations to end the war ahead of a separate call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a spokesperson for the German government told Reuters on Tuesday. Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, a joint statement by European Union leaders on Sunday welcomed Trump’s efforts “towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” but stressed that “a path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.

Article: Still unclear as the week unfolds: how visible and aggressive the federal presence in Washington would be, how it could play out, who will be targeted — and how long it might last. WASHINGTON (AP) — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation’s capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city’s police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city. “We could contest that,” she said of Trump’s definition of a crime emergency, “but his authority is pretty broad.” Bowser made a reference to Trump’s “so-called emergency” and concluded: “I’m going to work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster.” The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we’re going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump’s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL’s Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. READ MORE: Trump wants the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians to restore their old names She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington’s youth curfew, Chapman said Trump’s latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It’s just about power.” Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. “That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington’s police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. “That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. is ending and ending today.” The action fits a presidential pattern Trump’s declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office: He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer.” In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore.” Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.

Article: The United States and China have extended their tariff deadline for another 90 days, preventing an escalation of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, with markets rallying after President Donald Trump announced the pause. With the extension, the imposition of higher tariffs on China will be suspended until November 10, with all other elements of an existing truce – which was set to expire on Tuesday – to remain in place. “The United States continues to have discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns,” Trump’s executive order stated, using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a parallel pause on extra tariffs early on Tuesday, with the state media reporting that “a measure to further implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state” would provide stability for the global economy. From early April until then, US import levies on Chinese goods stood at 145 percent, while Chinese tariffs on US exports were 125 percent – rates that resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. Advertisement But the tariff truce agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland, lowered the temperature by temporarily slashing US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent, while Chinese levies on US exports fell to 10 percent. In recent weeks, US-China negotiations have been on a parallel track to other talks Washington has held with trade partners, as it moved to implement sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs – as well as industry-specific levies – on August 7. For Thomas Sampson, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, trade negotiations between the US and China have “been running on their own track … because the US sees China as a long-term economic rival.” Sampson told Al Jazeera that “I don’t think it [Washington] sees the EU or other countries in the same way.” He also noted that the “incipient military rivalry between the US and China” means that bilateral negotiations are sensitive. Flows of rare earth magnets – used in everything from clean energy technology to military hardware – from China to the US rose to 353 tonnes in June, up from just 46 tonnes in May. “Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance told Fox News in an interview. This week’s tariff pause may clear the path for Trump to meet President Xi Jinping in late October, when the president is expected to travel to South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the US, economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods has not been fully felt, as many firms have built up their stockpiles of inventories to mitigate the higher duties. For Thomas Sampson, “the tariff pause allows them [the US and China] to maintain the status quo, and it wouldn’t be surprising if, after 90 days, they extend it further.” More broadly, however, he believes that “there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington to push for a de-linking with trade from China.” “Big picture,” he said, “even under a different president, I think you’d still see tensions in the US-China relationship.”

Article: “[Unnamed criminals] fought back against law enforcement last night and they’re not going to be fighting back long because I’ve instructed them and told them whatever happens, you know, they love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform,” Trump said. And I said, ‘You tell them, you spit and we hit,’ and they can hit real hard.” There was, however, a rather obvious problem with Trump’s chest-thumping rhetoric: For all of his apparent concerns for officers, the president maintained very different standards when it came to Jan. 6 rioters, many of whom did far more than just spit on police officers during violent clashes at the Capitol, but who nevertheless received presidential pardons from the Republican just hours after his second inaugural. After this news came to public light, Trump’s DOJ, instead of firing the guy, said about the man who advocated deadly violence against cops, “Jared Wise is a valued member of the Justice Department and we appreciate his contributions to our team.” At the same White House press conference on Monday, the president went on to say that those who “so much as touch” key national landmarks in D.C. will “go to jail for 10 years.” Putting aside the simple fact that Trump can’t simply dictate criminal punishments on the fly, many were also quick to note that the Republican adopted very different standards after Jan. About a month ago during a briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declared from her podium, “This administration wants anyone who has ever committed a crime to be held accountable.” That certainly sounded nice, but it wasn’t long before observers took note of the inconvenient fact that Trump keeps pardoning criminals — including violent felons who attacked police officers on Jan. Customs and Border Protection used its social media platform to issue a statement that read, “Let this be clear: Anyone who assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer or agent in the performance of their duties will be arrested and swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Attack a cop, and life long consequences will follow!” FBI Director Kash Patel added in a statement of his own: “Hit a cop, you’re going to jail.” Such sentiments obviously should’ve applied to Jan.

Article: The hidden costs of cutting Medicaid Amr Bo Shanab/Getty Images With the passage of the big Republican tax and spending bil l, the federal government is poised to reduce support for Medicaid and the insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. But FQHCs rely on Medicaid patients as their primary source of revenue , and use grant funding from the federal government to cover the costs of providing care to the uninsured. Even with grants amounting to $5.6 billion in 2023 , FQHCs operate on razor-thin margins , and declining Medicaid enrollment following the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated their financial strain. While concern over rural hospital closures led to an additional $50 billion being allocated to a " Rural Health Transformation Program ," an analysis by KFF estimates that this only offsets one-third of the lost revenue from the Medicaid cuts. A paper by economists Craig Garthwaite, Tal Gross, and Matthew Notowidigdo argues that hospitals act as "insurers of last resort." When policy makers cut Medicaid enrollment, hospitals ultimately bear the cost. According to MACPAC (the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission), hospitals provided $22.5 billion worth of uncompensated care to uninsured individuals in 2021, for a total of nearly $40 billion spent on charity care and bad debt (or, around 5 to 6% of hospital expenses). Sponsor Message Medical debt So far, we've found that increasing the uninsured population places financial burdens on two important parts of the social safety net: community health clinics and nonprofit hospitals. Poor health makes us all poorer Being uninsured is, understandably, bad for your health: the uninsured receive less preventative care , have greater difficulty obtaining prescription drugs and dental care, and are less likely to get the specialty care they need.

Article: The Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people formed in Colombia in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and from environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining Banners on the side of the road for the Dagoberto Ramos armed group are displayed on July 18, 2025, in Caldono, Colombia. Elago and five fellow members of the Indigenous Guard trekked across mountainous terrain to confront the guerrillas they suspected of taking her son and another teenager to bolster their ranks. “It was a victory.” Rescue missions like Elago's have intensified for the Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people, which formed in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining. Since 2020, as armed groups tightened their control of Nasa territory to expand illicit crops like marijuana and coca, those guerrillas have ramped up their recruitment of the region's children by dangling offers of cash and protection. Over eight days reporting in the Cauca region, the AP spoke to more than 20 young people affected by the recruitment as well as several families grappling with the same threat. Yet more than 40 Guard members have been slain since the peace deal, according to Colombia’s Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), a longstanding organization representing Nasa and other Indigenous communities. “They’ve aimed their rifles at us … pressed them to our chests, to our heads.” Elago said the rebels her group confronted three years ago expressed respect for the Guard but claimed the boys had joined voluntarily, which infuriated her. They met with commanders, only to find the 15- and 16-year-old boys did not want to return and were considered by the armed groups to be old enough to decide for themselves. Colombia’s Family Welfare Institute, or ICBF — the main agency protecting children — told AP it funds community programs and Indigenous‑led initiatives that have contributed to 251 children leaving armed groups in the first half of 2025. Her small school in the village of Manuelico — reachable only by a winding road from Caldono — is surrounded by dense forest and coca fields planted and patrolled by armed groups. One young woman who recently fled FARC dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she joined the armed group at 16 not because she was forced but to escape family problems. As for the parents, she said: “I tell families they need to build trust with their children." Fernández, a woman in her mid-30s who asked to be identified only by her last name for fear of reprisals, was 12 when armed men came looking for her in her rural Cauca community.

Article: The heavily indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande, is set to be delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange on August 25 HONG KONG -- The severely indebted real estate developer China Evergrande, already in the process of liquidation, said on Tuesday it will be delisted from Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Aug. Evergrande was the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, with over $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders, when the court handed down a liquidation order in January 2024. “All shareholders, investors and potential investors of the company should note that after the last listing date, whilst the share certificates of the shares will remain valid, the shares will not be listed on, and will not be tradeable on the Stock Exchange," the statement said. The Hong Kong court system has been dealing with liquidation petitions against some Chinese property developers, including one of the largest Chinese real estate companies, Country Garden, which is expected to have another hearing in January. The liquidators said they have assumed control of over 100 companies within the group and entities under their direct management control with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. About $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization “modest." Of this amount, $244 million was derived from subsidiaries’ assets, and not all of them will be available to the company, given the complex ownership structures of the assets. In 2024, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a fine of 4.2 billion yuan (about $584 million) against the firm's subsidiary, Hengda Real Estate Group Company, over violations including falsifying financial records. Chinese authorities in September 2024 banned the accounting firm PwC for six months and fined the company more than 400 million yuan ($56.4 million) over its involvement in the audit of the collapsed property developer.

If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: A six-year-old Palestinian boy and a 30-year-old man have died from malnutrition, the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza has said, as hunger-related deaths climb and Israeli bombardment continues across the besieged territory. The deaths of Wissam Abu Mohsen and young Jamal Fadi al-Najjar on Tuesday came shortly after Gaza’s Health Ministry said five more people had died of famine within 24 hours, bringing the total number of starvation-related fatalities since the start of Israel’s war to 227, including more than 100 children.. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday urged Israel to allow it to stock medical supplies in Gaza before the military proceeds with its plan to seize Gaza City, a move that has drawn international condemnation. “We want to stock up, and we all hear about ‘more humanitarian supplies are allowed in’, well it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative in the Palestinian territories. “We call on the government of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating.” Israel attacks ‘safe zones’, rescue workers At least 67 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Tuesday, hospital sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera. “A family of four, the al-Nadeem family, has been targeted and a young girl has been rescued, but there are many people trapped under the rubble.” Rescue operations have also come under fire. Footage verified by Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on central Gaza City, with a stream of blood running down the street as people carried a wounded man to a vehicle. Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said Israeli bombardment of Gaza City has intensified for three consecutive days, using “all types of weapons … bombs, drones and also highly explosive munitions that cause massive destruction to civilian homes”. Israel ‘blocking’ food items Israel is also blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into Gaza, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Tuesday. It added that Israel had directly targeted food sources, by not just preventing aid, but deliberately bombing 44 food banks, killing dozens of workers in them, and targeting “57 food distribution centres with bombardment”. Earlier, the Office accused Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the military body reporting on aid deliveries into the enclave, of “a pathetic attempt to cover up an internationally documented crime, the systematic starvation of the population of the Gaza Strip”. This comes a day after Israel targeted and killed a team of Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza City – an attack that has sparked protests in countries across the world. Since May 27, when Israel and the United States introduced the new GHF food distribution system in Gaza, 1,838 Palestinians seeking aid have been killed and more than 13,409 wounded, the ministry said.

Article: WASHINGTON — Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.” The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Frittata brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion. White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS. ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window. The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.” The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC’s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. Every time we win, everybody wins.” Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth. There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. Wherever we ended up, that’s what we’re going to roll with.” White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.

Article: Mahmud Bassal, a spokesman, said the residential areas of Zeitoun and Sabra had for three days been hit by bombs and drone strikes that "cause massive destruction to civilian homes", with residents unable to recover the dead and injured. The joint statement also demanded an end to the use of lethal force near aid distribution sites and lorry convoys, where the UN says more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by the Israeli military. Separately, the World Health Organisation on Tuesday appealed to Israel to let it stock medical supplies to deal with a "catastrophic" health situation before it seizes control of Gaza City. "We all hear about 'more humanitarian supplies are allowed in' - well it's not happening yet, or it's happening at a way too low a pace," said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative in the Palestinian territories. We need to be able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in." Israel's war cabinet voted on Monday to occupy Gaza City, a move condemned at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council later that day. He also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid in Gaza, including designating safe corridors for aid distribution, as well as more air drops by Israeli forces and other partners. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said that 100 dead had been brought to hospitals across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including 31 people who were killed at aid sites. On Tuesday members of an international group of former leaders known as "The Elders" for the first time called the war in Gaza an "unfolding genocide" and blamed Israel for causing famine among its population. Following a visit to the Gaza border, Helen Clark and Mary Robinson, a former prime minister of New Zealand and a former president of Ireland, said in a joint statement: "What we saw and heard underlines our personal conviction that there is not only an unfolding, human-caused famine in Gaza.

Article: Madonna urges Pope to visit Gaza 'before it's too late' 14 minutes ago Share Save Paul Glynn Culture reporter Share Save Getty Images Madonna released her remix album Veronica Electronica last month Madonna has urged Pope Leo XIV to visit Gaza and bring his "light to the children before it is too late". The US queen of pop shared her plea on social media, saying the supreme pontiff was "the only one of us who cannot be denied entry." Her intervention came as the UK, EU, Australia, Canada and Japan issued a statement saying "famine is unfolding in front of our eyes" and urged action to "reverse starvation". "You are the only one of us who cannot be denied entry." The Like a Prayer singer added: "We need the humanitarian gates to be fully opened to save these innocent children." She signed off by saying: "There is no more time. Love, Madonna." In July, the new Pope renewed his call for a Gaza ceasefire after three people sheltering in the Catholic church in Gaza City were killed in an Israeli strike. According to PA News, he said: "I appeal to the international community to observe humanitarian law and respect the obligation to protect civilians as well as the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force, and the forced displacement of populations." Reuters Pope Leo XIV became the first US head of the Catholic Church in May Madonna - who last month released her long-rumoured remix album Veronica Electronica - has made impassioned speeches on stage about Gaza since the war began. This includes while performing at London's O2 in 2023, when she told fans: "It breaks my heart to see children suffering, teenagers suffering, elderly people suffering - all of it is heartbreaking, I'm sure you agree. "But even though our hearts are broken our spirits cannot be broken." She urged fans to bring "light and love" into the world - both individually and collectively, via words and actions - in order to "bring peace to the Middle East" and beyond. In the caption of her latest online post, she noted how it was her son Rocco's birthday and "the best gift I can give to him as a mother - is to ask everyone to do what they can to help save the innocent children caught in the crossfire in Gaza." The star, who also asked for donations to three different organisations, continued: "I am not pointing fingers, placing blame or taking sides. I pray that they are released as well." U2's solidarity statement Madonna's comments come as U2 frontman Bono - along with the rest of his bandmates - also released a statement letting fans know where they stand on the matter. While condemning the actions of both Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas, the Irish frontman offered: "Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood.

Article: Indeed, to hear the administration tell it, there’s a “public safety crisis” and “public safety emergency” in the District of Columbia, which is reflected in crime in the nation’s capital that is “rising” and “out of control.” The rationale was nonsensical: Crime rates are down across the board in D.C., and violent crime rates have reached a 30-year low. For that matter, at his rambling White House press conference, Trump referenced a handful of other cities by name as if they’d all descended into “Mad Max”-style hellscapes, despite the fact that crime rates have already improved in each of the cities he referenced. President Trump’s decision to send at least 800 National Guard troops into the streets of Washington to fight crime is the latest example of how the president has used the military to advance domestic policy priorities. Americans have, after all, already seen Trump deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles — a spectacularly unnecessary move that proved a debacle in a variety of ways — which roughly coincided with the president deciding to use U.S.

Article: Reports by the French news channel RFI put the number of arrested soldiers at at least 50 while the Reuters news agency reported 36 to 40 soldiers have been detained. Abass Dembele, a former military governor of the northern region of Mopti, was arrested on Sunday morning in his home in Kati, a garrison town just outside Bamako, according to RFI. He was active in the northern war of 2012, a civil war that broke out after Tuareg separatists parlayed with armed groups to seize more than 60 percent of the country. Since 2012, Mali’s army has battled a swarm of armed groups in the north, including Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in the greater Sahara (ISGS). RFI quoted an unnamed Malian senior military officer close to the government as saying the soldiers were arrested because “they wanted to destabilise the transition,” referring to the military government, which calls itself a transitional government that is expected eventually to hand over power to a civilian administration.

Goita’s government, for example, approved a bill in July that would allow him to seek a five-year presidential mandate, renewable “as many times as necessary” and without requiring an election. This month, former Prime Minister Moussa Mara was arrested and charged with “undermining the credibility of the state” after he visited political prisoners and posted about seeking justice for them. “As long as the night lasts, the sun will obviously appear!” Mara had written on July 4 in a social media post, adding: “We will fight by all means for this to happen as soon as possible!” Choguel Maiga, who was the prime minister until his ouster in November, has also accused Goita’s government of targeting him. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are also military led, banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) this year after they withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States.They also created a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations to try to drive out armed groups. Although there were peace agreements made after the 2012 war that allowed the northern region of Kidal to maintain a semiautonomous nature, the military government under Goita has torn up the peace deals and returned to fighting, forcing hundreds of people to flee across the border to Mauritania.

Article: A key measure of underlying inflation rose in July as President Trump’s tariffs intensified price pressures across a wider range of consumer goods and services, although the overall increase was likely not significant enough to deter the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates at its next meeting in September. The July data, which was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, provides a clear sign that businesses are more readily passing along tariff-related costs to their customers after a prolonged period in which price gains were muted. companies that import products have largely been able to hold off on raising prices despite a universal 10 percent tariff that has been in place on all imports since April, along with higher levies on steel, aluminum and products from China and Canada. A vacancy unexpectedly opened up at the start of the month when Adriana Kugler, a governor, announced that she was leaving before her term was set to expire at the end of January. Miran, who still must be confirmed by the Senate, will join a group of Fed officials who have started to splinter over the right time to restart interest rate cuts that were paused in December.

"There are clear signs a range of goods prices are moving higher, pushing core goods inflation to a more than two-year high, but some major tariffed items, including autos and major appliances, have yet to show much impact," Pearce wrote. Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" that the CPI data shows "no evidence whatsoever" that tariffs have fueled higher consumer prices.

Article: Take a look at fed rate cut expectations for the final three meetings of the year relative to where they were on Monday — based on interest rates futures data from the CME Group's FedWatch tool: September: 91.8% chance vs. Take a look at what strategists and investors around Wall Street are saying: Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-CIO of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management: "The Fed is getting the data support that the tariff effect on price level will mostly be transitory. Tariffs have yet to drive substantial price increases, as companies continue to offset cost pressures by drawing down inventories and adjusting prices cautiously due to perceived consumer price sensitivity … In essence, this inflation print supports the narrative of an insurance rate cut in September, which will be a key driving force for the markets." Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital: "Tuesday's CPI data was tame enough that it gives the Federal Reserve the green light to cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September and opens the possibility of a larger 50 basis point cut in September. This data, coupled with the weak July employment report from earlier this month, puts the nail in the coffin for lower interest rates." Josh Jamner, senior investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments: "CPI data that was in-line with expectations will not change the outlook for a September rate cut which was already largely priced into markets, but should provide a boost to risk assets with equities higher and interest rates lower as traders unwind hedges they had put in place to protect against the risk of an upside surprise in the data, which failed to materialize." Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Not as bad as we thought, but I mean, still, this is going to complicate the work of the Fed a bit." Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management: "In this environment stocks can continue to move higher and it is going to take a much larger inflation number – or other shock to the market – for a correction to commence. With many strategists expecting volatility in the months ahead, yet recommending that dips should be bought, it's hard to envision a very large pullback absent an actual recession." Daniel Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity at Janus Henderson Investors: "The July CPI report came in broadly in line with expectations, reinforcing the view that inflation is under control, even if not quite at target. The headline print was contained by falling energy and gasoline prices, while services remained the primary driver of the overall increase." Peter Boockvar, CIO at One Point BFG Wealth Partners: "Both Treasurys and the S & P futures are breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn't higher than expected but 3.1% y/o/y core CPI is still well above 2%. I know some on the Fed and one new member joining temporarily seem to be very confident on how the economic data will play out over the next 4 months but I'm much less confident as the tariff impact will continue to flow through the data and I must say, many service companies too are feeling the higher cost of goods prices, it's not just manufacturers." — CNBC's Sarah Min and Alex Harring contributed reporting.

Article: The move, Ron says, is based on his belief that the era of autonomous big rigs on the roads at scale is here, with the freight industry to be transformed by the economics of driverless technology in the semi cab. The region was chosen as the first area of the nation to deploy the technology at scale due to the massive amount of freight that travels in the Sun Belt, from states including Texas and Arizona to California, and the lack of severe weather conditions like snow and ice (removing one variable for the autonomous technology to navigate). Ron grew Uber Freight to a $5 billion annual revenue business over the past decade, working with one-third of Fortune 500 shippers, according to the company, and managing close to $20 billion in freight overall for clients including Colgate, Nestle, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. The ties between Ron and Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun (the two executives have known each other for a decade) — and between Waabi and Uber — are longstanding. Uber is a major investor in her company, and Uber Freight has been a key partner in testing Waabi's autonomous trucking technology on the roads, with a program underway in Texas since 2023 and an existing goal of deploying across billions of miles. "Over the last four years, we've focused on the product development and R&D, and now we're entering the commercialization phase," said Urtasun, who added that Ron will be focused on the "go-to-market strategy, foundational partnerships such as Uber Freight that push the company to the next level, new partnerships, and positioning the business to scale. Now, he added, "It's about the people who buy the trucks." Ron expects a relatively fast adoption cycle — among both logistics firms looking to replenish freight fleets and shippers, such as major retailers, with their own trucking assets and operations.

Article: US President Donald Trump said he is deploying 800 National Guard soldiers to Washington, DC, and taking control of its police department after claiming that crime was “out of control” in the capital city. The nation’s capital is “becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,” Trump said at an August 11 news conference as he invoked the Home Rule Act to take federal control of the city. “Washington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world, and we’re going to make it that.” But many of the details Trump cited do not stand up to scrutiny. In a news briefing after Trump’s announcement, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the district would cooperate with the federal government and added that she speaks with Trump often about the city’s progress on crime. The executive order says federal use of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order; protect federal buildings and monuments; and ensure “conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.” Trump delegated operational control of the department to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.” Advertisement A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.” Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings. This year, through August 9, there have been 188 carjackings compared with 299 during the same time period in 2024, and compared with 607 in 2023, a police spokesperson told PolitiFact. The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25 percent drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year. “Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster … Somebody murders somebody, and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” “No cash bail” or “cashless bail” allows certain defendants awaiting trial to be released from custody without paying bail. The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that supports reducing the prison population, measured public safety before and after pretrial reforms in four states and nine cities and counties, including Washington, DC. The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6 percent — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system. A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days”.

Article: Russian forces may have punched a small but significant hole through Ukraine’s front lines, Kyiv-supporting military analysts warned Tuesday, a development that could give Vladimir Putin a boost ahead of his Alaska summit with President Donald Trump. Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments. Already claiming he is winning this war, and refusing to stop fighting unless Ukraine surrenders, Putin could use such a development to lobby for an even more favorable peace deal in Alaska. Evgeniy Maloletka / AP Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with Finland’s Black Bird Group, which tracks the conflict, told NBC News that if the Russians do break through and consolidate, “it could be very bad for the Ukrainians.” This push may have been timed ahead of the Putin-Trump summit, he added. “The Russians have had a tendency to intensify military operations in support of ongoing negotiations so the current events would fit into that picture quite well,” Paroinen said, adding that “we don’t have enough information yet” to be sure. A Ukrainian military spokesperson told NBC News that breakthroughs were being made only by small groups of Russian “infiltrators” — who are being quickly found and “destroyed” by its defending troops — rather than larger units capable of taking and controlling territory. “Of course, the situation there is and remains difficult, and the fighting in this region is the most intense compared to other sections of the front line,” he told NBC News. “However, the Ukrainian troops are making every effort to ensure that even those groups of Russians who managed to infiltrate through the first line are destroyed as soon as possible — which is what happens.” The severity of the situation was made clear by the 1st Azov Corps — seen as among the most adept fighters Ukraine has — announcing Tuesday it had been deployed to the region.

READ MORE: This sculpture at the UN is covered in more trash each day as nations work toward ending plastic pollution Most were from organizations that are part of the Break Free From Plastic movement. “We’ve invested a lot into coming all the way to Geneva, away from our communities, away from our families, because we understand how important an issue this is and how crucial a moment this is,” said Juressa Lee, who is from New Zealand and was representing the Aotearoa Plastic Pollution Alliance. “Civil society leaders from around the world, together with those most impacted, are speaking with a unified voice that we need to show courage, not compromise, and fix the process.” The head of Panama’s delegation to the talks, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, cheered them on as he walked by. Are they standing for them, their citizens, or big oil?” The biggest issue is whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse. “Because if there is no production, there’s no treaty.” Magnus Heunicke, the Danish environment minister, and Jessika Roswall, the European commissioner for the environment, held a news conference to stress the European Union is in Geneva to get a legally binding, international agreement on how plastic is produced, consumed and disposed. It is not, however, up to the EU.” WATCH: New study highlights ‘grave, growing’ danger of plastic pollution to world’s health Heunicke didn’t specify what they would do if plastic production isn’t in the treaty, since the negotiations are ongoing.

Article: The program, called Fanatics ONE, will offer members points for purchases across the company's various businesses, which now include its sports merchandise business, collectibles, and trading cards, as well as casino and sportsbook operations. Tucker Kain, Fanatics' chief strategy and growth officer, said this new loyalty program highlights the company's expansion beyond merchandise, and "the opportunity to bring [it] together from a consumer and experience perspective." Kain said that Fanatics has roughly 10 million people already in its FanCash program, which it previously rewarded to customers who bought merchandise through its ecommerce platform and its app. Fanatics has a vision of building FanCash into "the currency of sport," Kain said, where fans will be able to acquire not just a new jersey or hat, but tickets, athlete meet-and-greets, access to Super Bowl parties, or Fanatics Fest, the company's effort to build a Comic-Con-like event for sports that recently held its second edition. Part of that speaks to the depth of Fanatics' relationships across the sports industry that it has forged since Michael Rubin founded the company, a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, in 2011. It also speaks to the company's growth as it has expanded beyond merchandise into trading cards, collectibles and sports betting, with Fanatics earning more than $8 billion in revenue in 2024. Still, the bulk of the company's revenue comes from its core merchandise business, and this new loyalty program will look to expose more sports gear shoppers to what Fanatics has been doing in collectibles and betting.

Article: But even that level of sustained pickup in deals, he said, "is going to feel like a very busy market after the past few years." Kennedy, whose firm specializes in IPO research, says what he expects from IPO market in the near-term is a possible "return to normalcy" rather than a repeat of the Covid-era IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 — the "crazy levels," as he put it on this week's CNBC "ETF Edge," when there was a burst of deals which saw far too many pre-profit companies go public through not just IPOs but a wave of SPAC offerings. Since the April 8 stock market low fueled by fears about President Trump's trade war, the Renaissance IPO ETF has posted a return of nearly 50%, close to doubling the return of the S&P 500 Index . Investors may need to wait at least a few more years until they get a crack at OpenAI as a public company, according to Renaissance Capital senior strategist Matt Kennedy, but investors who bought into the AI-led IPO market of 2025 have booked big gains already. According to Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, the big gap between the IPO market returns since April and the stock market reflects the broader risk of sentiment, "and what you see is when animal spirits are high, it's typically good for IPOs," he said on "ETF Edge." He pointed to two of the most notable deals from the AI and crypto space: Coreweave and Circle . It has helped the ETF industry too, according to Geraci, with a "monster year" for inflows into spot crypto ETFs — $26 billion in all, with bitcoin ETFs taking in $19 billion and ether ETFs taking in $7 billion. Circle had given back a good deal of its gains since going public, but was still up roughly 50% this year before it reported earnings on Tuesday morning, which led to a new surge in the company's stock price. "There's a saying on Wall Street that when ducks are quacking, feed them, so Circle really accelerated the timeline of a lot of crypto companies waiting to go public," he added. Kennedy said there are plenty of other crypto companies that could follow with offerings, including Grayscale and Gemini, which have both filed for offerings, as well as Kraken, which is rumored to be considering an IPO, and Ripple. He said the current environment, in which AI companies just need to declare themselves open for business to get a billion-dollar valuation is "just crazy," but he added that it will be a "good thing in the long run" for a sustained flow of IPOs in the years ahead. While Kennedy said an OpenAI IPO might not arrive until 2028-2029, there are more than just the biggest-name companies going public that have an AI theme embedded in their business, such as design firm Figma and medtech company Heartflow .

Article: Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and agent accused of sabotaging $240M Hawaii real estate project A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development. A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development. A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all - celebrity or not." Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. It called Ohtani "Japan's Babe Ruth" and the "1st Resident," giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, "one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii," Hapuna Beach, "rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler" and two golf courses - one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. "He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training." The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and "as part of a bold marketing strategy" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, "one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable." "This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project," the investment brochure said. "We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives." The suit said Balelo "quickly became a disruptive force," threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. "Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with (Ohtani) than honoring its obligations to its business partners." Last month, in what the suit called "a coordinated ambush," Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

Article: On Monday, Trump — surrounded by heads of the Defense, Justice and Interior Departments as well as the FBI director — vowed to crack down on criminals and unhoused people living in the nation's capital. "Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people," Trump said as he announced a plan to send in the National Guard and take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for at least the next 30 days. Sponsor Message In an interview with Morning Edition, Schwalb called Trump's move "unprecedented" and said his office was watching closely to ensure the Home Rule Act and constitutional law are being followed. Schwalb spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about the takeover and what legal options his office and residents have if they feel policing becomes unlawful under Trump, who said officers will be able to do "whatever the hell they want." This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Schwalb: So I'm very concerned and my office and I are taking a close look at the very question you're asking about operational control, because even under the Home Rule Act, which gives the president some limited authority, command and control over the police department is not divested from the mayor and the chief of police. The law passed by Congress, the Home Rule Act, provides that the president, under limited special circumstances of an emergency, can request the services of MPD for a federal purpose. And we are watching very closely the facts on the ground as to whether or not Chief [Pamela] Smith, as she said yesterday, is in control of MPD and making command and control decisions for the force. And we're watching very carefully as to whether this is going to change the operations of MPD, because even under the limited authority that the President has under the Home Rule Act, he does not have the authority to take over MPD. Schwalb: I'm concerned about a statement like that, because even when MPD, under the limited circumstances of Section 740 of the Home Rule Act — and by the way, this is totally unprecedented in the history of our city. Our MPD is a professional law enforcement agency committed to professional constitutional policing, and that has to remain, even if the limited circumstances of a Section 740 invocation are in place.

Article: Trump's Washington, DC, takeover begins as National Guard troops arrive Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday. Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called - without substantiation - a lawless city. Still unclear as the week unfolds: how visible and aggressive the federal presence in Washington would be, how it could play out, who will be targeted - and how long it might last. "We could contest that," she said of Trump's definition of a crime emergency, "but his authority is pretty broad." Bowser made a reference to Trump's "so-called emergency" and concluded: "I'm going to work every day to make sure it's not a complete disaster." The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that "we're going to take our capital back," Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of "over policing our youth" with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move "is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power." Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. "That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia." Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington's police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. "That should alarm everyone," she said, "not just in Washington." For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. is ending and ending today." The action fits a presidential pattern Trump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office: He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. "We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer." In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro - standing next to Trump - called his takeover "the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore."

Article: 'We had too much drama' - meet the Real Housewives of London 14 minutes ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save Real Housewives of London Karen Loderick-Peace, Juliet Mayhew, Panthea Parker, Juliet Angus, Nessie Welschinger and Amanda Cronin are the cast of the Real Housewives of London The Real Housewives franchise has spread around the world, with viewers lapping up the partying and catfighting of wealthy socialites in locations from Orange County to Sydney to Nairobi. For Cronin and her five co-stars - Juliet Angus, Karen Loderick-Peace, Juliet Mayhew, Panthea Parker, and Nessie Welschinger - it's just one of the many dramatic moments as the international franchise arrives in the city. Speaking in a West End hotel, Cronin laughs about how quickly the insult went viral and stands by the fact that her co-star Angus, an American socialite who also appeared in Ladies of London, should be banished from SW3. Getty Images Juliet Angus was sent packing to Paddington in a teaser clip for the show Cronin says she "didn't hesitate" when she was asked to be on the show. "It's just a massive opportunity and such a blessing - to be a housewife is huge so I grabbed it and ran with it." Parker, an Iranian-born north London socialite, admits she had her doubts about joining, but didn't want to live with the regret of turning down such a big franchise. Cronin says: "The producers came to my room one day and said 'You're too strong, your blows are too low and there was too much drama'." Parker adds that producers told her they were doing her a favour by cutting out parts of an argument in the first episode. Getty Images Angus says there wasn't enough drama in 2014 reality TV series Ladies of London Perhaps the reason for so much friction is the fact that the group of six women weren't friends before the show. You just have to own it and life is about making mistakes, rising up, brushing yourself off and starting all over again." The group grew closer "because we spend so much time together filming", she adds. We even got to know each other better than how we know some of our closest friends." Getty Images The Real Housewives of Orange County was the first series in the franchise Before stepping in front of the cameras, the London housewives sought advice from women who had previously been in their positions. Loderick-Peace adds that several existing housewives told her the most important thing was to "just be yourself" - and all the London cast insist they have put their authentic selves on screen. Getty Images Karen has previously appeared on The Real Housewives of Cheshire and Jersey UK Most of the housewives are no strangers to reality TV, and as a result tend to forget the cameras are rolling after a while. Then he was regretting it, but I said he was giving himself too much importance and it was probably only going to be two seconds." Cronin and Loderick-Peace's children chose not to appear, but Welschinger says her whole family, particularly her husband, enjoyed the experience. "I think it was because the production team made you feel safe and they know what they're doing so you can trust the process." Getty Images Amanda Cronin previously dated Wham!

The New York Times reported that the White House’s trade tariffs have “intensified price pressures across a wider range of consumer goods and services.” From the article: The Consumer Price Index stayed steady at 2.7 percent compared to the same time last year. Two weeks ago, for example, the Republican sat down with New York Post columnist Miranda Devine and made a rather specific claim — not only about the key economic issue, but about his perceived successes. “Prices are way down for everything — groceries, everything.” But grocery prices are up, not down, and inflation obviously hasn’t been “taken care of.” Indeed, the latest BLS data isn’t the only relevant piece of evidence. Soon after, the Commerce Department reported the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — a metric that’s closely watched by the Federal Reserve for evidence of inflation — is also climbing, and as The New York Times reported, the data represented “the latest sign that President Trump’s tariffs are starting to bleed through into consumer prices.” It’s something to consider the next time he pretends he pushed inflation “way down.” This post updates our related earlier coverage.

Article: “Washington, D.C., should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world, and we’re going to make it that.” President Donald Trump said he is deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department. READ MORE: The nation’s capital finds itself at the center of a Trump maelstrom as National Guard troops arrive In a news briefing after Trump’s announcement, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said the district would cooperate with the federal government and added that she speaks with Trump often about the city’s progress on crime. The executive order says federal use of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order; protect federal buildings and monuments; and ensure “conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.” Trump delegated operational control of the department to U.S. Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.” A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.” Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings. The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25% drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year. “Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said.

The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6% — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system. A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days.” However, once reversed, the return to cash bail did not affect the number of rearrests.

CREC ascribes to a strict version of Reformed theology — rooted in the tradition of 16th-century Protestant reformer John Calvin — that puts a heavy emphasis on an all-powerful God who has dominion over all of society. Wilson and CREC are also strongly influenced by a 20th-century Reformed movement called Christian Reconstructionism, according to Julie Ingersoll, a religion professor at the University of North Florida who wrote about it in her 2015 book “Building God’s Kingdom.” WATCH: Bondi launches taskforce on ‘anti-Christian policies’ in government and regulations She sees that theology reflected in the Wilson slogan Hegseth repeated on social media. The ministry has a robust media presence, including Canon Press, publisher of books like “The Case for Christian Nationalism” and “It’s Good to Be a Man: A Handbook for Godly Masculinity.” What is the connection to Christian nationalism? Among them are evangelicals who view Trump, a Republican, as a champion, some of whom are influenced by Christian Reconstructionist ideas; a charismatic movement that sees politics as part of a larger spiritual war; and a Catholic postliberal movement envisioning a muscular government promoting traditional morality.

Article: A federal appeals court on Tuesday allowed teams affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency to gain access to potentially sensitive data on millions of Americans, overruling a lower court that had blocked that access in February. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the access to data stored at the Treasury Department, the Education Department and the Office of Personnel Management, citing the Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case in June involving Social Security data. Writing for the majority, Judge Richardson said the circumstances of the case mirrored those in a lawsuit involving data that the Supreme Court had weighed as an emergency application this year. In an unsigned order in that case, the Supreme Court intervened to allow the DOGE analysts to continue sifting through the records “in order for those members to do their work.”

Article: While Trump's memorandum said the mobilization would end once he determines that the "conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia," the troops were notified they would be deployed until Sept. “Currently, the National Guard is being deployed to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence," a White House official said Monday. Standing alongside Trump as he announced his executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that people should expect to see the guardsmen "flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week" and that they were prepared to bring in other specialized units. Trump's memorandum also directed Hegseth to coordinate with governors across the country and "authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission." In an interview with NBC News, Greggory Pemberton, chairman of the D.C. Pemberton said one of the main reasons local law enforcement "can't get a handle on the crime" is because of a staffing shortage of more than 800 officer vacancies and because of laws the city council enacted "that really prevent us from being able to do our job and being able to hold criminals accountable." "As a short-term, stop-gap measure, if they want to give us 1,000 National Guardsmen and 500 federal agents to help us do our job, we’ll take it," he said. "We’ll take anything we can to try to keep these criminals from victimizing citizens." Pemberton said he is concerned that if longer-term changes aren't made, once federal agents and National Guard troops leave D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department "will be left holding the bag, which will only allow crime to again, you know, regain its foothold and start growing it again." The reactions from Washingtonians to Trump's moves to take over the city were mixed. neighborhood near where guardsmen are mobilizing, told NBC News Tuesday that she agrees with Trump that the city has a crime problem, but she also doubted a short-term surge in law enforcement and the military presence would provide a sufficient fix. Attorney’s Office need to do more to prosecute those who commit crimes and hand down swift punishments that will serve as a deterrent — including holding young people, who she said are a major part of the problem, accountable. Violent crime in the district has decreased by 26% over the last year, according to Metropolitan Police Department statistics, though crime overall has gone down by only 7% during that same period.

Bowser met Tuesday with Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is overseeing the effort, and several other top Justice Department officials.

One of the two drivers had been in the country for two hours and had been driving for 15 minutes before the car was seized, the Motor Insurers' Bureau said. Several of the seized vehicles had been brought to the UK from abroad, with drivers using motor insurance from their home countries without verifying whether the policy provided coverage in the UK, the organisation added.

Met Police Police seized 72 vehicles across the three day operation One driver who was stopped by police officers told BBC London: "Apparently the car came up without insurance on this registration. "On DVLA it wasn't automatically swapped from the original reg number to the personalised one, and my mistake was not to call the insurance and declare the new reg with them."

Article: Sponsor Message Nonetheless, Trump is authorized to deploy the National Guard and assume emergency control over the MPD under home rule, the form of limited self-governance that Congress granted D.C. A major change happened in 1871, when Congress consolidated multiple local jurisdictions into a single government with a typical territorial structure: a governor appointed by the president, an elected delegate in Congress and a two-chamber legislative assembly. "As that was happening there was a lot of pushback against Black governance and rising Black political participation." In 1874, a wary Congress implemented a new form of governance in D.C: a three-member, presidentially appointed commission. "The committees were sort of notoriously stacked with southern segregationists, so you had quite an antipathy for people who actually lived in the city, especially as the city became increasingly Black" starting in the 1940s, she says. George Derek Musgrove, an associate history professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the co-author of Chocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital, says residents were fed up with being governed by lawmakers from other parts of the country who didn't align with their interests. "And it's run by some of the most retrograde members of Congress in the entire institution." Advocates' efforts paid off: Congress voted to pass the Home Rule Act in 1973. Musgrove says the Cold War was also a factor: "The lack of democracy in the capital of the United States had become a tremendous embarrassment." While Congress was eager to offload some of the logistical responsibilities of running a city, he says, it was apprehensive about the prospect of a majority-Black local government and wanted to make sure the federal government could "serve as a backstop against anything in the city that they might find uncomfortable." That's why Congress left itself the power to overturn local legislation and dictate how D.C.

By 1995, D.C.'s deficit had grown to $722 million and Wall Street dropped its bond ratings to "junk" levels, leaving the city unable to pay its vendors or obtain a line of credit. Sponsor Message Then-Mayor Marion Barry — who served from 1979 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999 — recognized the level of financial disarray and asked the federal government to step in, says Shoenfeld. In 1995, Congress created a body called the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, known as the Control Board (other cities, like New York and Chicago, had their own during periods of financial instability). "The level of control that the Control Board insisted on exercising was not what [Barry] wanted and it sort of ended up being like a hostile takeover, ultimately, where they insisted on appointing the heads of every local agency," Shoenfeld says. It very much felt like an affront to the people of the city." The Control Board took controversial actions like abolishing the city's lottery board, firing the superintendent of schools, replacing the elected Board of Education with appointed trustees and firing hundreds of government workers. regain its financial footing, and by fiscal year 2001 it had balanced five consecutive budgets — allowing the Control Board to dissolve a year earlier than initially planned, according to a Brookings Institution history.

Members of the Police Department, the lawsuit said, had engaged in behavior that included “trapping protesters into spaces where they could not escape, beating protesters with batons and fists, throwing protesters to the ground, using pepper spray indiscriminately and ultimately arresting many of the protesters without lawful justification and without fair warning.”

(Philippine Coast Guard via AP) MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine military on Tuesday blamed China for the collision of two Chinese navy and coast guard ships while trying to drive the Philippine coast guard and fishermen from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. The United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, on Tuesday condemned the “latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel.” The Chinese coast guard on Monday blamed Philippine vessels for the confrontation and said it was forced to expel the vessels after they intruded into “China’s inherent territory,” despite warnings. Video footage made public by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy ship with the bow number 164 slamming into the bow of a Chinese coast guard ship while both try to block and force a Philippine patrol ship, the BRP Suluan, away from Scarborough. BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response. Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take “necessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.” The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told reporters in Manila that the video footage clearly showed that the Chinese navy ship maneuvered to ram the BRP Suluan, which had to move to avoid being hit. “We’ll discuss possible steps and our future tactics to counter China’s actions to stop us from getting access (to Scarborough)." Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner’s statement but Gan Yu insisted its forces would be “resolutely safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.” ___ Associated Press journalist Huizhong Wu contributed to this report.

(Jung Yeon-je/Pool Photo via AP) South Korea's former first lady Kim Keon Hee, wife of impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, arrives at a court to attend a hearing to review her arrest warrant requested by special prosecutors, in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. (Jung Yeon-je/Pool Photo via AP) SEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate. The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest. Kim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week’s questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as “someone insignificant.” Investigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company. Min’s investigation team arrested one of Kim’s close associates earlier Tuesday following his arrival from Vietnam, as they look into suspicions that he used his connection to the former first lady to secure millions of dollars in business investments for his financially struggling company. The investigators also raided a construction company on Monday over allegations that its chairman purchased a luxury necklace reportedly worth $43,000, which they believe was the same one Kim wore while accompanying Yoon on a 2022 trip to Europe. Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month following a March release and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, has repeatedly resisted investigators’ attempts to compel him to answer questions about his wife.

Article: Nvidia's market capitalization — its stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding — ended Monday at roughly $4.5 trillion, equal to about 8% of the S & P 500. That's the "biggest weight in the S & P 500 of any individual stock," in data going back to 1981 , according to Apollo Global Management's chief economist, Torsten Slok. Nearly nine out of every 10 analysts who cover Jensen Huang's company on Wall Street rate it a buy, and Nvidia now sells for 59 times its trailing 12-month earnings, according to FactSet data. "There's a reason the stock is up here, which is Nvidia continues to provide most of the most critical equipment for AI and the demand for AI usage," said D.A. "So, inferencing continues to rise as the models become ever so potent." NVDA 3M mountain NVDA, 3-month But there are two areas that could go wrong for Nvidia, according to Luria, who rates Nvidia a neutral and whose $135 price target implies that the stock will slide about 26% over the next year. It's safe to assume that a lot of their other sales are indirectly to China, either to Chinese companies domiciled otherwise, or sales to resellers that ultimately arrive in China. Wells Fargo said Nvidia can grow more than 20% as a result of the agreement, which Luria described as uncertain at the same time as it "probably bodes well for their ability to sell the B30 [chips] either later this year or at some point next year. "What most of their big customers are now talking about is that the chips aren't the bottleneck – it's the ability to have a data center on the power grid with HVAC equipment ready for chips that's holding them back," Luria added. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, told CNBC that, as the market leader, Nvidia may eventually face another challenge as a result of the AI boom: increasing competition. For instance, Amazon Web Services has been making efforts to rival Nvidia when it comes to AI infrastructure , saying earlier this year that it's looking to reduce training costs associated with AI and provide an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. "While they are riding an incredible and massive CapEx spending wave on the GenAI model [and] data center buildout, selling semis is still a very competitive and cyclical business," Boockvar said.

Article: It also focused on supporting ‘the Syrian government’s efforts to consolidate’ a ceasefire in the Druze-majority Syrian province of Suwayda, as Syria’s minority communities continue to express concerns for their safety. Foreign ministers from Syria and Jordan, as well as a United States envoy have met in Amman to discuss ways to support the rebuilding of Syria under its new government, as Damascus seeks investment deals with international companies to revive an economy battered by 14 years of civil war. Syria’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that its top diplomat Asaad al-Shaibani met with Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack to discuss “ways of strengthening cooperation and coordination between the three sides” to serve Syria’s stability, “sovereignty and regional security”. Damascus said the sides had agreed to form a working group “to support the Syrian government’s efforts to consolidate the ceasefire in [Suwayda] province, and work to find a comprehensive solution to the crisis”. His Majesty King Abdullah II, in a meeting with US Special Envoy for Syria and Ambassador to Türkiye Thomas Barrack attended by HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein, noted Washington’s key role in supporting Syria’s reconstruction in a way that preserves the rights of all Syrians #Jordan pic.twitter.com/QrtI0eybiQ — RHC (@RHCJO) August 12, 2025 The Jordanian-Syrian-American meeting was a continuation of discussions held between the officials in Amman on July 19 about deadly clashes in the Druze-majority Syrian province of Suwayda, where a week of sectarian violence killed 1,400 people before a ceasefire put an end to the bloodshed. Advertisement Syria’s minority communities have expressed concerns for their safety since December, when a lightning rebel offensive toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, who had projected himself as a protector of minority groups. While the new Syrian authorities have repeatedly stated their intent to protect all of the country’s ethnic and religious groups, the killing of more than 1,700 mostly Alawite civilians along the coast in March and the violence in Suwayda have brought the issue of sectarian tensions to the fore. Jordan expresses support for Syria’s reconstruction efforts Following Tuesday’s meeting, Syria, the US and Jordan released a joint statement regarding Suwayda, saying that it is “an integral part of the Syrian Arab Republic, and that the rights of its people are protected and preserved in the process of rebuilding the new Syria toward a secure and accomplished future for all citizens of the Syrian state, ensuring their representation and participation in building Syria’s future.” Jordan’s King Abdullah II separately met with al-Shaibani and Barrack, expressing his “support for Syria’s efforts to preserve its security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity”, said a statement from the Jordanian government. The king also said Jordan was ready “to share its expertise in all fields to help develop and strengthen the capabilities of Syrian institutions” and “noted the need to step up Jordanian-Syrian cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and preventing arms and drug smuggling”, the statement added. According to the Syrian statement, the foreign ministers’ meeting welcomed Damascus’s efforts to “restore basic services, hold perpetrators of violations to account, and prepare the conditions for the return of displaced people to their homes”. Syria’s new authorities have worked to attract investment for the reconstruction of infrastructure across the country after the United States and European Union lifted sanctions on Syria in the wake of al-Assad’s ouster. Damascus signed 12 agreements worth $14bn last week, including a $4bn agreement with Qatar’s UCC Holding to build a new airport and a $2bn deal to establish a subway in Damascus with the national investment corporation of the United Arab Emirates. Other major developments on the investment front include the $2bn Damascus Towers project for residential high-rises, signed with the Italian-based company UBAKO; a $500m deal for the Baramkeh Towers project, also in Damascus; and another $60m agreement for Baramkeh Mall.

Article: Ukraine’s military has sent reserves to stem Russian advances near two key cities in the eastern Donetsk region, as Moscow attempts to gain more territory before a meeting between its leader, Vladimir Putin and United States President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, where land swap issues to end the war will be focal. The Ukrainian General Staff said on Tuesday that its forces were involved in “difficult” fighting close to Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, with the extra soldiers needed to block attacks by small groups of Russian troops. The development suggests intensifying struggles in the eastern Donetsk area, where Moscow-backed separatists have mainly held sway since the conflict there erupted there 2014, instigated by the Kremlin and deepened by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s advance is one of the most dramatic in the past year, with its soldiers infiltrating 17km (10 miles) past Ukrainian lines over the last three days, according to Pasi Paroinen, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group. Moscow, which has further isolated the destroyed town of Kostiantynivka, one of the last remaining urban areas Ukraine holds in the Donetsk, hopes to encircle the nearby city of Pokrovsk. Ukraine’s DeepState blog, which has close connections to the Ukrainian military, described the situation as “quite chaotic”, as Russian troops are “infiltrating deeper, trying to quickly consolidate and accumulate forces for further advancement”. In the run-up to the talks, the EU said on Tuesday that it welcomed the US president’s efforts “towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, but emphasised that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and “international borders must not be changed by force.” Trump had earlier disappointed his European allies by saying that Ukraine and Russia would have to accept land swaps if peace is to be achieved.

Article: The two have clashed over interest rates: Trump has pushed for aggressive cuts, while Powell has maintained the bank will make a decision based on financial indicators, not political pressure. “I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.” The president’s attacks on Powell have become a source of concern for economic observers, who worry that Trump is attempting to undermine the independence of the central bank and bring it into closer alignment with his political priorities. The Federal Reserve is currently undergoing renovations on two of its historic buildings, both built in the 1930s, including asbestos removal, major structural work to meet modern safety standards, and the replacement of antiquated systems for ventilation, plumbing, electricity and fire detection. Advertisement “While periodic work has been done to keep these buildings occupiable, neither building has seen a comprehensive renovation since they were first constructed,” Powell wrote in a letter to the Trump administration on July 17. “Both buildings were in need of significant structural repairs and other updates to make the buildings safe, healthy, and effective places to work.” But while the renovation project was initially estimated to cost $1.9bn, that number has increased to around $2.5bn as construction proceeds. “Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board.” Powell and economic policymakers at the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, have expressed concern over Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, which they maintain could increase inflation in the coming months.

Article: China has announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports, a new escalation in the yearlong trade dispute that began with Ottawa’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports last August. China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday that an anti-dumping probe launched in September 2024 had found that Canada’s agricultural sector – particularly the canola industry – had benefitted from “substantial” government subsidies and preferential policies. Advertisement The decision marks a shift from the conciliatory tone struck in June when China Premier Li Qiang said there were no deep-seated conflicts of interest between the countries during a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The move provides an opportunity for Australia, which looks set to regain access to the Chinese market with a few test cargoes this year after a years-long freeze in the trade, Pay said. Australia, the second-largest canola exporter, has been shut out of the Chinese market since 2020 due mainly to Chinese rules to stop the spread of fungal plant disease called “blackleg”. However, even if Australian imports increase, “fully replacing Canadian canola will be very difficult unless import demand drops sharply,” said Donatas Jankauskas, an analyst with commodity data firm CM Navigator. “This is a gut punch no one was expecting.” Ventum Financial broker David Derwin said some traders do not know how to take the Chinese move yet, since it is not a final rule.

Article: WASHINGTON — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city. Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged to work alongside the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city's law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers. The tone was a shift the day before, when Bowser said Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn’t match the declining crime numbers. city government" to “make Washington, D.C., safe again." The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we're going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power.” Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. "That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington’s police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. “That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. is ending and ending today.” The action fits a presidential pattern Trump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office: He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer." In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore." ___ Associated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.

Article: No printers or PCs, Starbucks Korea tells customers 1 hour ago Share Save Faarea Masud BBC Business reporter Share Save Getty Images Starbucks customers in South Korea have been asked to stop bringing "bulky items" into cafes to do their office work, after some brought printers and desktop computers. As many people choose to work from home, cafes like Starbucks have been trying to strike the balance between being a casual coffee place and welcoming customers choosing to work there. "If you can't afford an office space and Starbucks is silly enough to let you run your office there for the price of their less-than-mediocre sugary caffeine beverage, go for it," said one user on Reddit. "Starbucks remains committed to being a welcoming third place for coffee and connection, and where community thrives in every cup, every conversation, and every visit", Starbucks concluded, though its mild-mannered response hides the derision many feel for those seen to be hogging seats at cafes. Starbucks's in South Korea move echoes sentiment in cafes across the world, including in England where some coffee shops have introduced policies aimed at stopping remote workers from "hogging" tables and limiting turnover.

Article: British soldiers using sex workers in Kenya despite ban, inquiry finds It was commissioned in October 2024 following an investigation by ITV into the behaviour of soldiers at Batuk, including allegations some army personnel were paying local women for sex. Soldiers at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) used sex workers "at a low or moderate" level, a report said, adding more work was needed to stamp out the practice. The ITV documentary followed previous concerns raised about Batuk after the death in 2012 of a local woman Agnes Wanjiru, allegedly killed by a British soldier stationed at the base. Since then a string of allegations have been made about the conduct of troops at the training site, which lies near the town of Nanyuki 200km (125 miles) north of Kenya's capital Nairobi. It notes that of those, 26 cases happened before training on the new rule was initiated for all army staff in November of that year, with nine reported cases since then. In addition to those detailed in the report, the Foreign Office told the BBC there was a small number - less than five - cases of alleged use of sex workers currently under investigation. The report said that despite the training given by the Army and the control measures in place, the reality was that "transactional sexual activity" by UK personnel in Kenya was still happening, and that "the level is somewhere between low and moderate". "It is not out of control, but the best way for the Army to manage the risk is for the Army to assume it may be at the upper end of that scale between low and moderate," the report added. The report noted efforts by the Army to stamp out the practice, including regular training and the use of "sharkwatch" patrols with a senior officer of Sargeant rank or above deployed to monitor the conduct of junior personnel when they left the base for nights out. The report follows years of controversy about the conduct of soldiers at Batuk sparked by an investigation by the Sunday Times in 2021 which revealed the alleged involvement of a British soldier in the murder of Ms Wanjiru, a mother of one whose body was found dumped in a septic tank near a hotel where she had been seen with soldiers on the night she vanished. Separately in Kenya, MPs have been conducting an inquiry into wider allegations of mistreatment of local people by soldiers at Batuk and have heard claims at public hearings of injuries allegedly sustained through the behaviour of British troops and of soldiers fathering children to Kenyan mothers and then abandoning them when they returned home. The Service Inquiry behind the latest report said it had spoken to many local Kenyans and found "the vast majority" of local residents were happy with the presence of the Batuk camp.

Article: Israel’s targeted killing of an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza over the weekend was noteworthy even for a conflict remarkably blood-soaked for journalists, leaving some experts to marvel that any news at all emerges from the territory. An Al Jazeera executive said Monday that it won’t back down from covering what is going on there and called for news organizations to step up and recruit more journalists. A total of 184 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israel in the Gaza war since its start in October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 7 AP dispatch vividly described the hunger faced by many in Gaza: “A single bowl of eggplant stewed in watery tomato juice must sustain Sally Muzhed’s family of six for the day. She calls it moussaka, but it’s a pale echo of the fragrant, lawyered, meat-and-vegetable dish that once filled Gaza’s kitchens with its aroma.” Other recent AP reports carried images and text reporting from the aftermath of an Israeli strike on Gaza’s only Catholic church, and a profile of an 18-year-old aspiring doctor now trying to survive sheltered in a tent. WATCH: Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Sharif and 4 other journalists killed by Israeli drone strike in Gaza Journalists from The Washington Post and the Guardian recently accompanied a Jordanian relief mission and took images of Gaza from the air, despite some restrictions from Israel. The Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo wrote: “Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient civilization, brought to light after centuries of darkness.” None of the organizations match the power and immediacy of Al Jazeera, however, in part because their correspondents have been in front of cameras. They’ve also paid the heaviest price: CPJ estimates that 11 journalists and media workers affiliated with AJ have been killed in the Gaza conflict, more than any other single organization. In a social media post written in June to be sent if he was killed, al-Sharif wrote that “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent.” In another posting on X on Aug. When I told you on air that it was an ‘indescribable scene,’ I was truly helpless in the face of this horrific sight.” Al Jazeera calls for other news organizations to come forward Salah Negm, news director at Al Jazeera English, said Monday it is very difficult to get people in to Gaza. “A lot of people in Gaza talk to us.” Many of the journalists working in Gaza are facing the same struggles to find food, for themselves and their families, as the people they are covering. Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said she’s concerned about the implications for journalists in future conflicts if what is happening in Gaza is allowed to continue without international condemnation that has real teeth. “They’re essentially admitting in public to what amounts to a war crime,” Ginsberg said, “and they can do that because none of the other attacks on journalists have had any consequences. It’s not surprising that it can act with this level of impunity because no international government has really taken it to task.” Given all that they face, “to me, the most remarkable thing is that journalists are continuing to cover (Gaza) at all,” she said.

Article: Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done,” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” The remarks came after Trump said a peace deal would involve swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides “to the betterment of both.” For Zelenskyy, such a deal would be disaster for his presidency and spark public outcry after more than three years of bloodshed and sacrifice by Ukrainians. A look at the challenges such proposals entail: Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine, from the country’s northeast to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed illegally in 2014. The front line is vast and cuts across six regions — the active front stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers (680 miles) — but if measured from along the border with Russia, it reaches as far as 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles). READ MORE: Trump suggests he’ll know if Putin wants a peace deal with Ukraine soon into their meeting Russia also partially controls more than half of the Kherson region, which is critical to maintain logistical flows of supplies coming in from the land corridor in neighboring Crimea, and also parts of the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Kremlin seized Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian forces are still active in the Kursk region inside Russia, but they barely hold any territory there, making it not as potent a bargaining chip as Kyiv’s leaders had probably hoped when they launched the daring incursion across the border last year. From a military standpoint, abandoning the Donetsk region in particular would vastly improve Russia’s ability to invade Ukraine again, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War. Bowing to such a demand would force Ukraine to abandon its “fortress belt,” the main defensive line in Donetsk since 2014, “with no guarantee that fighting will not resume,” the institute said in a recent report. Ukraine’s constitution poses a major challenge to any deal involving a land swap because it requires a nationwide referendum to approve changes to the country’s territorial borders, said Ihor Reiterovych, a politics professor in the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. “In the constitution it is written that only by referendum can changes to Ukraine’s territory be conducted.” If during negotiations Zelenskyy agrees to swap territory with Russia, “in the same minute he will be a criminal because he would be abandoning the main law that governs Ukraine,” Reiterovych said. Trump said he was “a little bothered” by Zelenskyy’s assertion over the weekend that he needed constitutional approval to cede to Russia the territory that it captured in its unprovoked invasion. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.” Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., brought a copy of her country’s constitution to her interview on Sunday with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and described how the president is “the guarantor of the constitution” and cannot give away land under Article 133. Along with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the partial occupation of Luhansk and Donetsk after that, it would require accepting that the Ukrainian military is not able to retake lost territories militarily.

Article: The United States Department of Justice has accused George Washington University of deliberate indifference to anti-Semitism, making the Washington, DC-based institution the latest to find itself in the crosshairs of the administration of President Donald Trump. “The Division finds that GWU took no meaningful action and was instead deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its Jewish and Israeli students and faculty,” the statement says. In a letter to the university, the Justice Department accused GWU of being “deliberately indifferent” to complaints it received from students and faculty, saying they failed to prevent or remedy abuses despite knowing of them. Dozens of universities may face investigation The Justice Department notice comes as the Trump administration has intensified pressure on institutions of higher education over allegations that they have allowed anti-Semitism to fester, particularly as pro-Palestinian protests and encampments spread across US university campuses in 2023 and 2024. In February, the Justice Department launched a federal task force to investigate allegations of anti-Semitism at 10 university campuses: Columbia University; George Washington University; Harvard University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.

Article: The consumer price index report (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over this time last year and follows a 2.7 percent increase in June, according to the Department of Labor report released on Tuesday. Increases and decreases “Today’s CPI report revealed that inflation beat market expectations once again and remains stable, underscoring President [Donald] Trump’s commitment to lower costs for American families and businesses,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to reporters. “We really are seeing a divergence in the inflation data right now between import-sensitive sectors and those that do not rely on imports,” Daniel Hornung, senior fellow at MIT and former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement Compared with this time last year, hotel prices fell by 1.3 percent and car rental prices tumbled by 2.9 percent as Americans have pulled back on discretionary travel spending. But products like tools and hardware prices ticked up 1.6 percent, car parts rose by 0.9 percent, and footwear surged 1.4 percent, all items that are imported and have to bear the levies. The latest data comes after Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, amid recently revised jobs data showing far fewer jobs were created than originally reported. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, but he has since appointed authors of many of its chapters to several key roles in the federal government, including Brenden Carr, who now leads the Federal Communications Commission and Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget. “It might last even longer because of the way that the tariffs are being put in place, where we’re seeing in April one set of tariff announcements that take a few months to work their way through into consumer prices. Then again, in August, another set of increased incremental tariff rates that will work their way through the system over the course of the fall.” In the private sector, some of the US’s largest businesses have announced a need to raise prices because of tariffs, including big box retailer Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker.

Article: Sherrod Brown has decided to run for the Senate next year in Ohio, according to three sources familiar with his plans, potentially putting the Republican-leaning state in play for Democrats. But a midterm year is typically tougher for the president's party, and Democrats have been aggressively recruiting Brown to run in the special election to serve the remainder of Vice President JD Vance’s Senate term against Sen. Democrats have two ripe targets in North Carolina and Maine, but they would then have to flip two GOP-held seats in states Trump won by double digits last year to take control of the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has traveled to Ohio twice in recent months, the latest visit coming in late June, a source familiar with the meeting, first reported by Axios, confirmed to NBC News. Brown's ability to overperform the national environment in a state that's been broadly trending away from Democrats is one reason they've been so bullish in trying to lure him into the race. Tyson Shepard, a spokesman for Husted’s campaign, said in a statement to NBC news: "Should Brown enter the race as Schumer’s handpicked candidate he will be starting in the biggest hole of his political career. Brown’s slogans will ring hollow as his coalition walks away, tired of the radical policies he’s forced to support to appease his coastal bosses in California and New York.” Brown, who had also been weighing a run for governor in Ohio, has been working to reorient his party, which, in his view, has lost its way among working-class voters. “But I lost in large part because the national reputation of the Democratic Party is that we are sort of a lighter version of a corporation — a corporate party. … It’s a good example of how workers get screwed.” A Senate run by Brown would also provide some clarity for Ohio Democrats as they look to fill out the rest of their statewide slate. Amy Acton, a Brown ally who has been running for governor for months, could ramp up her campaign without the nagging speculation that the former senator might enter the race and push her to the sidelines. Young Democratic mayors like Justin Bibb in Cleveland and Aftab Pureval in Cincinnati could concentrate fully on their uncomplicated 2025 re-election bids, free from the pressure to step up to a Senate race next year, though they could be courted for down-ballot contests.

Article: The Emil Bove-led effort failed to dismiss Adams’ corruption case in a way that would’ve let the administration hold the threat of reviving the prosecution over New York City’s mayor as political leverage. President Donald Trump subsequently appointed the Trump personal defense lawyer–turned–Trump DOJ lawyer to the federal bench, despite his unresolved ethical issues — so perhaps Bove sees the Adams case as a success, or at least benign.) More recently, another judge said “no” to the DOJ’s preferred ending to another criminal case, this one against Trevor Kirk in California. Kirk was a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who was found guilty by a federal jury in February of using excessive force when he assaulted and pepper-sprayed a woman outside a supermarket in 2023. According to DOJ’s news release in connection with the guilty verdict, while he was on top of the victim, Kirk used his police radio “to give a misleading report that he was in a ‘fight.’” But then, the Trump administration installed a new U.S. The office under Essayli moved to delay Kirk’s sentencing so the new top prosecutor could “review the facts and circumstances of this case.” The office then moved to reduce Kirk’s case from a felony to a misdemeanor and proposed a post-trial plea agreement that, if judicially approved, would give him probation. Essayli’s office then moved to fully dismiss the case — over objection of the victim, who observed that the government was “attempting to deploy a motion to dismiss to effectively overturn this Court’s prison sentence.” She said that “if the Government’s unprecedented maneuver works here, it will no doubt serve as a roadmap for other cases.” Wilson declined to allow the gambit. “Instead,” he went on, “the record shows that the Government brings this motion to overrule the Court’s sentencing decision.” The judge’s rebuke might not be the final twist in the story. On top of whatever happens on appeal, Wilson raised another prospect that’s all too real in the Trump era, where clemency is a routine part of the criminal justice process — or a way around it. In a footnote on the final page of his order, the judge wrote that his denial “does not leave the Government without options if it truly believes Defendant should not serve prison time. That power is ‘unlimited’ and, unlike Rule 48(a) [the procedural rule governing dismissals], is not subject to judicial review for whether it is contrary to the public interest.” With a prison surrender date set for later this month, we could soon learn whether Trump will exercise his pardon power or, if he doesn’t feel like sending a message of full vindication but wants to keep the lawman out of prison, commute Kirk’s sentence.

Article: “But now, due to the occupation forces, I hardly go out at all.” The family has lived in this yellow-plastered house for 40 years – longer than Azem has been alive. Unemployment soared over 30 percent, leaving Azem and his two brothers without regular work, and the family now relying solely on the income of Azem’s father, Wael, a taxi driver. Azem says the soldiers tried to frame him as an armed fighter, yelling questions at him like: “Why are you attacking us with Molotov cocktails?” The questions didn’t make sense to Azem, who says he has never engaged in violence. He says the soldiers then pushed him face-first into the ground, and one of them stepped on his head and asked: “Do you love Iran?” Azem said no, that he wasn’t political and that he doesn’t support Iran. “The video mocks us, the people of Palestine.” Though he took the video down quickly, others saw it, including Sebastia’s Mayor Mohammed Azem (no relation), who saved a copy as evidence of the soldiers’ mistreatment. Maha, Azem’s mother, speaks up: “When the Israeli soldier learned he was from Sebastia, they wanted to make this video to send a message to all of Sebastia, to say: ‘I’m here, and I control your village, and I do what I want to do here.’” “If he hadn’t said [what they commanded him to say], they could have hurt him worse, or killed him,” she adds. In the West Bank, soldiers near Hebron have allegedly drawn the Star of David on a Palestinian child’s book and branded the symbol on a man’s face in occupied East Jerusalem. “Israel employs a systematic strategy of humiliation to psychologically impact and break down Palestinian individuals and communities,” writes Ramy Abdu, chairman of the Swiss nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, comparing such acts of humiliation to those witnessed during World War II’s Kristallnacht. Increasingly, and especially since 2019, Jewish settlers have “attempted to impose a separation between the acropolis of the ancient site of Sebastia … and the village”, according to a report from Emek Shaveh, an Israeli archaeological NGO. Last month, it released a paper addressed to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, stating: “Israel’s attempt to appropriate the acropolis and sever it from the town undermines the historical integrity of the site … and violates the cultural rights of the town residents.” In response to Emek Shaveh’s objections, the Israeli military confirmed last year that establishing a military facility at the summit of the Sebastia archaeological site would involve frequent military incursions through the Palestinian town below. “The municipal employees, when they’re working in the street, they attack them.” There is no presence of Palestinian resistance fighters in Sebastia, and locals don’t have weapons to defend themselves, the mayor says. “When they pushed and attacked the girls, the Red Crescent came and took them to the hospital,” because locals can’t use their own cars for transportation to the hospital, for fear of Israeli military violence. These incursions and the intended bifurcation of the village are happening even though Israel is signatory to the First Protocol of the Hague Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from retaining cultural property in an occupied territory. Advertisement But Mayor Azem believes UNESCO has been slow to move forward partly because it doesn’t want to agitate the administration of US President Donald Trump, which has already put UNESCO participation under review due to so-called “anti-Israel sentiment”.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said that documents found at White’s home “expressed the shooter’s discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations” and that he wanted to make “the public aware of his discontent with the vaccine”. “This tragedy was not random and it compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured,” a union representing CDC employees, AFGE Local 2883, said in a statement on Monday.

Article: John Cornyn, is in the middle of the debate as one of the Democrats who are holed up in Illinois to deny Republicans the chance to move forward with a plan to net their party up to five more House seats in Washington. Democrats are hopeful that the energy around the redistricting fight, as well as fallout from the Cornyn-Paxton battle, could help them put the Senate race in the traditionally red state on the map. Matt Angle, a longtime Democratic strategist in Texas who runs the Lone Star Project, told NBC News that the redistricting battle has fired up the party’s “activist” base in the state. Talarico is a fresh face and he’s interesting, and Colin also shows a resoluteness and a competence that really plays to his strength." While O’Rourke and Talarico haven’t jumped into the race, their political operations have massively increased their digital spending on Meta platforms in recent days. O’Rourke — who previously ran for Senate and governor in Texas, as well as for president — has spent $380,000 since the state House Democrats announced their quorum break on Aug. There have only been five days within the past six years where O’Rourke has spent more than that $98,000 on Meta platforms dating back to mid-2019 — all were during the summer and fall of 2022, during his campaign against Gov. O’Rourke, who has become one of the more visible Democrats in the state after three high-profile bids for office, has been blanketing the airwaves for weeks, blasting the Texas redistricting plan and calling on national Democrats to “match fire with fire.” He’s also been raising funds for the Democratic lawmakers in the hopes of offsetting the steep financial penalties and other costs they’re facing. And so he comes to our state to grab even more power in the form of these five congressional districts,” O’Rourke said at a rally over the weekend in Fort Worth, one many he’s held in recent days in Texas and around the country. Paxton filed a lawsuit aimed at booting Talarico and a dozen other state legislators from office, while Abbott’s office posted a “wanted” poster of Talarico on its social media channels. Talarico, who had already made waves this summer with a high-profile appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast and other national interviews, has become a constant presence on television and done a slew of other media appearances since the quorum break began. Barbara Jordan, as well as more recent examples such as O’Rourke — Talarico said last week during an interview on The Ringer’s “Higher Learning” podcast that Democrats in the state know how to be bold. Everyone knows the Alamo, that is part of our DNA as Texans, it’s fighting for what we believe in, for standing up for what we believe is right regardless of the consequences,” he said. Later, Talarico took a swipe at Paxton and said that while he’s looking at the Senate race, he has been more focused on the redistricting fight and will decide “once we get past this quorum break and hopefully beat these corrupt maps.” Still, taking the Senate plunge would be a major step for Talarico, who has never had to build out a statewide fundraising or organizing operation before. As a former lawyer who worked on voting rights cases and a former congressman who initially defeated a Republican incumbent on his way to office, Allred has grounded much of his pitch on his own expertise. He has blasted Republicans for their comments that the redistricting plan is solely about accumulating more power in Washington and testifying against the plan in front of the state House. As Allred continues his run and Democrats wait to see what O’Rourke and Talarico decide, Angle lamented that his party may only get the chance to vote for one of these candidates in the general election.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has taken control of D.C.’s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation’s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are necessary to curb an urgent public safety crisis. Even as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the Republican president promised a “historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” His rhetoric echoed that used by conservatives going back decades who have denounced cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressives, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action. “But as far as (him) trying to get (the) homeless out of this city, that ain’t going to work.” “It’s like a band-aid to a gunshot wound,” said Melissa Velasquez, a commuter into D.C. “I feel like there’s been an increase of racial profiling and stuff, and so it’s concerning for individuals who are worried about how they might be perceived as they go about their day-to-day lives.” Uncertainty raises alarms According to White House officials, troops will be deployed to protect federal assets and facilitate a safe environment for law enforcement to make arrests. “The president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations — from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,” Hopkins said. A history of denigrating language Conservatives have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. President Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a “law and order” agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his “Southern Strategy.” Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from liberal cities for decades. Bowser kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference but decried Trump’s reasoning as a “so-called emergency,” saying residents “know that access to our democracy is tenuous.” Trump threatened to “take over” and “beautify” D.C. on the campaign trail and claimed it was “a nightmare of murder and crime.” He also argued the city was “horribly run” and said his team intended “to take it away from the mayor.” Trump on Monday repeated old comments about some of the nation’s largest cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland and his hometown of New York City. Trump’s rhetoric “paints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people’s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,” Wiley said. Leaders call the order an unjustified distraction Trump’s actions in Washington and comments about other major cities sent shock waves across the country, as other leaders prepare to respond to potential federal action. Wes Moore said in a statement that Trump’s plan “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous” and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump’s characterization of the city “fearmongering.” The administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in LA despite opposition from California Gov.

Article: Officials in Salt Lake City say three firefighters were hurt after a fire broke out in buildings that date back more than a century in the city’s nightlife hub SALT LAKE CITY -- Three firefighters were hurt after a fire broke out in century-old buildings in Salt Lake City’s nightlife hub, officials said Tuesday. One had a broken ankle, another was suffering from smoke inhalation, dehydration and nausea and the third was injured by falling debris and was briefly trapped against a chain link fence, Lieb said. Crews were pulled out of the building and were battling the blaze from outside because part of the building collapsed, Salt Lake City Fire Department Division Chief Bob Silverthorne said at an overnight briefing. The fire destroyed buildings that date back to 1920 and are “home to beloved local businesses and gathering places that bring life, culture, and connection to our community,” the Downtown Alliance said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that the effects will “ripple far beyond the walls of the impacted property.” The alliance, which represents 2,500 businesses and property owners in the central business district, said property owners have said that they intend to rebuild.

(Jennifer Sullivan via AP) BOSTON -- A manatee was recently spotted off the coast of Massachusetts for the first time in almost a decade and scientists want to monitor its condition to see if a rescue is necessary before it succumbs to the cold water or lack of food, they said Friday. The threatened species, which makes its habitat in warmer southern Gulf waters in places like Florida, was first seen July 26 off the southwestern coast of Cape Cod in the area of Nantucket Sound. She said on Monday that she found the manatee, which was as long and wide as her paddleboard, “just lazing around there in the grass going as slowly as possible.” “It was completely unfazed by us," said Sullivan, who went on to say she felt “just in awe of how graceful the creature was and to be so close in the wild to it.” A few days later, the animal was seen stranded on the tidal flats in Mattapoisett. “So it’s important to intervene as soon as it's sighted again to prevent health declines.” Lysiak said it's unclear how and why the manatee found its way so far north.

Article: Musk and Altman, who helped start OpenAI a decade ago with a group of other co-founders, had a public falling out that led to a legal fight last year, with Musk accusing Altman of breach of contract for abandoning the artificial intelligence company's founding mission. "Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote, without citing evidence. "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote in a post on X Monday night. Altman referenced a 2023 report from tech news site Platformer that described how Musk, after acquiring Twitter (now X), made sweeping platform changes and "created a special system for showing you all his tweets first." Altman said that if Musk ended up filing a suit, he hoped it would lead to "counter-discovery on this," adding that he and many others "would love to know what's been happening."

Article: State Department slashes its annual reports on human rights Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AP Mandel Ngan/AP The State Department released its long-awaited reports on international human rights Tuesday, and they drastically reduce the types of government repression and abuse that the United States under President Trump deems worthy of criticism. The new report on El Salvador drops references to poor prison conditions — simply saying in the executive summary, "There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses." The same blanket assurance appears in the executive summary for Hungary, and gone is extensive documentation of government corruption there. This year's release was delayed for months while the State Department spent additional time deleting thousands of violations from drafts prepared in 2024 by foreign service officers and their contacts abroad. Trump praised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is widely thought to have ordered the torture and assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying Saudi Arabia's success didn't come from western nationbuilders giving, "lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs."

Article: Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by US President Donald Trump have started arriving in the nation’s capital, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city’s police department and reduce crime in what the president called – without substantiation – a lawless city. The law lets Trump control the police department for a month, but how aggressive the federal presence will be and how it could play out remained open questions as the city’s mayor and police chief went to the Justice Department to meet with the attorney general. The meeting comes a day after Mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump’s freshly announced plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and call in the National Guard was not a productive step. “We could contest that,” she said of Trump’s definition of a crime emergency, “but his authority is pretty broad.” Bowser made a reference to Trump’s “so-called emergency” and concluded: “I’m going to work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster.” Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said Trump has accused Democrats of being “weak on crime”. Trump’s bumpy relationship with DC While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we’re going to take our capital back”, Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. “The White House says crime may be down, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a problem and that violent crime exists at levels that are far too high,” Halkett said. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in the summer of 2020. In Trump’s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasising common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the National Football League’s (NFL’s) Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington’s youth curfew, Chapman said Trump’s latest move “is not about creating a safer DC; it’s just about power”.

Putin and Donald Trump Putin met Trump met six times during the American’s first term -– at and on the sidelines of G20 and APEC gatherings — but most famously in Helsinki in July 2018. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Since Trump returned to the White House this year, he and Putin have had about a half-dozen publicly disclosed telephone conversations. They hosted each other for talks and informal meetings in Russia and the U.S., met regularly on the sidelines of international summits and forums, and boasted of improving ties between onetime rivals. After the first meeting with Putin in 2001, Bush said he “looked the man in the eye” and “found him very straightforward and trustworthy,” getting “a sense of his soul.” In 2002, they signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty -– a nuclear arms pact that significantly reduced both countries’ strategic nuclear warhead arsenal. He has called Bush “a decent person and a good friend,” adding that good relations with him helped find a way out of “the most acute and conflict situations.” Putin and Bill Clinton Bill Clinton traveled to Moscow in June 2000, less than a month after Putin was inaugurated as president for the first time in a tenure that has stretched to the present day. At a news conference the next day, Clinton said Russia under Putin “has the chance to build prosperity and strength, while safeguarding that freedom and the rule of law.” The two also met in July of that same year at the G8 summit in Japan, in September — at the Millennium Summit at the U.N. president reportedly said it was “interesting,” and, “I think yes,” but later backtracked and said it “wasn’t possible at the moment.” Putin used the anecdote to illustrate his point about the West’s hostility toward Russia, “a big country with its own opinion.” “We just realized that they are not waiting for us there, that’s all.

Article: BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — The Malian military government on Monday started returning home the historic manuscripts of Timbuktu, which were spirited out of their fabled northern city when it was occupied by al-Qaida-linked militants more than a decade ago. Islamic radicals destroyed more than 4,000 manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th century, after they seized Timbuktu in 2012, according to the findings of a United Nations expert mission. The majority of the documents dating back to the 13th century — more than 27,000 — were saved by the devotion of the Timbuktu library’s Malian custodians, who carried them out of the occupied city in rice sacks, on donkey carts, by motorcycle, by boat and four-wheel drive vehicles. The first batch of the manuscripts were brought to Timbuktu by plane from the capital of Bamako, authorities said, adding that the return was necessary to protect them from the threats of Bamako’s humidity.

He described them as as a “legacy that bears witness to the intellectual greatness and crossroads of civilization” of the city of Timbuktu — “a bridge between the past and the future.” “We now have a responsibility to protect, digitize, study, and promote these treasures so that they continue to enlighten Mali, Africa, and the world,” Kansaye said during Monday’s return ceremony.

Article: Nevada passed a similar set of restrictions on AI companies offering therapy services in June, while Utah also tightened regulations for AI use in mental health in May but stopped short of banning the use of AI. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The bans come as experts have raised alarms about the potential dangers of therapy with AI chatbots that haven’t been reviewed by regulators for safety and effectiveness. “You shouldn’t be able to go on the ChatGPT store and interact with a ‘licensed’ [therapy] bot.” But it remains to be seen how Illinois’ ban will work in practice, said Will Rinehart, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The law could be challenging to enforce, he said, depending on how authorities interpret its definition of therapy services: Will AI companies be able to comply by attaching disclaimers to their websites, or will any AI chatbot that describes itself as a therapist be subject to penalties? Advertisement Mario Treto Jr., the secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which will enforce the ban, declined to discuss specific examples but said he would look at “the letter of the law” in evaluating cases. Advertisement Advertisement Illinois’ bill says AI companies cannot provide or advertise “services provided to diagnose, treat, or improve an individual’s mental health or behavioral health” unless they are conducted by a licensed professional. Several platforms allow users to converse with customized AI chatbots tweaked to project a specific personality or demeanor — including “licensed therapists.” Some start-ups also market AI services specifically tailored for therapeutic purposes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advocates say AI services, especially those developed with therapy in mind, can be a helpful and always available remedy for those struggling to access professional help. A February study by University of California at Berkeley researchers found that chatbots can tend toward encouraging harmful behavior by users when asked, including recommending a hypothetical addict take methamphetamine. Vaile Wright, senior director for the office of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, said that’s “the opposite of what therapists do.” Advertisement “Therapists are validating, but it’s also our job to point out when somebody is engaging in unhealthy thoughts, feelings, behaviors and then help somebody challenge those and find better options,” Wright said. “What that means, fundamentally, is that a large portion of the economy is regulated to be human-centric.” “Allowing an AI service to exist is actually going to be, I think, a lot more difficult in practice than people imagine,” he added. Wright, of the American Psychological Association, said that even if states crack down on AI services advertising themselves as therapeutic tools, people are likely to continue turning to AI for emotional support.

Article: In late March, for example, Donald Trump signed an executive order that directly took aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, directing officials to eliminate “improper, divisive, or anti-American” ideology from the institution. Trump went on to characterize the Smithsonian as an institution that was “once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement” — before it fell victim to a nefarious ideology that the Republican considers “divisive.” All of this was ridiculous, but it was merely the first in a series of steps. A few months later, the president announced that he’d fired the director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, despite questions about whether he had the legal authority to do so. More recently, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History decided to alter an exhibit that referenced Trump’s impeachments — in ways that failed to fully reflect the truth — creating a brazen example of trying to rewrite history. Late last week, the museum restored information about the incumbent president to a display on presidential impeachments, but the new version wasn’t necessarily improved: It made changes to the original and removed some details. The Wall Street Journal reported: The White House plans to conduct a far-reaching review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America’s 250th anniversary to ensure the museums align with President Trump’s interpretation of American history. In a letter sent to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, three top White House officials said they want to ensure the museums’ ‘unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story’ and reflect the president’s executive order calling for ‘Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.’ The Journal’s report, which has been independently verified by NBC News, added that Team Trump intends to scrutinize everything “from public-facing exhibition text and online content to internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants.” The new letter to the Smithsonian Institution’s secretary, dated Aug. 12, added that this effort is intended to “restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” Of course, there’s no reason to believe that Americans have lost confidence in the Smithsonian, just as there’s no reason to believe the public will feel greater confidence in the museums after Team Trump advances its wildly unnecessary initiative. (The letter was signed by White House senior associate Lindsey Halligan, the director of the domestic policy council, Vince Haley, and the director of the office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought.) I’m mindful that Trump’s political allies often express discomfort when his critics accuse him of authoritarianism, but if Republicans want to discredit such concerns, perhaps White House officials shouldn’t tell museums that they’ll be reviewing exhibits to ensure the president’s ideology is reflected. The title of the White House’s order from March said the directive was intended to restore “sanity to American history.” Given the circumstances, “sanity” is not the word that comes to mind.

Article: KHAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani security forces have launched a “targeted operation” against militants in a restive northwestern district bordering Afghanistan, displacing tens of thousands of residents who fled to safer areas, officials said Tuesday. There was no formal announcement of the launch of the offensive in Bajaur, a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, but a government administrator, Saeed Ullah, said it was not a large-scale operation and only insurgent hideouts were being hit to avoid civilian casualties. On Tuesday, the provincial government in the northwest said it will give 50,000 rupees ($175) in compensation to each displaced family in Bajaur, where volunteers from the Al-Khidmat Foundation, a charity, were also seen distributing food among displaced families. Among those displaced is Gul Wali, 50, who said it was the second time that he had been forced to flee his home, as he sat in a government shelter, “although we have been told we will return to our village soon.” READ MORE: Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan and nearly 200 supporters sentenced over 2023 riots Wali said most homes in his village in the Mamund district were destroyed during the previous military offensive in 2009.

Article: The nonprofit group that manages Central Park on Tuesday formally asked New York City officials to ban horse-drawn carriages from the park, for the first time taking a public stance on an issue that has been politically contentious for years. The group, the Central Park Conservancy, said it was throwing its support behind Ryder’s Law, a pending City Council bill that would prohibit horse carriages from operating in the city, and urged Mayor Eric Adams and Adrienne Adams, the Council speaker, to support such a ban. Horse carriages have been a fixture of the Central Park landscape since the 19th century, and the conservancy’s opposition to their continued operation in the park could be a significant blow to the industry. “We do not take this position lightly,” Betsy Smith, the conservancy’s president, wrote in a letter to the mayor and Council speaker, “but with visitation to the park growing to record levels, we feel strongly that banning horse carriages has become a matter of public health and safety for park visitors.”

Improvement began hours after crews isolated the leak Monday night, though officials said Tuesday that they still have not reached the broken main, which is some 30 feet underground in Paterson. “We’re getting reports and we’re seeing on our own gauges that pressure is starting to come up in parts of the system.” The problems began Friday when the roughly 140-year-old water main broke. It’s just depressing.” The boil water order issued by the commission asks residents not to fill large jugs or containers, water lawns or open hydrants until at least Friday, and officials warned that the order may remain in effect until sometime next week.

Article: Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal that he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for copying an indigenous shoe design Sandals known as "huaraches" are displayed for sale at a market in Oaxaca, Mexico, Friday, Aug. (AP Photo/Luis Alberto Cruz) MEXICO CITY -- Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for imitating an Indigenous shoe design. Mexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag. In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote. “This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations.

Article: “It only saves the lives of Israeli soldiers.” He did not clarify what the Popular Forces would do exactly, but experts believe Israel is backing the militia and its leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, to put a Palestinian face on the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Abu Shabab emerges Abu Shabab, who leads the 100-man-strong Popular Forces militia, is an elementary school dropout, according to Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Despite this, he has a sophisticated and multilingual social media presence, and he recently penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming that Palestinians in Gaza were done with Hamas. He’s basically a front guy.” Advertisement His own tribe, the Tarabin, does not approve of his role in Gaza today, making a rare public statement disavowing him for allegedly collaborating with Israel. “His gang emerges a month later and becomes the main gang that loots the overwhelming majority of food and aid that’s going into Gaza systematically under [Israeli military] protection,” Shehada said. During the brief ceasefire that Israel unilaterally broke in March, Abu Shabab disappeared, only to reappear in mid-May when Israel, under immense international pressure, started to allow a trickle of aid back into Gaza. “He’s been the face of Israel’s hunger campaign,” Shehada said, “while giving Israel full deniability of it and outsourcing the thing.” A Palestinian face to ethnic cleansing Beyond the stealing of aid meant for starving Palestinians, analysts said Abu Shabab and his militia are contributing to a wider Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza, which has been intensifying this year. “Israel is in the process of trying to build up the militias associated with Abu Shabab in hopes that they can expand the concentration camp zones over which those militias can operate/control so that Israel can reduce the burden of occupation while facilitating the ethnic cleansing,” Tariq Kenney Shawa, the US policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian policy network, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement Abu Shabab’s militia has been building what analysts are calling concentration camps in southern Gaza, in an effort to drive more than half a million Palestinians there before being displaced to third countries. “The intention is to hold them there until an opportunity arises to send them elsewhere outside of Gaza, be that Egypt or any number of third countries,” Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said. “Israel understands that if the [Israeli army] operates a concentration camp in Rafah, it wouldn’t look very nice,” Shehada told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel would prefer “a Palestinian face that’s dressed in Palestinian uniforms with a Palestinian flag and speaking in Arabic” as the face of such an operation. In addition, he said, Abu Shabab has “two very well-oiled Facebook propaganda machineries” that could convince desperate people to seek shelter in his camps, “especially if Israel [begins] forcefully pushing people there.” “Abu Shabab’s militia is running smaller concentration camps within areas Israel controls and has advertised them as ‘safe havens’ for people to come get aid and set up tents and such,” Kenney Shawa said. But the GHF has been widely lambasted by aid groups and the UN for politicising aid, and Israeli soldiers shoot at hungry Palestinians every day as they try to secure aid for their families. Worsening the situation is that, instead of some 400 aid distribution points that the UNRWA used to operate in Gaza, the GHF has only four sites in the whole Gaza Strip.

Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Records show that the Clairton Coke Works facility has been cited for troubles containing combustible gases, racking up tens of millions of dollars in fines in the last few years, and has faced lawsuits from environmental groups. Advertisement In recent years, some facilities have been trying to move toward using less flammable gases to reduce the risk of explosions, but that push can also come with new problems, Baker said. The Clairton plant accounted for at least $57 million in fines, penalties and enforcement actions by the Allegheny County Health Department since 2020, according to an analysis by The Washington Post of data provided by the Breathe Project. According to Environmental Protection Agency data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group, the plant has been in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act for the past 12 quarters and has amassed more than $10.6 million in EPA penalties over the past five years. Steel more than $2.2 million after issuing an enforcement order against the plant because it had unsafe amounts of the flammable gas hydrogen sulfide in the air more for than 59 days in an 18-month stretch.

Article: A memorial dedicated to the 19 children and two adults murdered on May 24, 2022 during the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School is seen on May 24, 2023 in Uvalde, Texas. Two months before a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the school district's then-police chief was required to attend a training about how to respond to an active shooter, which instructed in no uncertain terms that an "officer's first priority is to move in and confront the attacker." When Pete Arredondo, the police chief of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District at the time of the May 2022 shooting, was confronted with precisely the situation his training should have prepared him for, he did the opposite of what the training instructed would have saved lives, according to a newly released trove of documents from the Uvalde school district. "The best hope that innocent victims have is that officers immediately move into action to isolate, distract, or neutralize the threat, even if that means one officer acting alone." More than three years after the shooting and the training designed to prevent it, Arredondo continues to fight a criminal case that alleges that he was responsible for putting students in danger by waiting 77 minutes to confront the gunman, who had holed up in adjoining fourth-grade classrooms. The records of the active shooter training were included in a trove of documents released by the Uvalde School District on Monday, following a years-long effort to withhold the documents about the school district's response, security, and police training. After years of requests from the families of victims, the public, and media organizations, including ABC News, the records were released on the eve of the new school year, as prosecutors prepare to bring two former school district police leaders, including Arredondo, to trial. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, said in a statement to ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." "I'm not sure if my battle for transparency will ever truly be over," said Gloria Cazares, the mother of 9-year-old Jackie Cazares, who was killed in the massacre. If we can't get justice, then the very least we deserve is every piece of evidence, every record, every truth that has been kept from us." Among the hundreds of pages released, the records suggest that the flawed response was not because of a lack of training, but in spite of it. The Texas state legislature passed a law in 2019 that required school resource officers and police to participate in an approved active shooting training within 180 days of their employment. "A first responder unwilling to place the lives of the innocent above their own safety should consider another career field." The training also includes material about the flaws in the emergency response to the February 2018 deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where officers faced criticism for staging outside the building while the shooting took place. According to the materials, the training in Texas was mandated to prevent a similar tragedy from taking place, where a delayed law enforcement response could potentially contribute to additional casualties. The 18-year-old student was disciplined for inappropriate behavior at least 18 times between 2015 and 2018, including bullying other classmates, using inappropriate and sexual language, and fighting his peers, the documents say. Speaking to ABC News after the shooting, Reyes said her son could be "aggressive" but he was not a "monster." "We all have a rage, that some people have it more than others," Reyes said In November of 2015, a disciplinary write-up noted Ramos wrote "I'm gay" on the back of another student's artwork planning sheet, according to the documents. Also that March, he was written up for "'using sexual language' after repeatedly [being] told to stop." When told to do his work by a teacher, the documents say he flashed the "L" loser sign and was placed under in-school suspension.

Article: The Food and Drug Administration is weighing revoking its authorization of Pfizer 's Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children under the age of 5, the drugmaker confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. While Covid typically causes mild symptoms in most children, others, such as infants under 1 or those with certain health conditions, can be at a higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Pfizer said it has requested the authorization to remain in place for the upcoming fall and winter season and is "currently in discussions with the agency on potential paths forward."

Article: Investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia is at least in part responsible for a recent hack of the computer system that manages federal court documents, including highly sensitive records that might contain information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes, according to several people briefed on the breach. It is not clear what entity is responsible, whether an arm of Russian intelligence might be behind the intrusion or if other countries were also involved, which some of the people familiar with the matter described as a yearslong effort to infiltrate the system. Administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records,” according to an internal department memo and reviewed by The New York Times.

Article: A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, sending a potentially record surge of flooding toward parts of Juneau in what has become an annual concern for residents FILE - A canoe, bottom right, glides on Mendenhall Lake, in front of the Mendenhall Glacier, on Sunday, May 18, 2025, in Juneau, Alaska. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File) A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream. The Mendenhall Glacier — a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska — acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. But 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city’s engineering and public works department. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Authorities at Benito Juarez International Airport said on Tuesday that all runways were operating again by midday, after all flights were suspended for at least four hours earlier that day.

Article: WASHINGTON — A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island’s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants’ misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.” Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training." The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable." “This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project," the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani’s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.” The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with (Ohtani) than honoring its obligations to its business partners.” Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-appeals-court-economy-great-depression-rcna224525
Article: On Monday, the Justice Department basically copied and pasted a hysterical plea from Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, in which the president claimed the country would experience another Great Depression if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirms and enforces a May decision from a Court of International Trade panel that found many of Trump’s tariffs on foreign countries were illegal. In a letter to the court, Solicitor General John Sauer and Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate argued that even if the judges agree that some of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, they should hold off on enforcing its decision while the administration appeals to the Supreme Court. One year ago, the United States was a dead country, and now, because of the trillions of dollars being paid by countries that have so badly abused us, America is a strong, financially viable, and respected country again. If the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect. In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hard-working Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened. The country, of course, wasn’t “dead” a year ago — though it has teetered on the brink of recession under Trump and continues to suffer the impact of his protectionist agenda. There’s also no guarantee that Trump’s trade agreements will ever bring in trillions of dollars, in part because, as my colleague Steve Benen recently noted, it’s still an open question whether some of the agreements are even legally binding or enforceable. And it’s certainly rich for Trump’s DOJ to warn about purported threats to jobs, Medicare and Social Security when his administration has gutted the federal workforce and he recently signed a budget that includes massive cuts to Medicare and Social Security benefits. To the contrary, many American consumers and companies would probably breathe a sigh of relief if they were freed from the dictatorial whim of their wannabe king and the tariff-induced taxes effectively placed on various goods.

Article: President Donald Trump’s Monday press conference painted a gruesome picture of a crime-ridden Washington, D.C., as he ordered the National Guard deployed in the city and laid out his plans to “rescue our nation’s capitol from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” But official data gives us a much different picture. Philadelphia recorded the fewest murders seen in the city since 1969, Baltimore since 1965, Detroit since 1964, and San Francisco had the fewest ever recorded (monthly data available to 1960). And it doesn’t reflect a recent change in national immigration policy; the decline began in 2023, so the main drivers likely began to take shape when immigration was at its peak. When trying to account for all of the factors, the most compelling explanation to me, as someone who works in crime data, could be most eloquently summed up as “we spent a lot of money on a lot of stuff.” For example, local and state government construction surged in the wake of the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act. The city’s murder count was cut in half by the end of 2024 and New Orleans recorded the fewest murders through June since 1970, in spite of the terrorist attack on Jan. A stable city budget and money from the federal and state governments enabled local street construction to surge by 180% between 2020 and 2024, helped along by new infrastructure construction related to the city’s hosting of this year’s Super Bowl. The Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office launched an extensive place-based violence reduction program called N.O.D.I.C.E., which uses a technique called Risk Terrain Modeling to identify “vulnerable areas” and deliver resources. From a traditional law enforcement standpoint, NOPD launched a joint task force with various federal entities while the state police deployed a task force of roughly 20 officers starting in mid-2024. Criminologists still aren’t sure why murder fell so precipitously in the 1990s, so we don’t know precisely which of these steps taken in New Orleans have been most important in driving down gun violence and other crimes. But intensive investment in communities like New Orleans in the wake of the pandemic — spurring construction, economic stability and innovative municipal programming — stands out as a strong explanation for much of the decline.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine will not withdraw from the Donbas Zelenskyy said Putin wants the remaining 9,000 square kilometers (3,500 square miles) of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control, where the war’s toughest battles are grinding on, as part of a ceasefire plan, in a press briefing on Tuesday in Kyiv. READ MORE: Trump suggests he’ll know if Putin wants a peace deal with Ukraine soon into their meeting Zelenskyy learned of Russia’s position after holding a call with Trump and special envoy Steve Witkoff, after the latter’s bilateral meeting with Putin. The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Their leaders said Tuesday they “welcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.” But, they underlined, “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and “international borders must not be changed by force.” The Europeans on Wednesday will make a fresh attempt to rally Trump to Ukraine’s cause at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is Putin’s closest ally in Europe and has tried to block EU support for Ukraine, was the only one of the bloc’s 27 leaders who refused to endorse it. The region’s Ukrainian military command on social media Monday acknowledged that the situation remains “difficult, unpleasant and dynamic.” Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile attack on a military training facility left one soldier dead and 11 others wounded, the Ukrainian Ground Forces posted on social media.

"They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else," the president wrote. "I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution." Trump did not name the economist he wants Solomon to replace. But Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist since 2011, warned in a research note on Sunday that American consumers will end up absorbing an increasing share of the cost of Trump's tariffs. "Our estimates imply that US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June but that their share will likely rise to 67% by October if the later tariffs have the same impact over time as the earliest tariffs," Hatzius and other Goldman researchers wrote.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article The White House is conducting an expansive review of the Smithsonian's museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America’s 250th anniversary to ensure it aligns with President Donald Trump's views of history, an administration official confirmed to NBC News. The assessment, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will include reviews of museum exhibitions, online content, internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants, and wording related to museum exhibit messaging, the official said. “This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the administration official quoted the letter as saying. The official said the review is aimed at making sure the museums reflect the “unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story” and reflect the president’s executive order calling for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” That order, which was signed on March 27, calls for removing "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. "The Smithsonian museums and exhibits should be accurate, patriotic, and enlightening—ensuring they remain places of learning, wonder, and national pride for generations to come.” The impeachment exhibition at The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, on Aug.

Among those items were Harriet Tubman’s book of hymns filled with gospels that she is believed to have sung as she led enslaved people to freedom through the underground railroad, and the “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,” the memoir by one of the most important leaders in the abolition movement. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History also recently made headlines after it removed a placard referring to Trump from an impeachment exhibit, sparking concerns over his influence on the cultural institution. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.” “[W]e will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness –- igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans,” the order said.

Article: The current version of the bill would give power to the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) to "require the appropriate municipality or county to install, maintain, and operate one or more outdoor warning sirens." The TWDB would only be able to do this after determining that an area "has a history of consistent or severe flooding." The board would consider several factors including "previous loss of human life to flooding" in the area and "the potential damage to real or personal property" in the area. The bill states, "The board ’s determinations under this section on whether an area requires an outdoor warning siren are final and binding." If a county or city already had an acceptable siren system in place, they would not be required to change it. Bettencourt also spoke to Upper Guadalupe River Authority President Bill Rector about sirens during that hearing and Rector said "there is no question that that could save lives." The current version of SB2 would require the governor's office to establish and administer the grant program that would pay for the siren warning systems. "Having the governor's office be involved in it is not doing anything except keep the accelerator pedal down on making sure the projects get done as quickly as possible," Bettencourt said.

Meanwhile Moscow's troops have continued their summer offensive, making a sudden thrust near the eastern Ukrainian town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. Moscow now holds almost all of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk but speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would reject any proposal to leave the Donbas. "If we withdraw from the Donbas today - our fortifications, our terrain, the heights we control - we will clearly open a bridgehead for the Russians to prepare an offensive," he said. Last week Trump said there would be "some swapping of territories to the betterment of both" Russia and Ukraine - sparking concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Moscow could be allowed to redraw Ukraine's borders by force.

Article: The document, previously seen as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government, significantly reduces criticism of some US allies such as Israel and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and South Africa. The language used echoes previous criticism by the Trump administration and some US tech bosses who oppose online harm reduction laws in some European countries, portraying them as attacks on free speech. Uzra Zeya, a former senior state department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, accused the Trump administration of "gutting" decades of highly respected work on human rights protections and an "abandonment of core values" to the US. "It sends a signal that there's going to be a free pass from the United States government, that it will look the other way if a government is willing to cut deals or do the bidding of this administration," she told the BBC. It follows internal guidance issued by political leaders earlier this year reportedly advising staff to shorten the reports to remove some references to issues including corruption and gender-based crimes, and follows some executive orders on related issues issued by President Trump. During a visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year Trump berated "Western interventionists" and said the US would no longer be "giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs".

Article: As he seeks to boost his campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo is proposing an overhaul to New York City’s rent laws and escalating his attacks on the frontrunner, Zohran Mamdani NEW YORK -- Andrew Cuomo is demanding that his opponent in New York City's mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, vacate his rent stabilized apartment, while pushing a longshot proposal that would bar other middle-class renters from accessing much of the city’s housing. “I am calling on you to move out immediately,” Cuomo wrote in a widely-viewed social media post this weekend, casting Mamdani as “a very rich person” occupying an apartment that could otherwise be used by a homeless family. The line of attack drew tens of millions of views online and revived a long-standing debate about who should have access to New York’s highly sought-after rent stabilized units, which make up roughly 40% of the city’s rental stock and are currently open to people of all incomes. It also illustrated the rhetorical lengths that Cuomo is willing to go to as he mounts an independent bid for mayor against Mamdani, a democratic socialist who defeated him handily in the Democratic primary on a platform that centered on affordability and freezing rent on stabilized units. Mamdani, who earns $143,000 annually as a state legislator, has said he pays $2,300 per month for a one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife — a living situation that Cuomo called “disgusting.” By contrast, Cuomo, a multimillionaire who previously served as the state's governor, spends roughly $8,000 monthly on an apartment in Midtown Manhattan that he moved to last year from Westchester County, a wealthy suburb. In recent weeks, the 67-year-old Cuomo has adopted a more aggressive social media presence, earning both praise and mockery for his use of millennial internet-speak and repeated references to his opponent’s “privilege.” Mamdani’s mother is a successful independent filmmaker and his father is a Columbia University professor. On Monday, Cuomo went a step further, releasing a formal proposal, which he dubbed “Zohran’s Law,” barring landlords from leasing vacant rent stabilized units to “wealthy tenants,” defined as those who would pay less than 30% of their income toward the existing rent. The rent regulation program, which caps how much landlords can raise rent each year on roughly 1 million apartments, does not currently include any income restrictions — something opponents have long pushed to change. While the average rent stabilized household makes $60,000 annually, it is not uncommon for middle- or higher-income New Yorkers to live in the units, which sometimes rent for several thousand dollars per month. “The idea that we should only have people living in apartments they can’t afford seems to be setting people up for failure,” said Ellen Davidson, a housing attorney at The Legal Aid Society. “It’s not a proposal from somebody who knows anything about the housing market or New York City.” The Real Estate Board of New York, a landlord group whose members overwhelmingly backed Cuomo in the primary, did not respond to an inquiry about whether they supported the proposal. But in an email, the group’s president, James Whelan, said that the “benefits of rent regulation are not well targeted” and that some form of means testing should be considered. “Rent stabilization has never been means tested because it’s not an affordable housing program, it’s a program about neighborhood stability,” said Davidson, the housing attorney, adding that the proposal would likely present a “bureaucratic nightmare.” A spokesperson for Cuomo’s campaign, Rich Azzopardi, said in a text message that “the ultra wealthy and privileged should not be taking advantage of a program meant to aide working New Yorkers," adding that the income threshold standards would fall under the same system that governs the city's other programs for low-income housing. “While Cuomo cares only for the well-being of his Republican donors, Zohran believes city government’s job is to guarantee a life of dignity, not determine who is worth one,” she added.

Article: -- Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao's enduring status as a powerhouse couple was on display Tuesday as they reflected on their shared lives at a ceremony for the archives that will catalogue their careers. "We needed an archive largely because I never threw anything away.” The collection will span their decades of public life and offer a “front-row view of how our government and institutions operate,” McConnell said in a news release. At Tuesday's event, Chao referred to McConnell as her “best friend and teammate and also the man who is at the center of my life, the man who supported my career in public service.” She called her husband the ”most prolific" Senate party leader in history and said Kentucky continues to “reap the benefits” from his tenure. And thank you, again.” UofL President Gerry Bradley said the archives will be an “invaluable source” for scholars and historians by offering insights into the careers of McConnell and Chao. McConnell quipped that his political enemies “have been deterred from seeing any of this.” Another campus initiative close to McConnell's heart has been the McConnell Center, a nonpartisan academic program at the university that aims to prepare students for future leadership roles. The program's graduates have pursued a variety of professions — including public service, business and medicine — and many have returned to make their lives and careers in Kentucky, McConnell said.

Article: Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state’s process to get citizens’ initiatives on the ballot Campaign groups urge judge to further limit new restrictions on getting measures on Florida's ballot TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a federal judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state’s process to get citizens’ initiatives on the ballot. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee were the latest attempt by attorneys for voter advocacy groups and campaigns for Medicaid expansion and recreational marijuana to carve away at a law that they argue unconstitutionally hamstrings citizens' abilities to amend Florida's constitution. So far, Walker has issued mixed rulings in the case, freezing some portions of the law but allowing other parts to go into effect, even as the campaigns try to gather enough signatures from voters to qualify for the 2026 ballot. “They should seek their strongest basis for relief the first time, or in this case the second time, and we should move on from there," Jazil said of the plaintiffs. Legislatures in dozens of states have advanced bills recently to crack down on the public’s ability to put measures up for a vote, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. Under Florida’s law, an individual could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don’t register with the state as a petition circulator. The Republican-controlled Legislature pushed the changes months after a majority of Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.

Article: A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's “Mornings with Maria” that the administration is “laser-focused on bringing this deficit down.” The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.

They just showed up in June — 18 of those are transfers and the rest are high school players." There are a lot of unknowns — even for a veteran coach — and Gundy isn’t shy about acknowledging that. "Wherever you find the quarterback who can be productive, provide leadership, and the team will rally around him to get the best chance to win, then Coach Meacham and his staff have to find a way to build the offense around that player." The Cowboys have yet to settle on a starting quarterback, as redshirt freshmen Hauss Hejny and Zane Flores remain in a tight competition during fall camp. "I think it's important that each individual player has to find a way to motivate themselves to benefit our team," Gundy said regarding how his team can stay motivated despite numerous question marks. So that would be an example of things that motivate me to continue for our team to play well and win football games." The road back to where Oklahoma State football should be may seem long.

Article: government.” The MSNBC host noted that Long’s “crowning achievement” during his time at the agency was sending “jolly all-staff emails.” Last week, Long sent a message to employees that read, in part, “With this being Thursday before another FriYay, please enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you’ll be well rested for my 70th birthday on Monday.” Just hours after he sent that email, Long’s short tenure at the IRS came to an end, when he announced the president intended to nominate him to serve as ambassador to Iceland. While Maddow acknowledged the optics of Long’s departure may seem amusing, she told viewers there was “something else going on here” that she said was a “big deal.” Maddow referenced reporting from The Washington Post in April, that detailed Trump’s plan to use the IRS in the Department of Homeland Security’s effort to find and arrest immigrants. “Homeland Security told the IRS to go into private tax information and hand over not just names, but home addresses and phone numbers and email addresses — all this specific private information — so Homeland Security could use that information to go find people and arrest them,” Maddow explained, citing the Post’s reporting. “It was after that dispute,” Maddow noted, “that the White House reportedly decided to remove Billy Long from his job running the IRS, to instead ship him to Iceland.” “Now, we do not know whether Billy Long himself was involved in this clash. government is now using sensitive, private information from people’s taxes, including names and addresses and phone numbers, to help Trump’s immigration police track people down and arrest them.” Maddow called the situation “truly unprecedented” in the United States. “We don’t know what else they might do with this kind of detailed personal information extracted from the IRS, nor do we know what an IRS minus Billy Long might newly be willing to hand over,” Maddow concluded. “But that is where Trump has now taken this country, with or without sad, old Billy Long.” You can watch Maddow’s full comments in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: government's budget deficit grew nearly 20% in July to $291 billion despite a nearly $21 billion jump in customs duty collections from President Donald Trump's tariffs, with outlays growing faster than receipts, the Treasury Department said on Tuesday. The month of July this year had fewer business days than last year, so the Treasury Department said that adjusting for the difference would have increased receipts by about $20 billion, resulting in a deficit of about $271 billion. Net customs receipts in July grew to about $27.7 billion from about $7.1 billion in the year-earlier period due to higher tariff rates imposed by Trump, a Treasury official said. Consumer price index data on Tuesday showed increases in prices for some tariff-sensitive goods like furniture, footwear and auto parts, but they were offset by lower gasoline prices in the overall index. Receipts were up 6%, or $262 billion, to $4.347 trillion, a record high for the 10-month period, while outlays grew 7%, or $374 billion, to $5.975 trillion, also a 10-month record.

Article: President Javier Milei of Argentina has proposed a new $1m initiative to strengthen relations between Latin America and Israel, ahead of an anticipated visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Monday, the Genesis Prize Foundation — a group that offers an annual award to members of the Jewish community — announced that Milei, its most recent winner, would use his prize money to launch a new nonprofit, the American Friends of the Isaac Accords (AFOIA). “AFOIA is a vehicle to promote Milei’s bold vision and encourage other Latin American leaders to stand with Israel, confront antisemitism, and reject the ideologies of terror that threaten our shared values and freedoms,” Genesis Prize co-founder Stan Polovets said in a news release. During Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021, countries like Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in a series of deals known as the Abraham Accords. Countries like Colombia and Bolivia have severed diplomatic ties with Israel since the start of the war in 2023, and Brazil recently became the latest nation to join a case against Israel brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice. Advertisement “The Isaac Accords aim to mirror the success of the Abraham Accords by fostering diplomatic, economic, and cultural cooperation between Israel and key Latin American nations,” the news release said. “Given the hostility toward the Jewish state from some nations in the region, support of Israel by Latin American countries which are now on the sidelines is very important,” Danon said in the release. Top leaders like Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have forcefully denounced the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza, where more than 61,500 Palestinians have been killed and many risk perishing from hunger. “We cannot remain indifferent to the genocide carried out by Israel in Gaza, the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and the use of hunger as a weapon of war,” Brazil’s President Lula told the BRICS economic alliance in July. In June, for example, Milei confirmed his intention to move Argentina’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 2026, despite conflicting Israeli and Palestinian claims on the city. Advertisement Milei has also praised Israel for its human rights record, including in a social media post this past May honouring the 77th anniversary of its establishment in 1948, which resulted in the mass displacement of Palestinians. “Like Argentina, Israel is a beacon of FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY.” Milei, a Catholic, has even expressed interest in converting to Judaism, which would be a first for an Argentinian president. His selection as the 2025 Genesis Prize winner is considered a first for a non-Jewish person, and it is tradition for winners to give the cash award to a cause they support. In 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to believe they had overseen war crimes in Gaza.

READ MORE: 7.3 magnitude earthquake stirs tsunami warning along parts of Alaska’s southern coast “This will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,” Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday. The Mendenhall Glacier — a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska — acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. But 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley.

Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: Ever since he transferred to the University of Oklahoma last winter, scrutiny has followed John Mateer for how the quarterback, rated one of the best in college football, would perform on the field. This week, Mateer has found himself under the spotlight for different reasons after screenshots from his personal Venmo account surfaced on social media showing two transactions labeled “sports gambling." Both transactions were from Nov. The NCAA prohibits student-athletes and staff members from betting on sports, no matter whether at the collegiate, professional or amateur level, and breaking those rules can cost athletes their remaining eligibility. Mateer published a statement to social media Tuesday denying wrongdoing, saying that "I have not engaged in any sports gambling" and characterized the labeling of the transactions as "inside jokes between me and my friends. Mateer threw for 29 touchdowns and rushed for 15 more in 2024 during his first season as the starter at Washington State, and in December he announced his transfer to Oklahoma, a longtime power in college football attempting a revival after a pair of 6-7 seasons since 2022. Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and effectively opened the floodgates for regulated, legal sports betting in the country, the NCAA has joined other major sports leagues in wrestling with the change. When the NCAA in 2023 surveyed more than 500 on-campus athletic department employees who are tasked with ensuring compliance with NCAA rules, it found that although more than 95% of Division I schools were teaching sports-betting education, 27% of schools "had dealt with a sports betting problem among their athletes or staff within the past year, a substantial increase from a survey in 2019," according to an NCAA release. In June, the NCAA announced it was seeking to relax some of its former sports gambling regulations when the Division I Council, which oversees regulations for the NCAA's largest schools, proposed a change that would allow both student-athletes and staff members to bet on pro sports.

Article: The Crystal Palace, a music and dining joint in Bakersfield launched by Buck Owens — which hosted just about every country music star in America over the years — has abruptly shut its doors. The closure of the temple of country music, an important piece of San Joaquin Valley history, prompted an outpouring of grief from fans across the country — along with desperate pleas to stars such as Dwight Yoakam, Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift, who all played there, to save the day by buying the place. “This is so sad,” one person wrote on the Crystal Palace Instagram, tagging Dwight Yoakam and Garth Brooks and pleading with them to “keep the Crystal Palace open!” Advertisement Archival photo of Buck Owens Crystal Palace, located at 2800 Buck Owens Blvd. (Eliza Green / The Bakersfield Californian) Jim Shaw, director of the Buck Owens Private Foundation, which has owned the Crystal Palace since Owens’ death in 2006, said the closure, which was announced Monday, has “been coming for a while, and I’ve dreaded seeing it happen.” Shaw said the pandemic, along with a slowing economy and the increasingly tight margins for the restaurant business, all combined to make it “a tough business.” Plus, he added, members of the Owens family involved in the business “are in their mid- to late 70s. (Eliza Green / The Bakersfield Californian) A child of the Dust Bowl, Owens was born in Texas and spent much of his childhood in Arizona before popping up in Bakersfield‘s nascent music club scene. Some of his hits included “Together Again,” “Crying Time,” “Love’s Gonna Live Here,” “I’ve Got a Tiger by the Tail” and “Under Your Spell Again.” Advertisement It also included “Streets of Bakersfield,” which became a late-career hit with Yoakam and included these lyrics: “How many of you that sit and judged me ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?” The “Bakersfield Sound” was further cemented by another one-time member of Owens’ band, Merle Haggard, who played with the Buckaroos briefly in the 1960s. Pretty much anybody in country music played here … Taylor Swift, and Garth Brooks, and Willie Nelson, Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley.” Brooks, he noted, famously proposed to his wife Trisha Yearwood there in 2005. “I loved him,” Yoakam told The Times in 2007, shortly after Owens’ death, noting that their relationship was “part friend, part sibling, and a whole lot surrogate parent.” The Buck Owens Foundation listed the building for sale last year . The website SavingCountryMusic.com noted that the Crystal Palace is joining other small country music venues that are struggling with the new economics of the music business, which favor large arenas. “The plight for legendary, midsized country music venues continues to worsen.” Fans who are hoping that a music lover with deep pockets will swoop in and save the place can find both despair and inspiration in Owens’ lyrics. He did, after all, warn in “The Heartaches Have Just Started” that “when you see the backdoor swinging, you’ll know I’ve run out of hope.” But he also famously promised that “love’s gonna live here again.”

Article: Gavin Newsom and the University of California consider whether to sue the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in federal grants to ULCA, the White House on Tuesday had a terse response. “Bring it on, Gavin,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt when asked about Newsom’s opposition to a Trump plan demanding more than $1 billion and sweeping campus changes at UCLA to resolve federal antisemitism findings against the university. “This administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the First Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses and UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples that I will forward to Gavin Newsom’s press office, if he hasn’t seen them himself,” Leavitt said. Advertisement The statement was the first public comment from the White House about the high-stakes conflict between the nation’s premier public university system and the Trump administration, which has accused UCLA of violating the civil rights of Jewish students, illegally considering race in admissions and treating transgender people in sports, healthcare and campus life in ways that the government claims hinder women’s rights. Leavitt spoke after a question from The Times about how Trump would response Newsom’s comments late last week that the settlement offer for UCLA was “extortion” and “ransom.” “We’ll sue,” Newsom said Friday. In an earlier joint statement with California legislative leaders, Newsom said that the action against UCLA “isn’t about protecting Jewish students — it’s a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president. Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world.” No lawsuit has been filed and the UC board of regents, who held an emergency meeting Monday afternoon over the grant cuts, has not announced how it will proceed aside from calling Trump’s current terms “unacceptable.” Newsom sits as a voting member on the 24-person board, has appointed several of its members and can wield influence on the body, although the final decision on a lawsuit or settlement rests with the regents. Advertisement In a statement after the meeting, a UC spokesperson said the $1 billion price tag would be “devastating.” “UC’s leadership spent recent days evaluating the demand, updating the UC community, and engaging with stakeholders,” said Meredith Turner, UC senior vice president of external relations. “Our focus remains on protecting students’ access to a UC education and promoting the academic freedom, excellence, and innovation that have always been at the heart of UC’s work.” Hundreds of grants — from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy — are on hold at UCLA. Citing the reasons for the freezes, a July 30 NSF leter to UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk alleged UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.” Frenk, in a campuswide message the next day, disputed the funding halt.

A Texas man who fatally shot three people in a Target parking lot, including a 4-year-old child and her grandfather, had a history of mental illness and opened fire randomly, police said Tuesday. AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who fatally shot three people in a Target parking lot, including a 4-year-old child and her grandfather, had a history of mental illness and opened fire randomly, police said Tuesday. Police say 32-year-old Ethan Nieneker killed a Target worker gathering shopping carts Monday afternoon outside the store in Austin, then killed a man and his granddaughter before stealing their car. "Innocent lives were taken in broad daylight in a place where people should feel safe to run their everyday errands and to live their everyday lives." The violence sent store employees and shoppers fleeing for cover. Online court records show he had a history of arrests for domestic violence and assault, and was arrested several times in recent years in both Travis County, which includes Austin, and neighboring Williamson County. Police said that after the shooting, Nieneker stole a car from the store parking lot, wrecked that car and then stole another from a dealership before being captured about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, in south Austin, where he was taken into custody.

Trump’s takeover “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,” adding that city officials “are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.” Ms. Bowser instead directed her most palpable frustrations toward Congress, pointing out that lawmakers had opportunities in recent years to put more power in the hands of Washington residents and its mayor, but had chosen not to.

Article: A key annual United States government report on global human rights abuses has drastically shifted focus, with references removed to abuses based on sexual orientation, and poor conditions downplayed in ally nations while taking aim at those who have clashed with President Donald Trump. Released on Tuesday, the 2024 State Department Human Rights Report, was issued months late as Trump appointees altered an earlier draft dramatically to bring it in line with America First values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, and “Liberty,” and “Security of the Person.” The department referred to its new report as “streamlined” and focused on remaining “aligned to the administration’s executive orders”. While the 2023 report contains a lengthy introduction with numerous appendices and citations, the newest report has a single introductory page that stresses a desire to “minimize the amount of statistical data in the report”. Instead, the report sounds an alarm about the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues. Some 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in October 2023. While last year’s report underscored numerous acts of anti-Semitism in Hungary, noting that a local survey found half the population were “moderately or strongly anti-Semitic”, the new report says the close Trump ally has “made combating anti-Semitism a top priority, publicly emphasizing its welcoming and open environment for Jews”. The report claims “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador – where Trump has gained help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house migrant deportees in a high-security mega-prison. State Department reveals a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe. — Amnesty International USA (@amnestyusa) August 12, 2025 This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe. On Monday, rights group coalition the Council for Global Equality sued (PDF) the State Department to release report documents, alleging the department had potentially manipulated its latest human rights report. This year’s report was prepared following a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in April, wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”. Taking aim at Brazil and South Africa In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation had declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, among others. Advertisement Bolsonaro is on trial before the Supreme Court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 electoral loss to leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. It stated that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” In last year’s report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa. Trump, earlier this year, issued an executive order that called for the US to resettle Afrikaners, describing them as victims of “violence against racially disfavored landowners,” allegations that echoed far-right claims but which have been contested by South Africa’s government.

US federal prosecutors have announced criminal charges against Jimmy Cherizier, the Haitian gang leader known as "Barbecue" who leads an alliance of gangs that control much of the capitol of Port-au-Prince. "He's a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti." Prosecutors say he is suspected of playing a key role in the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped.

Article: President Donald Trump is taking a new look at reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug in a move that could nudge the federal government closer to an approach already embraced in many states. The Justice Department last year proposed to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD, to a less dangerous Schedule III substance, which includes such things as ketamine and some anabolic steroids. health authorities need to play a larger role in cannabis policy, report says It also could make it easier to research marijuana, since it’s very difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I substances. Trump is weighing the pros and cons of a marijuana policy change, noting it’s a “very complicated subject.” “I’ve heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana and “bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said Monday. As a candidate, Trump appeared open to relaxed regulation, posting on his social media platform last year that he would “focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug.” WATCH: How marijuana’s reclassification could change U.S. The National Sheriffs’ Association was among those submitting written opposition, highlighting prior determinations that marijuana has a “high abuse potential” and pointing to cases of “extreme intoxication” and fatal vehicle crashes.

I found him very straightforward and trustworthy … I was able to get a sense of his soul”) and Barack Obama (“After my election I have more flexibility,” he said to Putin’s front-office man Dmitri Medvedev). The most positive thing that can be said about this summit is that it can be cast as a final good-faith effort by the administration to give Russia a face-saving way to cut its losses: an estimated million casualties, the loss of much of its stock of tanks and bombers, NATO’s expansion, the slow strangulation of the Russian economy, a war without end. But the price on Putin should be high: full Russian withdrawal to the lines of February 2022, continued Western military assistance to Kyiv and nothing to preclude eventual Ukrainian membership in the European Union. Putin will almost surely dismiss this as a nonstarter, even if it salvages his economy and ratifies his illegal, if probably irreversible, 2014 seizure of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. A few items to lay on the table: Working with Europe to seize the estimated $300 billion of frozen Russian government assets to serve as a funding pool for Ukrainian purchases of Western arms. Signing the bipartisan Senate sanctions bill on Russia, which includes a 500 percent tariff “on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products.” Removing all technical or targeting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-supplied weapons.

Article: The United Nations has said that efforts to address widespread economic and political dysfunction and debilitating violence in Haiti are falling far short, with a UN response plan receiving the lowest funding of any in the world. In a briefing on Tuesday, coordinator Ulrika Richardson said that the UN hopes to raise more than $900m for Haiti this year, but that effort is just 9.2 percent funded. The lacklustre funding numbers underscore concerns over flagging international efforts to assist the Caribbean island nation, which is reeling from violence as powerful armed gangs jostle for control of territory and resources amid political and economic instability. Armed gangs, some with links to powerful political and economic figures, have taken control of large swathes of the capital of Port-au-Prince since the assassination of former president Jovenel Moise in July 2021. The UN has said that cutting off the supply of arms pouring into the country, largely smuggled from the US state of Florida, is a key step towards staunching the violence, along with applying sanctions on networks connected to the gangs. But international efforts to address the fighting thus far have little to show, and some Haitians are sceptical of such efforts given a long history of destructive interventions by outside powers.

Article: Anna "Delvey" Sorokin says she's received hundreds of death threats in the days since she was accused of dumping pet rabbits she posed with for a photoshoot in a Brooklyn park. But the headline-making New York City socialite — who vehemently denied responsibility for the discarded bunnies — said in an interview with NBC News that she's particularly shocked by the strong reaction over the incident. "I can never do right by these people." Sorokin shared screenshots of dozens of hateful messages she's received within the last few days to her Instagram — which she called "unusable" — with NBC News. Some of them suggest that she she should be killed or take her own life, including one that advises Sorokin to get someone to "make a carpet out of your skin." “It seems like a lot of these people, just because they’re engaged in animal rescue, they feel like they’re entitled to insult you or talk to you or say anything because they’re hiding behind this thing that they’re doing,” she said. The 34-year-old, whose life was depicted in Netflix's hit 2022 series "Inventing Anna," took the photoshoot with the bunnies on August 3 to create content for her Instagram account, which has more than 1.1 million followers. Shortly before the shoot, she posted on Instagram story asking if any of her followers in the New York City metropolitan area had a pet rabbit she could borrow for the shoot, Sorokin said. A Facebook user posted images of the domesticated bunnies in the park to a public Facebook group dedicated to rabbits, House Rabbit Society, and other users connected them to Sorokin's photos. At first, Batty denied dumping the rabbits in the park, according to screenshots of text messages between Sorokin, Batty and photographer Jasper Soloff that Sorokin posted on her Instagram story and shared with NBC News. "Jasper had no knowledge or input as to how the bunnies were obtained or what happened to them after the photo shoot," Soloff's attorney, Gary Adelman, said in a statement. Hours later, Batty confessed that he did dump the rabbits and absolved Sorokin of any involvement, according to a statement he posted to his Instagram account, which has since been taken down. "At 19, with no experience caring for animals, no pet-friendly housing, and no knowledge of available resources, I felt overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice." "Believing, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I released them there, thinking that was my best option," he added. Sorokin was convicted by a Manhattan jury in April 2019 on four counts of theft services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny after being accused of defrauding banks and friends of tens of thousands of dollars. Prosecutors said that Sorokin convinced friends and businesses to loan her money to afford a lavish lifestyle under the guise that she was the daughter of a oil baron or diplomat, worth tens of millions of dollars. "And I had the best intentions and it's really frustrating." The New York Times reported that the rabbits were rescued by blogger Terry Chao, who spotted the rabbits in the park.

Article: A Minnesota teen filed a charge of discrimination against a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant on Tuesday after she alleged that a server followed her into the women’s restroom and demanded she “prove” she was a girl. The man needs to get out of here,” according to Gender Justice, a Minnesota gender-equality organization that filed the charge on Mudra’s behalf Gerika Mudra, 18, says she was harassed by a server who accused her of being a boy in the girls' bathroom. Gender Justice Mudra, a biracial lesbian who is not transgender, said she’s been in similar situations before, where people have suggested she’s in the wrong restroom, but when she tells them she’s a woman they leave her alone. However, when she came out of the stall at Buffalo Wild Wings and told the server, “I am a lady,” she said the server responded, “You have to get out now,” according to a statement shared by Gender Justice. Google maps Gender Justice filed the charge of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, arguing that what happened to Mudra violates the state’s Human Rights Act, which protects people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, among other protected classes. Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, said at a news conference Tuesday that even though Mudra is not trans, the server’s actions “were based on assumptions that she made about” Mudra, and Minnesota’s law protects against discrimination based on stereotypes or assumptions about protected characteristics like gender identity. “When that doesn’t happen, the business is liable for the harm caused.” Gender Justice said Mudra’s experience “reflects a broader climate of fear and suspicion aimed at anyone who doesn’t conform to narrow expectations of what girls and women ‘should’ look like.” That suspicion has been driven largely by the wave of state legislation targeting trans people, particularly their access to school sports and bathrooms that align with their gender identities, though Minnesota has not enacted any such legislation. Nineteen states have laws that prohibit trans people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities in K-12 schools, and in many of those states the restrictions apply to other government-owned buildings as well, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. That’s the terrifying reality too many trans people live with every day.” Even if Mudra had been trans, she would be able to file a discrimination complaint under state law in Minnesota, which is one of 21 states and Washington, D.C., that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations, according to the Movement Advancement Project.

Article: WASHINGTON — Over the weekend, President Donald Trump urged homeless people living in Washington, D.C., to move out “IMMEDIATELY” and claimed “we will give you places to stay" that are "FAR" from the nation's capital. On Monday, he announced that he was federalizing Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard, saying the federal government will be “removing homeless encampments from all over our parks” in order to “rescue" Washington "from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” There were “many places” homeless people could go, Trump continued. Park Police will begin enforcing “pre-existing laws that are already on the books” to clear encampments as the president seeks to crack down on crime and “clean up” the nation’s capital. Advocates for homeless people in Washington told NBC News that they have not yet heard of any widespread action against people living on the streets, but they are bracing themselves for Tuesday night. What if they are not mentally ill or drug addicted but just poor and they live here?” According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness is at an all-time high across the United States. The majority of those people already stay in emergency shelters, according to the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, while nearly 800 people live unsheltered on the streets on any given night in Washington. Leavitt said that there are only two remaining homeless encampments in federal parks in Washington that are under the jurisdiction of the Park Police, adding that 70 encampments had been removed since Trump signed an executive order in March directing Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to direct the National Park Service to remove homeless encampments. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that she hadn’t been briefed on the plan for homeless people but planned to follow up with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom she met with on Tuesday. official added, stressing that the mayor has said she wants homelessness to be “brief, rare and non-reoccurring.” Wassenich compared clearing encampments to “a game of whack-a-mole.” “You can’t be here, so they move somewhere else,” he said.

Article: The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it would begin a wide-ranging review of current and planned exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution, scouring wall text, websites and social media “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.” White House officials announced the review in a letter sent to Lonnie G. Museums will be required to adjust any content that the administration finds problematic within 120 days, the letter said, “replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate and constructive descriptions.” The review, which will begin with eight of the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, is the latest attempt by President Trump to try to impose his will on the Smithsonian, which is governed by a Board of Regents that includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans and is overseen by Congress. The White House said in its letter that its review “aims to ensure alignment with the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” The letter adds that the “goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America’s heritage.”

The researcher, Dennis Bell, was 25 years old on July 26, 1959, when he fell into a chasm on King George Island, which is part of the South Shetland Islands and is about 75 miles north of Antarctica. Bell, who grew up in northwest London and was known as Tink, had been working as a meteorologist for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, the predecessor of the BAS, which oversees most of Britain’s research in Antarctica.

Article: Pirro was back on Fox News with her former colleague Sean Hannity — he introduced her as a “friend of the program” — echoing the same calls for law and order she had made earlier that day and, for years before that, as a co-host of Fox News’s “The Five.” Right-wing media has embraced Mr. Trump’s crackdown in Washington, dismissing Democrats’ concerns about creeping authoritarianism and any exaggerations about the level of crime in the nation’s capital (Washington’s violent crime rate fell sharply last year, though it remains higher than that of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.) MAGA influencers like Charlie Kirk have called for a “full military occupation” of other major cities. Pirro’s return to her old network home was a small illustration of Fox News’s feedback loop with the second Trump administration, which, like its predecessors in both parties, regularly cites media coverage that validates and amplifies its policy goals.

Article: 1 payroll report , CPI would have had to come in piping hot to undermine the Street's conviction that the window is wide open for the Fed to resume rate cuts in September. Economists will, and should, point out that CPI inflation remains sticky and well above the Fed's 2% target, but markets, politics and Fed rhetoric are forcing a view that rates have room to fall to make them "less restrictive." The market sees CPI as the last known potential catalyst that could have truly upended the bullish case until Labor Day, even though we'll get retail sales, some consumer earnings and a lot of Fed rhetoric in coming weeks. The rally to new highs in the S & P 500 and Nasdaq came after a couple weeks of internal consolidation when the majority of stocks were in pullback/digestion mode while the elite AI-propelled mega-cap tech names held the indexes aloft.

Your money in a high-yield savings account is federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which means that deposits up to $250,000 are protected if the bank were to suddenly collapse. Common high-yield terms you should know ACH transfer: When you want to make small and frequent payments electronically (direct deposit, automated bill payments, etc.); typically always free but usually takes at least one business day to complete the transfer. When you make a transaction at an ATM that is outside your bank's network, then a fee will most likely be applied by both the ATM operator and your bank. Mobile deposit: Instead of going to the bank to deposit a check, you can use your mobile banking app to scan a photo of the check and have the funds immediately deposited into your account. Wire transfer: When you want to move funds from one bank account to another and have the money available for use on the same business day; banks usually charge a fee. Pros and cons of having a high-yield savings account Pros of a high-yield savings account Above-average APYs FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per account Funds are accessible up to a limit usually Some accounts offer ATM cards for savers Easy to find an account with zero monthly fees and zero, or low, minimum requirements Most accounts are online and easy to manage on the go with mobile banking apps Easy to transfer money between other bank accounts Good vehicle for emergency savings or a short-term savings goal Cons of a high-yield savings account APYs are variable and can change at any time Some banks impose monthly withdrawal or transfer limits Not all accounts offer ATM cards Since most accounts are online, there are limited to no in-person banking options available While you can transfer your funds from one bank to another, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours Not a good way to grow your wealth long-term since inflation can outpace the interest you earn over time FAQs What is the difference between a high-yield savings account and a traditional savings account?

Article: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez warned staffers about the dangers of misinformation during an agencywide meeting, the first since last week’s shooting at CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta that left one police officer dead, according to a transcript of her remarks obtained by NBC News. Monarez conducted Tuesday’s staff meeting virtually, joined by Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jeff Williams, director of the CDC’s Office of Safety, Security and Asset Management, in an effort to reassure the people who work at the Atlanta campus about their safety. We need to rebuild the trust together.” Monarez said the agency can rebuild that trust with “rational, evidence-based discourse” communicated with ”compassion and understanding.” The suspected shooter, Patrick White, 30, fired close to 200 rounds that struck six buildings at the CDC’s campus, law enforcement officials said at a separate press conference Tuesday. She said that as staffers return to campus in the coming weeks, it will be “different” and “unsettling, in many ways, for some time to come.” White's motive remains under investigation, although officials said they found documents at his home in Kennesaw, Georgia, expressing his discontent with the Covid vaccines. When asked if Kennedy planned to address vaccine misinformation, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said Monarez and CDC leadership “remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff,” Nixon said in the statement to NBC News. In a statement released Tuesday, Joseph Kanter, the CEO of The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a group that represents state public health agencies, said “in this time of heated rhetoric and polarization, we implore everyone to help dampen inflammatory slander undeservingly aimed at public health professionals.” On Monday, Kennedy visited CDC’s headquarters, where security led him through campus, pointing out shattered windows across multiple buildings, according to statement released by HHS. The HHS statement also said the agency "continues to support CDC personnel and their families.” Over the weekend, Kennedy sent an email to staff, saying the agency is “standing together” in the wake of the shooting. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” He has also taken steps the limit use of the updated Covid vaccines for the fall, restricting its use to older adults and those with underlying health conditions.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. Sherrod Brown plans to launch a comeback bid for Senate in Ohio, a major recruiting win for Democrats who need to catch every break they can in their uphill fight for the majority in the chamber. Brown is viewed by Democrats as one of the few, if not the only, members of their party who could put the seat in the red-trending state in play next year. Democrats feel even better about the chances Cooper — who has won several statewide contests — has in a state Trump carried more narrowly (3 points) in 2024, particularly with incumbent Republican Thom Tillis declining to seek another term. A tough map: Even if Democrats manage to flip North Carolina and Maine, while holding battlegrounds like Georgia and Michigan, they’d still need to win two other Republican-held seats to take control of the Senate. There’s a growing Democratic field in the Hawkeye State: Josh Turek, a state lawmaker and former Paralympian with two gold medals, is the latest entrant in the race for GOP Sen. Our own NBC News poll spotted this trend early this year and recent surveys show it persisting, including one from CNBC last week that found that just 22% of Americans have a positive perception of the Democratic Party, compared to 55% negative. This indicates that hostility to President Donald Trump and the GOP remains the central motivating force for Democratic voters, more than enough to override any qualms they have about their own side. As Trump’s second terms began, our NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats wanted their party to dig in and oppose Trump instead of seeking compromise — a reversal from the start of Trump’s first term.

Article: An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Eventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don't happen all at once," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. "That will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come." Other central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia's on Tuesday cut for the third time this year. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that "the demand environment does not seem to be improving." Cardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market's expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.

The octagon cage fight event was announced by UFC boss Dana White, whose friendship with the president dates back to the early 2000s when Trump hosted some of the first ever UFC events at his business properties. "So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings." Trump had teased the idea of hosting a fight at the White House during an event last month in Iowa. He indicated that there were ideas to build a cage for the fight on the grounds of the White House and suggested the event could host up to 25,000 people. "We're going to have a UFC fight, think of this, on the grounds of the White House," Trump said at a 4 July Salute to America event in the state.

The Phoenix, beaten in both of their first two fixtures, needed 61 runs from 24 balls with six wickets left before captain Livingstone struck five balls from superstar Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid for 26 runs, with three sixes and two fours. Then, with three to defend from the last five, Saqib Mahmood took two wickets in two balls but Benny Howell drove a four and Livingstone finished 69 not out from 27 - Phoenix completing the third-highest chase in The Hundred with four wickets and two balls to spare. There was needle between the sides throughout the contest, with Curran appearing to celebrate in the direction of Livingstone after he dismissed Jacob Bethell for eight, at which stage Livingstone had 16. "He is one of my good friends and he called me a fat slob or something so I thought 'let's hope you don't go for a few if you come back at the death' and he did so I'm kind of happy with that." Rashid's final figures - 0-59 from 20 balls - are the most expensive in the tournament as the Invincibles' winning start to the tournament ended.

Article: Trump official tells census workers Congress has final say over the count, not Trump toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Less than a week after President Trump said he has ordered a "new" census," the cabinet official who oversees the Census Bureau acknowledged Tuesday that Congress, not the president, has final say over the national head count that's used to reshape election maps and guide federal funding, NPR has exclusively learned. Speaking at a town-hall event for the bureau's employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that when tallying the country's population, the census should differentiate people living in the U.S. Sponsor Message Lutnick said if a person has "broken into the country," they need to be counted in the census, but they should be counted as someone who has "broken into the country," the three employees confirmed to NPR. Lutnick's remarks come amid a Republican-led campaign to use census data to redraw congressional voting maps in Texas and other states ahead of next year's midterm election in an attempt to maintain GOP control of the House of Representatives. Ron DeSantis and some GOP lawmakers in Congress have floated conducting a census before the next scheduled count in 2030 so that new results can be used to redistribute House seats among the states and redraw maps of congressional voting districts — all before the 2026 election. Lutnick's comments on Tuesday mark the first known acknowledgement by a top Trump administration official of the potential legal hurdles facing any attempt to carry out the president's census call. The 14th Amendment requires the "whole number of persons in each state" to be counted in the 2030 census apportionment numbers, which are set to be used to determine each state's new share of House seats and Electoral College votes. Brian Schatz of Hawaii: "Since the first sentence of the 14th Amendment of that clause says we will count each whole person, I promise you we will count each whole person. citizens to be counted" in the census, Lutnick said: "Consistency makes sense." Some Republicans are still pushing for a census before the 2026 midterms Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to carry out a national tally "in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." In Title 13 of the U.S. That federal law also allows for a mid-decade census in 2025, but it can't be used to redistribute House seats and a legal deadline to prepare for such a count has already passed. Still, Trump said in the social media post that he instructed the Commerce Department to "immediately begin work" on a "new" census that excludes people living in the states without legal status. Sponsor Message Hours after Trump's census call, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the Census Bureau "will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data" and "accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States." The department replied with that same statement when asked by NPR on Tuesday whether Lutnick has communicated to the White House his position on Congress' authority over the census and whether the commerce secretary plans to propose adding a census question about a person's immigration status, which the bureau has yet to test. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to change current federal law and allow for a new census, redistribution of House seats and a new round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election. Florida's state Attorney General James Uthmeier — a former Trump administration official who helped come up with a failed plan to exclude people without legal status from the 2020 census apportionment numbers — made two proposals. Uthmeier suggested states get new shares of House seats before the 2026 midterm election based on a census "recount" in areas of states that the Census Bureau estimates it over- or undercounted in 2020. Sponsor Message "We are energized by President Trump's leadership," Uthmeier wrote, "and we look forward to hearing from you and working together to resolve these issues." Edited by Megan Pratz

Article: A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to swiftly remedy conditions inside migrant holding cells in New York City where detainees have complained of squalid and overcrowded conditions. Kaplan, ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to hold fewer people in the 10th-floor holding cells of the agency’s Lower Manhattan offices at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE has been accused of detaining dozens of migrants for days or weeks in tight quarters meant to hold detainees for just a few hours. The judge also ordered ICE to allow migrants to place calls to their lawyers and to ensure that they have access to proper medical and hygienic care following allegations that detainees were deprived of showers, given meager meals and forced to sleep on the concrete floor without any bedding. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday by legal organizations representing a Peruvian immigrant, Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was arrested by ICE and held at 26 Federal Plaza last week.

Article: Black civil rights leaders and the mayors of several cities on Tuesday denounced the deployment of the National Guard to the nation’s capital to combat crime, calling it “fundamentally grandstanding” and “a federal coup.” And by suggesting that other cities, also run by Black mayors, may be next, President Donald Trump was “playing the worst game of racially divisive politics,” one rights leader said. “And we will bring in the military if it’s needed.” Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said the president’s actions and words were racially polarizing, considering crime rates in these cities are largely declining. “This is a distraction at a time when these cities deserve credit because crime and violence are down in most American cities right now, and this is trying to distract from that success, and in effect, create a de facto police state in these cities,” Morial told NBC News. ‒ especially those living on the streets, who need the most care ‒ will suffer, alongside the core principles of our Democracy.” And NAACP president Derrick Johnson questioned the declaration of an emergency in D.C., calling it a “federal coup.” The White House responded to the criticisms in a statement to NBC News: “There is nothing divisive about cracking down on crime in our nation’s capital to make it safer and more beautiful for all residents and visitors from all around the world,” said White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers. This is why Democrats continue to be so unpopular among everyday Americans — they think the President of the United States cracking down on crime in our nation’s capital is a bad thing.” Trump federalized the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department over the weekend and called the nation’s capital “one of the most dangerous cities in the world.” It followed the fatal shooting of a congressional intern in July and the carjacking of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer in D.C. Black Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in their lifetimes than white Americans, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump’s move, which he had hinted at for months, is “unsettling and unprecedented.” The administration forced the removal of the Black Lives Matter street painting that had been prominent in the city since 2020 by threatening to hold back millions in funding if it remained. “What the White House should be doing is restoring the SNAP cuts and restoring the Medicaid cuts, which are going to do damage to Washington, D.C., and other urban communities,” Morial said. “When it comes to public safety in Baltimore, he should turn off the right-wing propaganda and look at the facts.” Homicides are down 28% in Baltimore this year alone, reaching the lowest level of any year on record, with overall crime rates lower than it’s been in more than 50 years. “We still have real work to do to build on this progress—but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.” And as Scott pointed out, “it’s not just Baltimore.” In Chicago, violent crime also is down by more than 30% and shootings almost 40%. Mayor Brandon Johnson said the dramatic reductions occurred even as Trump cut “$158 million in funding for violence prevention programs in cities like Chicago,” as well as Los Angeles, New York, D.C. “If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,” Johnson said. “may not be the most productive approach, especially when local leaders and law enforcement are already making significant strides in reducing crime and improving community trust.” Johnson implored the Trump administration to work with mayors and to “support solutions that strengthen law enforcement partnerships and community engagement.” Republicans backed Trump’s move.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about the possibility of resettling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the war-torn East African country, part of a wider effort by Israel to facilitate mass emigration from the territory left in ruins by its 22-month offensive against Hamas. “I think that the right thing to do, even according to the laws of war as I know them, is to allow the population to leave, and then you go in with all your might against the enemy who remains there,” Netanyahu said Tuesday in an interview with i24, and Israeli TV station.

The State Department, asked if there was any quid pro quo with South Sudan, said decisions on the issuing of visas are made “in a way that prioritizes upholding the highest standards for U.S. national security, public safety, and the enforcement of our immigration laws.” From one hunger-stricken conflict zone to another Many Palestinians might want to leave Gaza, at least temporarily, to escape the war and a hunger crisis bordering on famine. They fear that Israel will never allow them to return, and that a mass departure would allow it to annex Gaza and reestablish Jewish settlements there, as called for by far-right ministers in the Israeli government. The oil-rich country is plagued by corruption and relies on international aid to help feed its 11 million people – a challenge that has only grown since the Trump administration made sweeping cuts to foreign assistance. Yakani, of the civil society group, said South Sudanese would need to know who is coming and how long they plan to stay, or there could be hostilities due to the “historical issues with Muslims and Arabs.” “South Sudan should not become a dumping ground for people,” he said.

Article: On Monday, Trump announced that he was extending the trade truce between the United States and China, just hours before a new tariff hike was set to go into effect. Shortly after Trump’s eleventh-hour announcement, “The Weeknight” co-host Symone Sanders Townsend blasted the president for his reversal: “Donald Trump folded.” She said the extension is more proof that the administration is failing to reach a “consensus on trade deals” across the board. While the president has touted various frameworks of deals, Sanders Townsend said those agreements are not final or concrete: “Let’s just be very clear: The fact that he’s doing trade deals is a lie. These are not trade deals.” Co-host Alicia Menendez added that such lies have consequences, saying that one of the “most important” elements at play is the “uncertainty that he is absolutely dedicated to infusing into the economy.” “The on-again, off-again, the fact that the deadlines are [coming],” she continued. He is arbitrarily deciding on these deadlines, announcing these deadlines; there are no proof points that it has actually helped him to move these negotiations along.” Menendez went on to quote an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal, which compared Trump’s efforts to exert political control over the U.S. “It is more like state capitalism, a hybrid between socialism and capitalism in which the state guides the decisions of nominally private enterprises.” “This is the point right here,” Sanders Townsend interjected, adding: “If we really pull the layers back, we need to ask: Is it the government that has a stake, or is it a private entity somewhere that somehow Donald Trump or his treasury secretary has his tentacles in? So I just think people should continue to ask more questions.” You can watch the remarks by Sanders Townsend and Menendez in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: White House to conduct review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions to ensure they fit with Trump's view of American history The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is seen from the Washington Monument, June 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The White House plans to conduct a wide-ranging review of the Smithsonian Institution's museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America's 250th anniversary next year to ensure the museums align with President Donald Trump's view of American history, a White House official confirmed to ABC News. In a letter sent to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the White House writes that it wants to ensure that the museums "reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story." The White House writes that in accordance with a March executive order, "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," officials will be leading a "comprehensive internal review of selected Smithsonian museums and exhibitions. This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions." The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is seen from the Washington Monument, June 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Kevin Carter/Getty Images The review will focus on several key areas, including examining public-facing content, such as exhibition texts, websites and social media "to assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals." In addition, the review will examine the curatorial process, current and future exhibitions, how existing materials and collections are used and the development of "consistent curatorial guidelines that reflect the Smithsonian's original mission." For now, the review will focus on eight Smithsonian museums: The National Museum of American History The National Museum of Natural History The National Museum of African American History and Culture The National Museum of the American Indian The National Air and Space Museum The Smithsonian American Art Museum The National Portrait Gallery The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden In a statement, the Smithsonian Institution said: "The Smithsonian's work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents."

Article: Real Madrid has said that it “firmly rejects” having a regular-season Spanish league game played in the United States and warned of “a turning point in the world of football”. Villarreal, in contrast, is promising free travel and tickets for season-ticket holders if its match against Barcelona in Miami is approved, in what would be a first for the league. Madrid said on Tuesday that it has taken action to keep the December 20 match from happening in the US, claiming it would hurt the “integrity of the competition” and the “legitimacy of the results”. “The measure, which was taken without prior information or consultation of the clubs participating in the competition, infringes the essential principle of territorial reciprocity, which applies in two-legged league competitions (one match at home and the other at the home of the opposing team), upsetting the competitive balance and giving an undue sporting advantage to the applicant clubs,” Madrid said. The Europe-wide fan group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) said it was “liaising” with members, soccer stakeholders, affected groups and partner organisations to “collectively resist the latest threat to the very nature of football”. “Moving games from their domestic territories strikes at the heart of the relationship between fans and their teams, breaking vital links between clubs and their communities.” The group also criticised a similar move by the Italian league to play a match abroad. The Italian football federation said in July that a plan was in motion to play the Serie A match between AC Milan and Como in the Australian city of Perth in February. Madrid asks FIFA and UEFA to withhold permission for Barcelona game Madrid said it has asked FIFA, UEFA and Spain’s top sport body to not authorise the game in the US. “Any modification of this nature must, in any case, have the express and unanimous agreement of all the clubs participating in the competition, as well as strictly respecting the national and international rules governing the organization of official competitions,” Madrid said. The club said UEFA should deny the request to play the game abroad, based on the “criterion established in 2018 that prevents official matches in domestic competitions from being played outside national territory, except in duly justified exceptional circumstances, which are not present here”. “Real Madrid reaffirms its commitment to respect the national and international rules that guarantee the fairness and proper functioning of official competitions, and will defend its compliance with them before all competent bodies,” the club said. “It would greatly help us expand our brand in a key market like the United States.” Staging a match abroad has long been part of the league’s goal to promote football and its brand in other countries. Advertisement It first tried to stage a match in the US in 2018, with a game between Barcelona and Girona, but the idea was dismissed after criticism from players, fans and clubs. The attempts to play in the US are part of the league’s long-term partnership with sport and entertainment group Relevent Sports, which is part of Stephen Ross’s portfolio of companies, including Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins, the Formula One’s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament. Earlier this year, it was announced that New York-based Relevent Sports has exclusive negotiating rights over the global commercial rights to the UEFA men’s club competitions for the period 2027-2033.

Article: The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and other agencies also held meetings with Baidu and smaller Chinese tech firms in recent weeks, said one of the two people and a third source. Authorities in China expressed concern that the materials Nvidia has asked companies to submit for review with the US government could contain sensitive information, including client data, one of the sources said. Advertisement Several companies were issued official notices discouraging the use of the H20, a lower-end chip, mainly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. In a separate report, The Information reported that ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent had been ordered by the CAC in the past two weeks to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether, citing data security concerns. The CAC directive was communicated at a meeting the regulator held with more than a dozen Chinese tech firms, shortly after the administration of United States President Donald Trump reversed the export curbs on H20 chips, according to the Information report. But even without an outright ban, the concerns expressed by Chinese authorities could threaten Nvidia’s recently restored access to the Chinese market as Chinese companies look to keep in step with regulators. Threat to revenue stream Last month, China’s cyberspace regulator summoned Nvidia representatives, asking the company to explain whether the H20 posed backdoor security risks that could affect Chinese user data and privacy. China has accelerated work on domestic AI chip alternatives, with companies such as Huawei developing processors that rival the H20’s performance, and Beijing urging the technology sector to become more self-sufficient. Advertisement On Monday, US President Donald Trump suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China, despite deep-seated fears in Washington that Beijing could harness US AI capabilities to supercharge its military. The Trump administration last week confirmed an unprecedented deal with Nvidia and AMD, which agreed to give the US government 15 percent of revenue from sales of some advanced chips in China.

Article: DALLAS — Congresswoman Julie Johnson (D-Dallas) sent a letter to Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux demanding specifics on the department's interactions with federal immigration authorities, as frustration from members of the community and the city's police oversight board mounts. The Community Police Oversight Board was set to vote Tuesday on next steps after a response to a short response from Comeaux after the City Attorney's office prevented him from answering specific questions on immigration at a contentious June meeting. The number of public comment speakers at last Wednesday's City Council meeting with questions about immigration led City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert to issue a memo stating the city is committed to following "all relevant laws and regulations regarding immigration." "Dallas’ strength is the rich tapestry of our communities," Tolbert wrote. The federal government is primarily responsible for enforcing immigration laws." Comeaux has previously said that the department's policy has not changed and DPD will assist legal requests from federal partners, including ICE. Are they providing security?" He described the experience of trying to get answers from the department as "frustrating." "A lot of people in our community are very uncomfortable, and I don’t think we're going to let this stand. "People are not afraid of DPD, they’re afraid of what’s going on in our country." He said he feels the department has handled immigration well and said the chief has answered questions "diplomatically" but to his satisfaction.

Article: ATLANTA (AP) — Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America. It’s not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O’Neill Institute’s Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar’s scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers’ lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034. “The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they’ve stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA’s human rights work for 2026. READ MORE: What the Trump travel ban means for the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA’s offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump’s immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.” Miami-Dade officials referred The Associated Press to the local host committee, which did not respond to requests for comment. More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. READ MORE: Brazil to host 2027 Women’s World Cup, a first for South America Atlanta officials and partners say the Downtown Rising plan is a part of the mayor’s larger investments in reducing homelessness and building affordable housing. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. It’s not about human rights in any meaningful way.” Working to address standards FIFA’s human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men’s 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations’ guiding principles.” A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia. In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights” seriously and she wouldn’t be participating in the effort if she didn’t think that was possible. Candace Stanciel, Atlanta’s chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. The International Labour Organization called FIFA’s human rights framework “an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.

After Border Patrol agents last week sprang from a Penske moving truck and snatched up workers at a Westlake Home Depot — appearing to openly defy the court’s order — some attorneys warned the rule of law is crumbling in plain sight. “Somewhere there are Founding Fathers who are turning over in their graves.” Advertisement The chaotic immigration arrests that swept through Los Angeles this summer had all but ceased following the original July 11 order, which bars agents from snatching people off the streets without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. For the punch-drunk Department of Justice, the 9th Circuit loss was the latest blow in a protracted judicial beatdown, as many of the administration’s most aggressive moves have been held back by federal judges and tied up in appellate courts. In the last two weeks alone, the 9th Circuit also found Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional and signaled it would likely rule in favor of a group of University of California researchers hoping to claw back funding from Trump’s war on so-called DEI policies. (FOX News/Matt Finn via AP) The Department of Justice argues that the same power that allows the president to federalize troops and deploy them on American streets also creates a “Constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law that bars the soldiers from civilian police action. Even if they keep taking losses, Trump administration officials “don’t have much to lose” by picking fights, said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University and a Constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute. “There’s no indication to me that [Department of Homeland Security agents] are changing their behavior.” Some scholars speculated the lower court bloodbath might actually be a strategic sacrifice in the war to extend presidential power in the Supreme Court. “They are losing cases right and left in the district court, but consistently having district court orders stayed in the Supreme Court.” Advertisement Win or lose in the lower courts, the political allure of targeting California is potent, argued Segall, the law professor who studies the Supreme Court. “I don’t think martial law is off the table.” Pedro Vásquez Perdomo, a day laborer who is one of the plaintiffs on the Southern California case challenging racial profiling by immigration enforcement, has said the case is bigger than him. 4, his voice trembling as he spoke about the temporary restraining order — upheld days earlier by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — that stood between his fellow Angelenos and unchecked federal authority.

Article: -- Government-run medical centers serving the nation's veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs — out of 484,000 — through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers. Pete Kasperowicz, the VA's press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore “not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.” “The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,” Kasperowicz wrote. He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with “normal VA historical averages.” But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration's profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA. They’ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.” Simon also noted the VA’s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment. The VA said in a news release that the move will “make it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America’s Veterans.” But U.S. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs “and ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they’ve earned.” “We also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting," said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia.

Article: The United States has sanctioned an armed group accused of illicit mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as both the army and the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group traded accusations of violating a recently reached US-mediated ceasefire deal by attacking each other’s positions. The US Department of the Treasury said on Tuesday that it was blocking all interests and restricting transactions with Pareco-FF, an armed group that it said controlled the key coltan mining site of Rubaya from 2022 to 2024, and which has opposed the M23 group. It also slapped sanctions on the Congolese mining company CDMC, saying it sold minerals that were sourced and smuggled from mines near Rubaya and two Hong Kong-based export companies, East Rise and Star Dragon, which have been accused of buying minerals from the armed group. “The United States is sending a clear message that no armed group or commercial entity is immune from sanctions if they undermine peace, stability or security in the DRC,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Advertisement The sanctions come as Congolese army spokesman Sylvain Ekenge said in a statement that the M23 group’s “almost daily” attacks constitute an “intentional and manifest violation” of the declaration of principles, which the two parties signed in mid-July in Doha, whose terms include a “permanent ceasefire”. It followed a separate peace deal between the Congolese and Rwandan governments, signed in Washington, DC, the previous month, which also helped the US government and US companies gain control of critical minerals in the region. A new surge of unrest broke out early this year when the M23 group captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, setting up their own administrations, with thousands killed in the conflict. Violence has continued on the ground despite the US and Qatar-brokered peace deal, with fighting becoming more intense since Friday around the town of Mulamba in South Kivu province, where the front line had been relatively stable since March. The M23 attacked positions between Friday and Monday held by pro-Kinshasa militia and army forces, and pushed them back several kilometres, after clashes using light and heavy weapons, local and security sources said.

Article: County prosecutors plan to file additional corruption charges this week against City Councilman Curren Price, who is already facing multiple counts of grand theft and perjury for allegedly voting in favor of projects his wife had a financial interest in, multiple sources told The Times. The charges were expected to be made public Thursday during a pretrial hearing in downtown L.A., according to three people with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about an ongoing criminal case. Prosecutors said Price’s wife — Del Richardson, founder of the consulting company Del Richardson & Associates — received “payments totaling more than $150,000 between 2019 and 2021 from developers before [Price] voted to approve projects.” Advertisement The perjury charges stem from a claim that Price didn’t list his wife’s income on disclosure forms. Prosecutors also accused Price of theft by embezzlement for bilking the city out of tens of thousands of dollars by placing Richardson on his city-issued healthcare plan between 2013 and 2017, before they were legally married. Price’s attorney, Michael Schafler, called the new charges “nothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.” “They have gone back as much as 6 years, combing through thousands and thousands of votes, to find a couple more allegedly conflicted votes, hoping that the public will overlook the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that Councilmember Price was aware of the alleged conflicts when he voted for the agenda items,” Schafler said in a statement. Advertisement The original criminal complaint was filed roughly four years after a Times investigation found Price had repeatedly cast votes that affected housing developers and other firms listed as clients of his wife’s consulting company. Advertisement In an October 2023 motion seeking to dismiss the charges, Price’s legal team argued prosecutors failed to show the payments to Richardson had any influence on the councilman’s votes. Many of the votes described in the criminal complaint were also approved by an overwhelming majority of the council, meaning Price did not swing any one decision that could financially benefit Richardson. Schafler also argued the embezzlement charges are invalid because Price did not have control over the funds used to pay for Richardson’s healthcare, which is a required element of the crime under California law.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The director of the agency that produces the nation’s jobs and inflation data is typically a mild-mannered technocrat, often with extensive experience in statistical agencies, with little public profile. WATCH: Trump presents data with economist Stephen Moore, days after BLS chief fired His selection threatens to bring a new level of politicization to what for decades has been a nonpartisan agency widely accepted as a producer of reliable measures of the nation’s economic health. While many former Labor Department officials say it it unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented. 4 — a week before he was nominated — Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices. WATCH: Amy Walter and Jasmine Wright on Trump’s BLS firing and trust in institutions The monthly employment reports are probably the closest-watched economic data on Wall Street, and can frequently cause swings in stock prices. Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritizes getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favor Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15%. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS Commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. They don’t organize it.” Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen.

Article: 12 minutes ago Share Save Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent Share Save BBC A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs. Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images Vauxhall's Luton plant has been building cars since 1905 until production stopped earlier this year In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953. Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale. "You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on." And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges. "Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy." He is concerned about what has already been lost. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers. Adam Vaughan/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the UK's leading manufacturers, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has deliberately moved upmarket in recent years, meaning it now sells fewer cars - also contributing to the lower figure of UK car production "Obviously, Brexit had a big impact", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. "It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility." As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles. Reuters/ Chris Radburn 'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry. "Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production," explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics. The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency. The investments starting to bear fruit When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year. A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production. "The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers." Toby Melville/PA Wire Just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025 Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit. "The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive." Yang Dong/VCG via Getty Images Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market. "If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry," argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images The UK is home to a number of luxury car firms, such as Bentley "I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in," says the executive, who asked not to be named. "It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand." Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars. "Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go." This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry. Bloomberg via Getty Images ‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’ Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. "[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else."

Article: Police get new guidance on releasing suspects' ethnicity It comes after a series of high-profile cases including that of two men, reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire. Welcoming the new guidance, a Home Office spokesperson said: "Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them." What are the rules around police giving out a suspect's nationality? As it stands, there is nothing in the College of Policing's guidance on media relations that prevents police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even ethnicity of someone who has been charged. In May, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's winning of the Premiership title, Merseyside Police were quick to reveal that the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a terrorist attack in the public interest. Conversely, the forces decision not to release information about Axel Rudakubana - the man jailed for murdering Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, in Southport last summer - allowed false information to spread. Referring to the riots, Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, described it as the "real-world consequences" of the information the police release into the public domain. He said: "We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels." He added that "being as fair, consistent and transparent as we can will improve confidence in policing". Chief Constable Sir Andy Marsh, CEO at the College of Policing, added that the interim guidance would "bring consistency" and that "information can be released for all ethnicities and nationalities when it meets the right criteria." The guidance has been developed following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Home Office and the College of Policing will update its current authorised professional practice for media relations later this year. The Home Office spokesperson added: "The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld. "The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. "The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial."

We have seen a rise in that violent rhetoric online over the past few years, but that coupling of I am in pain and suffering to I must take that out on individuals who are working in health-related fields, that is relatively new and quite scary and I think reflected in the shooting. Having those gestures after things like — if I go back to something like 9/11, right, which was a terrorist attack, and, in many ways, this was a terrorist attack, those gestures, those symbolic acts do make a difference, understanding that just because only one person died it does not mean that this was not a severe attack with severe consequences both in the short and long term for the psychological well-being of people that work in this field, as well as potentially for their physical health. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention the CDC started promoting a fund-raiser to help the family of the officer who was killed in the line of duty, DeKalb County Officer David Rose.

Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The SAFE Act also prohibits doctors from referring trans youth to other providers for gender-affirming care, which can include puberty blockers and hormone therapy, among other treatments. “I applaud the court’s decision recognizing that Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological health of children and am pleased that children in Arkansas will be protected from risky, experimental procedures with lifelong consequences,” Griffin said in a statement. Advertisement The American Civil Liberties Association — which brought the original challenge to the 2021 law alongside a doctor who provided gender-affirming care in the state and four transgender youths and their families — slammed the ruling. Advertisement Advertisement “This is a tragically unjust result for transgender Arkansans, their doctors, and their families,” Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a statement Tuesday. The law has already had a profound impact on families across Arkansas who all deserve a fundamental right to do what is best for their children.” Griffin and the state’s medical board filed the appeal with the 8th Circuit in July 2023, after U.S. Advertisement Moody had said the ban violated the rights of transgender people and endangered their health: “Rather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence showed that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of patients and that, by prohibiting it, the state undermined the interests it claims to be advancing.” Advertisement Advertisement The 8th Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed Moody’s ruling.

Wesner said he learned of Gretzky's arrival at the bar when his bartender working the afternoon shift, Rodney Griffin, called to let him know that the greatest hockey player of all-time had just sat down to order a beer. There were only a handful of folks in the bar at the time; Gretzky came in just after the spot opened at 3 p.m., and stayed for about 45 minutes. It was a short trip – Griffin said Gretzky was offered a shot at the bar, but turned it town (like we said, he's taken plenty of those on the ice in the past) – but one the bar will remember for a long time.

Article: Over the last nearly 2.5 years, a brutal civil war between that paramilitary RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces has killed tens of thousands of people and created the largest hunger and displacement crisis in the world. Over 14 million people, more than a quarter of the population, have been displaced within and outside of Sudan, and the city El Fasher in Darfur faces famine and has for over a year. Stephanie Sy: What began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF, has escalated into a brutal civil war. But, in April, the RSF declared a parallel government based in Darfur, a large region in Western Sudan of more than seven million people that has been the site of gross atrocities for two decades. Adnan Hezam, International Committee of the Red Cross: International community, the world should be — not ignore what is happening now in Sudan, because every day there is further escalation.

Article: Call for free bus passes to help under-22s into work 51 minutes ago Share Save Emer Moreau & Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Under-22s in England should be given free bus passes to help them get into work and education, according to a report by MPs. 'We rely on public transport' Alex Mustafa Alex Mustafa, 19, says she uses the bus all the time as she can't drive due to health and financial reasons and would benefit from a free bus pass. Roman Dibden, chief executive of youth charity Rise Up, said it sees young people turn down job interviews and training all the time because they can't afford the bus fare. "Free bus passes for under-22s would remove a huge barrier, opening up access to jobs, apprenticeships, and training - especially in communities where opportunity isn't on your doorstep." 'Support people who struggle costs-wise' Dylan Lewis-Creser Dylan Lewis-Creser, 21, is a student in town planning and also stood as a Green Party candidate for Walkley Ward in the local elections in May 2024. "A free bus pass would mean I could get to and from university and work without paying £10 a week, which adds up significantly as a student on a low budget," they said. "That cost is amplified when considering changing buses to get to other job opportunities and elsewhere, like hospitals." Dylan thinks there needs to be more discussion around "making transport accessible, affordable and reliable." "Part of that would be supporting people who often struggle costs-wise to do that, such as young people," they said. "We've seen how it's boosted young people using buses in Scotland, and it only makes sense to extend that policy." Bus passengers spend £39.1 billion in local businesses every year, according to research from KPMG. The report said: "The current deregulated nature of the bus sector can encourage commercial operators to "deprioritise" less profitable routes, often leaving vulnerable communities without a service." 'Social exclusion' The committee heard that older people were particularly deterred from using the bus if they felt unsafe at bus stops. "A lot of people, we're the only people they see every week." "They become friends with the other people on their route so it's a great tool for combatting loneliness," Ms Bishop said. Stop-start funding risks losing passengers, with patronage difficult to recover if and when money is found." Steff Aquarone, a Liberal Democrat MP who sits on the Transport Committee, said the report shows the need for "a different model for rural public transport".

Article: South Korea's former first lady Kim Keon Hee has been arrested after a court late Tuesday issued a warrant to arrest her following accusations of graft that she denies, a special prosecutor leading a wide-reaching probe said. Kim is South Korea's only former first lady to be arrested, joining her husband, ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, in jail as he faces trial following his ouster in April over a botched bid to impose martial law in December. She has been accused of breaking the law over an incident in which she wore a luxury Van Cleef pendant reportedly worth more than 60 million won ($43,000) while attending a NATO summit with her husband in 2022. Kim is also accused of receiving two Chanel bags together valued at 20 million won and a diamond necklace from a religious group as a bribe in return for influence favourable to its business interests. Kim's lawyers did not immediately comment on Tuesday but they have previously denied the accusations against her and dismissed as groundless speculation news reports about some of the gifts she allegedly received.

Article: AI can make us UK's biggest firm, Rolls-Royce says 56 minutes ago Share Save Simon Jack Business editor Share Save Rolls-Royce Artist's impression of a small nuclear power station Rolls-Royce's plan to power artificial intelligence (AI) with its nuclear reactors could make it the UK's most valuable company, its boss has said. Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship".

For some, including melanoma skin cancer, 10-year survival is now above 90%, while for all cancers, half of patients can expect to live that long - double the figure in the early 1970s. But a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said there had been little improvement in those affecting the oesophagus, stomach and lungs - and less than 5% survive pancreatic cancer for 10 years. Alongside pancreatic cancer, the study says these include oesophagus, stomach and lung cancers, which all still have 10-year survival rates below 20%, after only a small amount of progress since the 1970s.

Article: Government expands police use of facial recognition vans 32 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Home Office More live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be rolled out across seven police forces in England to locate suspects for crimes including sexual offences, violent assaults and homicides, the Home Office has announced. Rebecca Vincent, interim director of Big Brother Watch, said: "Police have interpreted the absence of any legislative basis authorising the use of this intrusive technology as carte blanche to continue to roll it out unfettered, despite the fact that a crucial judicial review on the matter is pending. "The Home Office must scrap its plans to roll out further live facial recognition capacity until robust legislative safeguards are established." Charlie Whelton, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: "It's welcome news that the government will finally develop a statutory framework on the use of facial recognition, but this should be in place before more facial recognition technology is rolled out. "There's no reasonable excuse to be putting even more cameras on our streets before the public have had their say and legislation is brought in to protect all of us." The government says officers using the LFR vans will need to follow the College of Policing's guidance on the technology and the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice. It also says independent testing of the facial recognition algorithm by the National Physical Laboratory found that "the algorithm is accurate and there is no bias for ethnicity, age or gender at the settings used by the police". Chief Superintendent of South Wales Police Tim Morgan said: "We understand the concerns which are raised about the use of live facial recognition technology and we use any new technology ethically and spend time and effort making sure it's deployed in line with all legislation and guidance." The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said: "The government must also invest in comprehensive training programmes for officers to accompany this technology rollout, particularly as police forces face an unprecedented officer retention crisis." Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would "provide police with the tools they need to do their jobs".

Article: The president can only take over the district’s police for “federal purposes” during “special conditions of an emergency,” and only for 30 days at a time, under section 740 of the D.C. From the start, the lack of full self-governance for the district has been a tool for Congress and the president to exert political power over a population that has been majority Black for most of the last century. Now that same unchecked power is being exercised again, with the president openly encouraging law enforcement to “do whatever the hell they want.” History shows exactly who pays the price when that happens — Black, brown and unhoused communities. If the federal government truly cared about safety in the district, it would restore the $1 billion in local tax dollars that Congress recently blocked us from using, resulting in harmful cuts that freeze our own funds without saving the federal government a dime.

(Dominic Favre/Keystone via AP, file) FILE - A vehicle passes in front of a sign of the Vaud Cantonal Police indicating the number of driving licences withdrawn for speeding in the construction zone on the A1 motorway between Lausanne and Yverdon, Switzerland, Tuesday, June 15, 2010. (Dominic Favre/Keystone via AP, file) GENEVA -- The driver was clocked going 27 kilometers per hour (17 mph) over the speed limit on a street in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and now he's facing up to 90,000 Swiss francs (over $110,000) in fines as a result. Because the speedster, a repeat offender, is one of Switzerland's wealthiest people, and the Vaud canton, or region, serves up fines based on factors like income, fortune or general family financial situation. Back then, the Swiss safety group Road Cross said rich drivers had been lightly punished until voters approved penal law overhaul three years earlier that let judges hand down fines based on personal income and wealth for misdemeanors like speeding and drunk driving. Under today's rules, an indigent person might spend a night in jail instead of a fine, while the wealthiest in the rich Alpine country could be on the hook for tens of thousands. A court in the Swiss canton of Vaud recently ruled that the tycoon must pay 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,300) up front and could be forced to pay the rest — 80,000 more — if he's caught for a similar roadway infraction over the next three years. Switzerland's “24 Heures” newspaper first reported the case and said the man, who was not identified, was a French citizen listed by Swiss economic weekly Bilan among the 300 richest people in Switzerland — with a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The daily reported that an automated police radar photographed the offender driving at 77 kilometers per hour (48 mph) in a 50 kph (31 mph) zone on a Lausanne street. Vincent Derouand, a spokesperson for the Vaud public prosecutors office, said the defendant didn't contest the decision, which was handed down in June for the infraction nearly a year ago — in August 2024. The Vaud criminal code sets a maximum financial penalty based on the "personal and economic situation of the offender at the time of the ruling” — notably taking into account issues like income, fortune, lifestyle and family financial needs. The newspaper reported that he had already been caught for a similar speeding infraction eight years ago, and also paid 10,000 Swiss francs in penalty and faced another 60,000 if another infraction had taken place within the following two years. In Switzerland, penalties for speeding can even catch up with the cops: One officer was fined for racing at nearly twice the speed limit through Geneva streets back in 2016 while chasing thieves who had blown up a bank teller machine.

Article: (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP,File) SANTIAGO, Chile -- What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with “false flight plan data.” Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile’s prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge’s ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was “relieved by the outcome.” For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility.

Article: On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order that mandated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to implement reforms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan where one floor contains holding cells for migrants and asylum seekers. He has also instructed immigration officials to allocate 4.6 square metres (50 square feet) per person, shrinking the capacity of the largest room from 40 or more detainees to just 15. Inside the complaint The changes come in response to a complaint filed by lawyers for a Peruvian asylum-seeker named Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was taken into custody on August 8 after appearing for a scheduled court date. Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.” Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York. “I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday. While ICE has conducted high-profile raids on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings. An analysis published this week by local news outlet The City found that half of all court arrests nationwide in late May and early June took place in New York City.

Article: “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve.

Article: The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power lifted a “boil water” notice Tuesday afternoon for Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong episode that saw residents’ taps run dry or slow to a trickle. About 9,200 households in the western San Fernando Valley were affected by a water service outage that started last week after DWP workers discovered a faulty valve, according to the agency. Advertisement The valve, which was installed in 1967 and located 20 feet underground, was stuck in a nearly closed position and could not be opened, which impeded the flow of water. Advertisement The agency has a long list of recommendations, including flushing out any stagnant water by running outside plumbing; running all indoor cold-water faucets for five minutes or until the water is clear and the temperature is constant; and draining hot water tanks to remove sediment and then running hot water faucets.

Article: A suspect has been arrested in a brutal attack on a 70-year-old Sikh man who was bludgeoned with a golf club in North Hollywood earlier this month and remains unconscious and in critical condition, authorities said. Gurdial Singh Randhawa released a statement saying he was grateful that a suspect had been arrested but that he wanted more information on why the attack was not being investigated as a hate crime. Advertisement “Justice must be served, and our local Sikh community must know that the area around our gurdwara — where we gather to worship, learn, connect, eat, and serve others — is safe for all,” said Randhawa. The Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to combating violence against Sikhs in the U.S., said it was too early to rule out hate as a motive, noting that the suspect has been in custody for less than 24 hours and the victim remains unable to talk. “The reality is that elderly men in our community, especially those who maintain their Sikh articles of faith, like turbans and beards, are subjected to violent attacks far too often,” said Munmeeth Kaur, Sikh Coalition legal director, in a statement. “We are gratified that the LAPD heard the concerns of the community and acted swiftly, but it is far too early to definitively rule out bias as a potential motivation for this assault.” Advertisement McDonnell said that the North Hollywood command would be conducting extra patrols in the area following this incident and continued to engage the community in discussions around public safety concerns. Although Sikhism is a separate religion from Islam, hate crime perpetrators often conflate Muslims with anyone who looks Middle Eastern, and Sikhs with turbans and long beards are often targets.

Article: “My daughter is going to this school, and she's an athlete, representing the school, not just in Midland, but when we travel,” Mayberry said of her youngest, Erinn, a junior varsity basketball player. “What does this say to her that you want to restore a name that meant whites only?” The debate in this West Texas town echoes a renewed national debate over honoring the leaders of the Confederacy, particularly in the South. The cultural tide has shifted with President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his crusade against “wokeness.” Midland ISD Vice President Josh Guinn, elected in 2024, announced his intentions to rename Legacy High School on July 4. “Nobody wants to be a Robert E Lee.” Nearly 40 schools in Texas have retained an association with the Confederacy by name, according to data maintained by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “When you allow a little thing,” like a name, said John McAfee, one of the district’s retired teachers who taught when its classrooms were still partially segregated, “everything is affected.” Legacy Legacy High School opened in 1961. “Instead, remembering history is what should cause us to change the name of the school that was so named in a misguided attempt to honor such history at that particular time.” Later, he added: “It is also about moving forward to reflect the character of our remarkable community.” As part of the renaming process, the board established a committee to brainstorm options. “If you’re going to ask for a committee to be put together and then you don't support it, then what’s the point?” Davis’ critics angered by the name change called him a “woke liberal.” Davis, an elder and trustee of the First Presbyterian Church of Midland and a decades-long civic leader, has served in the top ranks of the local Republican party, advancing conservative causes. “He rejected his sworn oath to defend the United States, and he took up arms against the United States, and he did so to allow states to continue to enslave people, and that's just wrong.” Football The Midland Rebels, the school’s storied football team, has produced an impressive roster of players who disagree on whether their legacy hinges on the school’s name, and others who are afraid it would disappear without it. John Norman, a Midland City Council member who graduated from the school under the old name, said the school can preserve an identity it can be proud of without it. “But I’m not going to go back to a school that you stripped out from under us all and then expect us to start running back to you like you did something great, because you did nothing great for the community.” This article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/11/midland-texas-high-school-confederacy-robert-e-lee/

Article: Ivory described Nieneker as a "wild kid" in high school where this sort of act may have been "believable," but she acknowledged the 32-year-old had a history of mental health issues. "I truly hope that the people who were affected do get some kind of peace, some kind of answer," said Ivory, "It's tough when it is, what I think truly is a mental health crisis, because what what can you do? Especially again, when people seem like they're doing okay, what else can we do to avoid this in the future?" According to Ivory, Nieneker was getting sober and appeared to be doing better. That appeared not to be the case as APD sergeant Nathan Sexton detailed the 32-year-old's journey from the north Austin Target Monday afternoon where he proceeded to carjack multiple people and ended up naked and bloodied in a South Austin neighborhood stating that he was Jesus.

Train operations had been changed during pickup and drop-off after 15-year-old Milby student, Sergio Rodriguez, was hit and killed by a slow moving train in December 2024, while trying to get to school. HISD sent a statement saying in part " HISD, HISD PD, and Union Pacific remain in contact, and all questions about Union Pacific protocol should be directed to Union Pacific." ABC13 also reached out to the mayor's office. Houston Mayor Whitmire had previously been vocal about the death and the need for safety improvements, but today his office directed our request for a statement to Union Pacific and HISD. $10M in state funding has been required to build a pedestrian bridge over the train tracks near the school, but no timeline for the project has been set at this time.

A UK government spokesperson said: "Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe." The report also describes the human rights situation as having "worsened" in France and Germany. It said the response to last year's Southport attacks had been an "especially grievous example of government censorship", adding, "censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech". State department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, without naming the UK specifically, said online restrictions had targeted "disfavoured voices on political or religious grounds." "No matter really how disagreeable someone's speech may be, criminalising it or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression or polarisation," Bruce told reporters.

This week, Russia has been making fresh military advances in Ukraine, leading to a sudden thrust near the eastern town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. Putin gave the North Korean leader an update on the Alaska summit's preparation, sharing with him "information in the context of the upcoming talks with US President Donald Trump," the Kremlin said. The Ukrainian army briefly invaded Russia's Kursk region last year in an unexpected offensive that showed Western allies its capability to fight back against Russia, which currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine's territories.

Article: And the rate was the highest since 2003, which had a rate of 44 per 100,000, according to an analysis by Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans. Records dating back to the 1960s show that Washington’s homicide rate peaked in the 1990s at more than 80 per 100,000 people in 1991, or about double the rate in 2023. Trump held up a chart that first appeared on Fox News and was shared by Vice President JD Vance last week purportedly comparing Washington’s homicide rate to that of eight other “capitals.” (One, Lagos, Nigeria, is not a capital.) But the chart cites outdated data and omits several capitals and many other cities with much higher rates. Trump has a point that Washington’s homicide rate is much higher than many capitals, but its rate is nowhere near the highest “anywhere in the world.” In 2023, according to data compiled by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, capitals with higher homicide rates included Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with a rate of 67.2 per 100,000 people; Cape Town, South Africa, with 66.8; Kingston, Jamaica, with 64.2; Caracas, Venezuela, with 47.9; and Guatemala City at 47.8. Overall, the think tank reported, 47 cities with more than 250,000 people had higher homicide rates than 40.4 and 49 cities had rates higher than 39.1, including six in the United States: Memphis, New Orleans, St. According to data compiled by the city’s Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the police made about 1,500 arrests of children in 2020; 1,400 in 2021; 1,700 in 2022; 2,200 in 2023; and 2,000 in 2024. What Was Said “They know, these young gangs — or as they’re called here, crews — they know that if they’re 14, 15, 16, or 17, they’re below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree. And understand I’m not just a federal prosecutor, I’m the local D.A., so to speak here for D.C.: All of the cases go to family court and the goal of family court — the 14- through 17-year-olds — and those cases go to family court where the focus is rehabilitation and they talk about ice cream socials and yoga.” — Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. But youths arrested on other offenses can be prosecuted by the city’s elected attorney general, who prosecuted 84 percent of violent crimes committed by children in 2024, and about 73 percent of all crimes. A recent investigation by The Washington Post also found that the number of dangerous incidents at the center nearly quadrupled in recent years, and that many children are held longer than the stated goal of 30 days.

Article: National Guard troops called on to active-duty by President Donald Trump arrived at the footsteps of the Washington Monument on Tuesday as part of his plan to address what he insists is "out of control" crime in the nation's capital. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said the troops were called on to help local law enforcement with logistics support, transportation and administration duties, as well as being visible around the National Mall. Troops load boxes of rifle ammunition at the District of Columbia National Guard Headquarters as President Donald Trump implements his order to use federal law enforcement and the National Guard to expel homeless people and rid the nation's capital of violent crime, in Washington, D.C., Aug.

(DreamWorks Animation/Universal Pictures via AP) This image released by Universal Pictures shows characters, from left, Wolf, voiced by Sam Rockwell, and Diane Foxington, voiced by Zazie Beetz, in a scene from "The Bad Guys 2." (DreamWorks Animation/Universal Pictures via AP) The good news for fans of “The Bad Guys” is the new sequel is stellar. Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days — amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. “I'm just asking for a chance.” A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron — so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew — Danielle Brooks’ lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova’s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne’s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on “Poker Face.” These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever — or lazy — joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot. There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire — voice acted by Colin Jost — who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a “24-carat catastrophe.” The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. Based on Aaron Blabey’s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil — like asking if DNA determines behavior — as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. (Another thing to chew on: If “The Bad Guys 2” is a worse sequel, does that make “The Bad Guys” good?) When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a “The Bad Guys 3.” (There's going to be a “The Bad Guys 3.”) The joy of “The Bad Guys” was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like “Ocean’s 11.” This time, the “Fast & Furious” series gets mocked, as does “Silence of the Lambs,” “Men in Black” and maybe “Moonraker,” which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: “We've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!” The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers — the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time — but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag’n’Bone Man. It means the folks behind “The Bad Guys 2” reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but — c'mon, everyone — they didn't make it count.

Article: Russian President Vladimir Putin lauded the “bravery” and “heroism” of North Korean soldiers in retaking Russia’s Kursk region from Ukrainian forces during a call with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media has reported. Putin told Kim that he “highly appreciated” North Korea’s support and the “self-sacrificing spirit” displayed by its troops during the liberation of the western region, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Wednesday. Kim expressed his “heartfelt thanks” to Putin and said Pyongyang would “always remain faithful” to the spirit of the mutual defence treaty signed by the sides last year, as well as “fully support all measures to be taken by the Russian leadership in the future”, the KCNA said. “Kim Jong Un and Putin agreed to make closer contact in the future.” The call, days before Putin is set to meet United States President Donald Trump in Alaska to discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine, is the latest sign of strengthening ties between North Korea and Russia amid Moscow’s ostracisation on the world stage. “There are a lot of ifs still in the air, but the call suggests there’s a role for Russia, similar to the role South Korea played in 2018, in helping create an opening for US-DPRK relations,” Jenny Town, the director of the Korea programme at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “It might not be a focal point of the upcoming meeting but it is likely to be part of the conversation.” Advertisement Last month, Kim told Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov that Pyongyang would “unconditionally support” all actions taken by Moscow in Ukraine, according to North Korean state media reports. North Korea has deployed more than 10,000 troops to support Russia’s war and has drawn up plans to dispatch thousands more, according to assessments by South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. On Monday, he told reporters that he will probably know within the “first two minutes” of meeting Putin whether they can reach a deal and that any agreement would involve “some swapping, changes in land” between Moscow and Kyiv.

Article: The White House has ordered an extensive review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions in advance of next year’s 250th anniversary of the United States, with the goal of aligning the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of US history. In a letter sent on Tuesday to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House laid out in detail the steps it expects the organisation to take so that museum content can be reviewed for a focus on “Americanism”. The federal government will review public-facing museum content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals”, the letter said. “This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter added. At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”. Advertisement “Donald Trump’s idea that the National Museum of African American History and Culture is guilty of distorting our nation’s history or painting our ‘founding principles’ in a ‘negative light’ is patently ridiculous,” the caucus said in a statement. The White House said the review would initially focus on the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The museums under review are all located in Washington, DC, where the president this week ordered the deployment of the US National Guard to tackle a purported crime wave that city officials in the capital have refuted. The Smithsonian Institution, which runs 21 museums and the National Zoo, said at the time that the impeachment section of the museum would be updated in the coming weeks to “reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history”.

Article: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has put Israel and Russia “on notice” that their armed forces and security personnel could be listed among parties “credibly suspected” of committing sexual violence in conflict zones. The warning on Tuesday resulted from “significant concerns regarding patterns of certain forms of sexual violence that have been consistently documented by the United Nations”, Guterres wrote in a report seen by the Reuters news agency. In his annual report to the UN Security Council on conflict-related sexual violence, Guterres said that Israel and Russia could be listed next year among the parties “credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence”. In his warning to Israel, Guterres said he was “gravely concerned about credible information of violations by Israeli armed and security forces” against Palestinians in several prisons, a detention centre and a military base. “Cases documented by the United Nations indicate patterns of sexual violence such as genital violence, prolonged forced nudity and repeated strip searches conducted in an abusive and degrading manner,” Guterres wrote. Because Israel has denied access to UN monitors, it has been “challenging to make a definitive determination” about patterns, trends and the systematic use of sexual violence by its forces, he said, urging Israel’s government “to take the necessary measures to ensure immediate cessation of all acts of sexual violence, and make and implement specific time-bound commitments.” Advertisement The UN chief said these should include investigations of credible allegations, clear orders and codes of conduct for military and security forces that prohibit sexual violence, and unimpeded access for UN monitors. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel said it documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys, and accused Israeli forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. In July 2024, the Israeli military said it had detained and was questioning nine soldiers over the alleged sexual abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the infamous Sde Teiman prison facility, which was set up to detain people arrested in Gaza. Israeli media reported at the time that a Palestinian prisoner was taken to hospital after suffering severe injuries from what was an alleged gang rape by military guards at the prison. In the case of Russia, Guterres wrote that he was “gravely concerned about credible information of violations by Russian armed and security forces and affiliated armed groups”, primarily against Ukrainian prisoners of war, in 50 official and 22 unofficial detention facilities in Ukraine and Russia.

Article: Just a short walk away, diners mingle in a BYD-branded restaurant over craft beer and bar bites in a chic, members’ club-like setting – one of several lifestyle ventures the Chinese electric vehicle giant has rolled out across Singapore. The EV maker sold almost 4,670 cars – about 20 percent of total vehicle sales – during the period, according to government data, compared with about 3,460 vehicles sold by second-ranked Toyota. Singapore and Malaysia had the biggest concentration of Chinese food and beverage brands in Southeast Asia last year, according to the research firm Momentum Works, with 32 China-based firms operating 184 outlets in the city-state as of June 2024. Compared with Japanese or Korean brands, she said, Chinese chains are “creative, quick to innovate and set food trends”, though she admits it sometimes feels like they are “taking over” from local brands. For younger Singaporeans, the old stigmas around products “made in China” are fading, said Samer Elhajjar, senior lecturer at the marketing department of the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Business School. Doris Ho, who led a brand consultancy in Greater China from 2010 to 2022, said that Chinese brands have been able to succeed in Singapore with a bold, creative approach to innovation that appeals to local sensibilities. This “new China edge”, Ho said, shows up in BYD features, such as built-in fridges and spacious, fold-flat interiors that can be used for sleeping, and hotpot chain Haidilao’s extravagant hospitality, which sees customers treated to live music performances, shoeshines, hand massages and manicures. As Western firms scaled back or paused expansion, Chinese brands moved in, with many effectively propping up Singapore’s property sector and entrenching themselves in the country, said Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). “The US has acted in a miserly, resentful sort of way with ongoing trade tariffs, whereas China remains a factory of the world – seen as an economic benefactor – so there will be a swing in terms of looking at China favourably.” Chong said that Singapore has also become a virtual second home for some middle-class Chinese nationals, many of whom own property in the city-state. In a report released earlier this year by China’s Ministry of Education and the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, Singapore was ranked the second-most popular destination for Chinese students after the United Kingdom. Some analysts have observed the rise of “born-again Chinese” (BAC) – people of Chinese descent outside China, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, who embrace a strong pro-China identity, despite limited cultural or linguistic ties. Donald Low, a lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has defined so-called BACs as those who adopt an “idealised, romanticised” idea of a China that is “inevitably rising” and “stands heroically against a hegemonic West”. Some Singapore residents have felt alienated by stores that operate mainly in Mandarin Chinese, Elhajjar said, given that the city-state has one of the world’s largest immigrant populations, as well as large minorities of native-born Malays and Indians. Leong Chan-Hoong, the head of the RSIS Social Cohesion Research programme, cautioned against blaming Chinese enterprises for social tensions or rising rents, describing the inroads made by some brands as part of the natural cycle of a market-driven economy. Ly Nguyen, a 29-year-old Vietnamese migrant working in tech sales, said she started collecting Labubu, the globally popular gremlin-like toys created by Pop Mart, after being captivated by their “ugly but fun” aesthetic. For Nguyen, the popularity of Labubu dolls, which have been spotted with celebrities such as Rihanna and BLACKPINK’s Lisa, points to a generational shift in how Chinese cultural exports are viewed.

Article: JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once, rather than in phases. Arab officials told The Associated Press last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar were preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all remaining hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for ceasefire talks on Tuesday, Egypt’s state-run Qahera news channel reported, a sign that efforts have not been abandoned after 22 months of war. Israel has threatened to widen its military offensive against Hamas to the areas of Gaza that it does not yet control, and where most of the territory’s 2 million residents have sought refuge. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce. “The release of all the hostages, both alive and dead — that’s the stage we’re at.” He added, however, that Israel’s demands haven’t changed, and that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. Hamas has long called for a comprehensive deal but says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. and its humanitarian partners are doing everything possible to bring aid into Gaza, he said, but still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities that prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed. It has killed more than 61,400 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children. Israel says it struck militants disguised as aid workers In a separate development, the Israeli military said it recently struck a group of militants in Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen.

Article: Heartbreaking images of children starving in Gaza have caused what some Jewish Americans call a “rupture” between supporters of Israel’s offensive in its current form and those who oppose how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is managing the war. “We’re seeing not only divisiveness, but hatred between us, and that’s not a good thing for the future,” said Rabbi Erez Sherman of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. How do we work on that?” But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians. “Israel has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that’s really an unprecedented situation,” said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody. “Israel doesn’t want that.” Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,” he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. “To me, it’s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.” Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu’s handling of the war. Supporters of Netanyahu’s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. “All of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,” said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu’s government. But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an “existential rupture” that is pitting friends and family members against one another. “We’re wrestling with the very question ‘Do we belong to each other?’” Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.

Article: A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, affecting more than a third of the $584 million in funds the government abruptly froze late last month. 19 detailing whether it had restored the grants or, if not, “an explanation of why it was not feasible and a description of the steps that have been taken thus far.” Advertisement The case — independently filed by a group of UC professors — is the first legal test of whether massive grant suspensions at UCLA will pass court muster. The Trump administration froze $584 million in science, medical and other federal grants, citing the university’s alleged discrimination in admissions and failure to “promote a research environment free of antisemitism.” The totality of UCLA freezes cover research funded by the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy. Advertisement At question during the Tuesday hearing was whether cuts to NSF grants were illegal under Lin’s June court order that blocked science funding terminations to many UC researchers throughout the nine-campus system. UC professors funded by the NSF, Environmental Protection Agency and National Endowment for the Humanities had sued, arguing they faced cuts because their grants appeared in federal keyword searches related to race amid President Trump’s push to rid the government of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Another DOJ lawyer, Michael Velchik, argued that the grants had been cut so recently that they could not be viewed as “terminations.” “A week is certainly not enough time for this court to adjudicate that a suspension of one week is de facto a termination,” Velchik said. Lin later added: “For avoidance of doubt, the court also clarifies that grant ‘termination,’ as the term is used in the preliminary Injunction, encompasses circumstances where grant funding is cut off on a long-term or indefinite basis, like the suspensions carried out by NSF on July 30” at UCLA. The government lawyers also said the Trump administration did not freeze all grants to UCLA but spared some that were “critical” and “important.” Advertisement They did not elaborate on which or how many grants those were. Chemerinsky said that the UCLA cuts amounted to “exactly the kind of en masse terminations that the court enjoined previously.” For researchers, he said, the terms “suspension” and “termination” are the same. “There are legitimate and bona fide concerns that the government has with the conduct that has taken place at UCLA,” he said, saying the university has had “gross and horrific” antisemitism and also mentioning allegations of “racial preferences” at the UCLA medical school.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Senate Democrats walked off the Senate floor and out of the chamber on Tuesday in protest as the upper chamber began debating a proposed new congressional map that aims to give Republicans more seats in the House of Representatives. The move was primarily symbolic, as after a short debate, Texas Republicans had enough support to pass the proposed new congressional map by a 19-2 vote in the upper chamber. Even though it has cleared the upper chamber, the bills will likely die and not move forward in the House, which has been stalled for the last nine days since House Democrats broke quorum and fled the state. Some of the senators, including Roland Gutierrez (D-San Antonio) and Molly Cook (D-Houston), said they did not plan to return to the chamber to participate in debate on other bills, such as those related to the July floods, which killed more than 130 people and caused billions of dollars in damage across Texas. Jose Menendez (D-San Antonio) asked Senate President Pro Tem Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) if the upper chamber could take up the flood bills first before the redistricting, but Perry denied that, saying he wanted to save it for later in the day to end the day on a positive note. “Our options here to push back to fight in the Senate are pretty limited, so we are using every tool that we have to demonstrate our opposition.” Senate Bill 4 is identical to the map proposed by the House. The push to redraw the congressional district map follows President Donald Trump's urging of Texas Republicans to redraw the congressional districts to secure five more Republican seats in the U.S. “We have a lot of work to do to serve Texans who are desperate for flood relief and red flag orders against this national nightmare of mass shootings.” Senate Redistricting Committee Chair State Sen. “In contrast to the complications involved with race-based redistricting, this map is built on political performance, which is a well-established and permissible basis for drawing electoral districts as recognized firmly by the Supreme Court of the United States,” King said. “Race was not used to draw the map, and I did not consider race when I filed this bill, and I have not looked to any racial criteria with regard to this bill.” Democrats criticize the redraw as being conducted on racial lines. “This is just another attempt of a hostile, rogue, racist takeover of democracy being directed by the president of the United States to protect him and the Republican Party, followed through by the governor of this state,” State Sen. “We will not take part in democracy being washed out in this state of Texas.” King said his secondary goal with the proposed new map was to draw the districts more compactly. Similar to the House proposal, the main districts that see changes to give Republicans a better chance of winning are CD 9 in Houston, CD 28 in the Rio Grande Valley, CD 32 in Dallas, CD 34 along the South Texas coast and CD 35 in Central Texas. The Senate also advanced Senate Bill 13, which provides credits for cities and counties to make flood prevention fixes, and Senate Bill 43, which allows the TCEQ to issue permits for dam and reservoir repairs. “The bills that we're going to consider, they are not going anywhere because the Democrats in the House, with whom we stand in unity, are not going to cave,” state Sen. Everything we're doing right now, we are going to end up having to do again." The Texas House was once again unable to establish a quorum on Tuesday, as dozens of House Democrats remain scattered throughout other states. The governor said the second special session will include 18 items on the agenda from the current special session, such as redistricting and flood response, but could also include others. “I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed." Cook asked what took so long for Republicans to act on flood relief. “Wasting your time, wasting your money and insulting not just the people who recently died in the most horrifying way, but every single one of our communities that has lived through a hurricane, a wildfire, a tornado, a power outage or any of the other horrific scenes that we are never prepared for in this state.” This is the ninth day the Democrats have broken quorum and brought the lower chamber to a standstill. John Cornyn and Burrows – from ordering Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to conduct civil arrests if the Democrats return to Texas, to reportedly getting the FBI involved in Illinois, where many of the Democrats went when they left. Dan Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, urged Democrats to return before Friday and said if they don’t, the governor will call as many special sessions as it takes to get the bills passed. Gene Wu (D-Houston) said Democrats want to address the flooding, but if Republicans focus on redistricting again, he said, "All options are on the table." “Now, the ball is in Abbott’s court: He can stop blocking flood relief immediately. “We’re ready to help the communities that are still rebuilding from the deadliest flood Texas has seen in over 100 years.” Burrows added that he has been in constant communication with DPS, as troopers work to track down the Democrats to return them to the chamber. He said DPS is keeping track of every taxpayer dollar that has been spent in their effort to compel the Democrats' attendance, and that amount is well over six figures in DPS overtime. “If the devastation in our Hill country communities, the Texas Constitution and their mounting debt aren't enough to bring them back today, they should yet again be reminded this is not going away,” Burrows said.

Article: The 35-year-old employs about 40 workers who transform rough diamonds into perfectly polished gems for exports at the small factory in Surat, a city located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. But United States President Donald Trump’s mammoth 50 percent tariffs on imports from India might be the final nail in the coffin for his unit, part of an already struggling natural diamond industry, he said. “It is becoming increasingly difficult to pay the salaries and maintain other expenses with falling orders.” He is among the 20,000-odd small and medium traders in Surat, known as the “Diamond City of India”, which together cut and polish 14 out of every 15 natural diamonds produced globally. According to the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), India’s apex body for the industry, the country exported cut and polished gems worth $4.8bn to the US in the 2024-25 financial year, which ended in March. This is the worst phase of my two-decade-old career in diamonds.” US imposes penalty A 25 percent reciprocal tariff on all Indian goods, which Trump announced on April 2, came into effect on August 7, after talks between the two countries failed to yield a trade deal by then. He termed the additional tariff that would come into effect from August 27 as a penalty for India’s continued buying of Russian oil, as the US president tries to push Moscow into accepting a ceasefire in Ukraine. Ajay Srivastava, the founder of Global Research Trade Initiative (GTRI), a trade research group, termed the Trump government’s additional hike as an act of “hypocrisy”, citing how the US itself continues to trade with Russia, and how China – Russia’s biggest oil buyer – faces no similar penalty. “Trump is targeting India out of frustration as it refused to toe the US line on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and for its refusal to open its agriculture and dairy sector,” he added, referring to broader ongoing trade talks and differences over US demands for greater access to critical Indian economic sectors. Diamond sector badly hit More than 2 million people are employed in diamond polishing and cutting units in Surat, Ahmedabad and Rajkot cities in Gujarat — and many have already suffered salary cuts in recent years, first because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The situation in the international market led to the wages of the workers getting halved to approximately 15,000-17,000 rupees ($194) per month, which made survival difficult in the face of rising inflation,” he said. A 13,500-rupee ($154) allowance per child, to support their families, was promised in May by the state government to those who have lost jobs due to the tumult in the sector in recent years. Decline in exports In the 2024-25 financial year, India imported rough diamonds worth $10.8bn, marking a 24.27 percent decline from the $14bn imported in 2023-24, as per the statistics by the GJEPC.

Article: I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Here are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service: Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. Dietary restrictions: If you’re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service’s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs. Best overall Factor $ 67.45 $ 134.90 Factor Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: starting at $13 per serving with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 6 to 18 per week What we like Quick and easy Choice of 5 plans Seamless delivery Something to note Options can get overwhelming Get $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor’s website. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. Courtesy Mili Godio I tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient — after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Best variety CookUnity $ 46.88 $ 93.76 CookUnity Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: starting at $11 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 4 to 16 meals per week What we like Great for many dietary needs Reusable packaging Varied plans Something to note May need extra prep work Cookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. Courtesy Zoe Malin “The convenience is unbeatable — it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn’t feel limited by the menu at all,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). “This didn’t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved — if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,” says Malin. The meals are also easy to prepare: “All I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,” says Brown. Best for most dietary restrictions BistroMD $ 109.90 $ 219.80 BistroMD Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: Starting at $7 per meal for the 7-day plan and $8 per meal for the 5-day plan, with an additional $20 for shipping | Number of meals: 5 or 7 meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner per week | Serving size: single-serve What we like Meets most dietary needs Snacks available Something to note High shipping cost Only two plans BistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you’re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans — you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. The service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men’s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women’s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days. Best vegan Purple Carrot $ 79.00 $ 104.00 Purple Carrot Now 24% off What to know Type: meal kit | Cost: starting at $13 per serving for pre-made meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 6 to 10 for prepared meals per week What we like Meal kits available Great for plant-based diets All plant-based Something to note Can't choose delivery date Purple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. “The pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.” You can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Best for families Home Chef $ 55.94 $ 79.92 Home Chef Now 30% off What to know Type: meal kit | Cost: starting at $10 per meal, with a minimum weekly order value of $51 (Home Chef Plan) or $83 (Family Plan) | Serving size: 2, 4 or 6 | Number of meals: 2 to 6 meals per week What we like Customizable Great for multi-servings Personalized menu Something to note Limited pre-made options Combined with meal kits Home Chef’s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. Best gluten free Sunbasket $ 75.92 $ 115.92 Sunbasket Now 35% off What to know Type: meal kit and prepared | Cost: starting at $12 per serving for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals, with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 for meal kits, single-serve for Fresh & Ready meals | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week What we like Meal kits available Great for multiple diets Customizable Something to note Not for larger families Sunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. “There were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe — I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don’t normally buy,” she says. “And don’t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.” Best prepared and meal kit combo Blue Apron $ 31.96 $ 57.95 Blue Apron Now 45% off What to know What we like Great variety of meals Meal kits available Something to note Not for large families Lacks some variety Not for certain dietary needs Blue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. Courtesy Mili Godio I tried Blue Apron’s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I’m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. Best for healthy eaters Splendid Spoon $ 161.88 Splendid Spoon What to know What we like Snacks available Choose delivery frequency Healthier options Something to note Can’t choose number of meals Splendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. While you can’t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month. Best for sensitive stomachs Epicured $ 114.58 $ 163.69 Epicured Now 30% off What to know What we like Good for digestion issues Breakfast and dessert options Snacks available Something to note Higher price point Epicured’s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don’t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. Though there are plenty of benefits to a prepared meal delivery services, there are a few downsides to keep in mind: Most meals are single-serve: Prepared meal delivery services are ideal if you’re only feeding yourself. You may be sacrificing taste: Though many prepared services have a variety of meal options on their menu that both taste and look great, you probably won’t get the same experience as a fresh, home-cooked meal.

Article: FRISCO, Texas — A North Texas spine surgeon is performing life-saving work in the middle of one of the world’s most dangerous conflict zones, with almost nothing to work with. “Most of the injuries we are seeing are patients that have gone to aid distribution sites and have suffered gunshot wounds or are being run over by trucks,” Khaleel said. On Instagram, the doctors have documented the stories behind those injuries through the group they've formed, 'Gift of Disability Alleviation': a 12-year-old left paralyzed after being shot in the neck near an aid site, and another man struck by a tank shell in the same area are just some of the cases. The violence at aid locations is so frequent that Khaleel says, “going to the aid distribution site is known to be a risk for death or injury.” European and US doctors are primarily sharing that startling revelation while performing their volunteer work.

Article: Inside Australia's billion-dollar bid to take on China's rare earth dominance 6 hours ago Share Save Suranjana Tewari Asia Business Correspondent in Eneabba Share Save Bloomberg via Getty Images Rare earths are essential in the production of alloys for magnets Drive three hours north of Perth, and you'll arrive in Eneabba - barren and desolate, just the odd hill in the distance. And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised. Why rare earths matter The phrase "rare earths" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors - is something of a misnomer. "China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries," says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper. It comes at a cost." And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade. "This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China." The Australian government sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply," Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.

Article: Thousands of people have evacuated, schools have closed, and hundreds of flights have been cancelled as Typhoon Podul approaches southern Taiwan with wind gusts as strong as 191kph (118 mph). Podul “is strengthening”, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi said, with the typhoon on track to hit the sparsely populated Taitung County at about noon local time (04:00 GMT). After making landfall, the storm is expected to hit Taiwan’s more densely populated western coast before moving into the Taiwan Strait and towards China’s southern province of Fujian later this week. As much as 600mm (almost 24 inches) of rain has been forecast in southern mountainous areas over the next few days, the CWA said, while nine cities and counties announced the suspension of work and school, including the southern metropolises of Kaohsiung and Tainan. Taiwan’s government said that more than 5,500 people had been evacuated in advance of the typhoon’s arrival, and all domestic flights – a total of 252 – as well as 129 international routes have been cancelled, the transport ministry said. pic.twitter.com/qaeCwFg9Vu — Focus Taiwan (CNA English News) (@Focus_Taiwan) August 13, 2025 Advertisement Taiwan’s two main international carriers, China Airlines and EVA Air, said their cancellations were for routes out of Kaohsiung, with some flights from the island’s main international airport at Taoyuan stopped as well.

Article: The administration of United States President Donald Trump has circulated plans for its $175bn “Golden Dome” missile defence system, revealing a possible new missile field in the Midwest and details of the project’s plans to shoot down missiles in space, the Reuters news agency reports. According to a series of slides, titled “Go Fast, Think Big!”, presented to some 3,000 defence contractors in Huntsville, Alabama, last week, Reuters says that plans for the Golden Dome include three layers of missile interceptors, radar arrays and lasers, in addition to its space-based defences. While the presentation highlighted that the US “has built both interceptors and re-entry vehicles” for space-based missile interception before, the plans also acknowledged that the US has never built a vehicle that can handle the heat of reentry while targeting an enemy missile, according to Reuters. Reuters said the slides did not include any references to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which was part of a bid for Golden Dome contracts, alongside the software maker Palantir and defence systems manufacturer Anduril. Days after taking office on January 27, Trump signed an executive order to “immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans”. Although Trump secured $25bn for the system in his tax and spending bill, which also included significant cuts to federal funding for other programmes, including Medicaid, the project still faces a significant funding shortfall.

Article: Wife of South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon arrested over corruption allegations toggle caption Jung Yeon-je/AP via AFP SEOUL, South Korea — The wife of South Korea's jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol has been arrested as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate. The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul's new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. While Yoon's self-inflicted downfall extended a decades-long run of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations. The investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, initially questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest. Kim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week's questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as "someone insignificant." Investigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Sponsor Message Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company. Min's investigation team arrested one of Kim's close associates earlier Tuesday following his arrival from Vietnam, as they look into suspicions that he used his connection to the former first lady to secure millions of dollars in business investments for his financially struggling company. The investigators also raided a construction company on Monday over allegations that its chairman purchased a luxury necklace reportedly worth $43,000, which they believe was the same one Kim wore while accompanying Yoon on a 2022 trip to Europe. Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon's martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident the liberals claim Yoon's government tried to cover up. Sponsor Message Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month following a March release and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, has repeatedly resisted investigators' attempts to compel him to answer questions about his wife.

Article: Thirteen children died after falling from windows in six years 17 minutes ago Share Save Meghan Owen, Tarah Welsh & Naresh Puri BBC News Share Save Family pic One-year-old Exodus Eyob died when he fell from a seventh floor window in Leeds in 2022 Thirteen children have died in falls from windows in their rented or temporary accommodation in England since 2019, according to a study into fatalities of very young and primary-school age children. The National Housing Federation, which represents England's housing associations, told us that social landlords have increased the number of checks they do to make sure buildings are "compliant with current regulations and safety requirements". Windows in the Leeds flat where Exodus Eyob lived were not defective, ruled an inquest The 13 children in the NCMD report were all aged under 11, and died between April 2019 and the end of May 2025. One of the children who died was Exodus Eyob, who was a year old when he fell out of an open window from the seventh floor of a Leeds tower block in 2022. The lawyer who represented his family at his inquest, Gareth Naylor, tells the BBC that in a "split second" of an adult leaving the room, the toddler climbed on a bed and fell. "What they ignored during [Exodus's] inquest is that these apartments are tiny, and the bed can only go under the window." If children are housed in towers, believes Mr Naylor, "a mesh or a guard" should be added for protection. Other fatalities include five-year-old Aalim Ahmed, who fell in May 2024 from the kitchen window of a social housing flat on the 15th storey of an east London tower block - and two deaths this year of two-year-olds, one in Gloucestershire and the other in south London. Tracey McGurk is worried about the safety of her windows when her grandchildren visit The number of deaths in the NCMD study is "very distressing" says the social housing watchdog, the Housing Ombudsman Service. One resident in Fulham uses duct tape to try to make their windows safer Examples from the watchdog's report include a mother unable to close some of her windows properly for four years, a window coming loose from its frame in a baby's room, and residents using duct tape to hold windows together. Duct tape is also how one council tenant in west London told us he had tried to make his windows safer, because he was so worried about his nine-year-old daughter. The tenant, who lives on the Lancaster Court Estate in Fulham, also says at one point, broken handles, which the council said were unfixable, meant a window was stuck open for a week during the winter. In total, we spoke to a dozen residents on the estate, which is owned by Hammersmith and Fulham Council, and saw that visibly broken windows without handles were a widespread problem, as well as mould around window frames. "We're investing more than £1m every week to refurbish and repair our ageing housing stock," a spokesperson for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said, "part of a bold, three-year strategy that includes replacing every window that has reached the end of its life." The council is "not just meeting the housing ombudsman's window safety standards, we're exceeding them," they added. "Replacing windows can be complex and costly," says Richard Blakeway, "but there can be no justification for the conditions some residents have endured." Rise in hospital admissions At Manchester Royal Infirmary, more than double the number of children attended with major trauma from a window fall between April and June this year, than in any similar period since 2020, the BBC has been told. A lot of the families said they knew the window was broken, or would not lock, and that no action had been taken despite reporting it to a landlord, says Dr Mottershead. Pre-school children are particularly susceptible to falls because of their lack of awareness of danger - and because their bodies are top heavy - says the Child Accident Prevention Trust says. A government consultation on how to improve standards in both private and socially rented homes is currently taking place - and it is looking at how to ensure that all rented homes in England have child-resistant restrictors on any windows that present a fall risk.

Article: A federal judge will hear closing arguments in a hearing over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws MIAMI -- A federal judge is set to hear closing arguments Wednesday over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a two-week halt on new construction last Thursday as witnesses continued to testify in a hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe want Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction, which they say threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration. Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday who testified that the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers. Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles executive director David Kerner testified that the 1,800 state troopers under his command are authorized to detain undocumented migrants under an agreement with the U.S. He said the federal government doesn't tell the state where to detain immigrants, and that the Everglades facility was built to alleviate overcrowding at federal immigration detention facilities, as well as state and county facilities with agreements to hold federal immigration detainees. Kerner couldn't say how many of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detainees have been charged with violent crimes or whether any other sites besides the middle of the Everglades were considered for possible detention centers. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit because the detention center is in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) FILE - Crosses are surrounded by flowers and other mementos at a memorial, June 9, 2022, for the victims of a shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Newly released records surrounding the May 2022 massacre, including hundreds of pages of files and hours of body camera video, show in greater detail the heartbreak and failures of one the worst school shootings in U.S. The official narrative that police quickly rushed to confront and kill 18-year-old gunman Salvador Ramos had been quickly dismissed by parents who stood outside the school begging for officers to go inside or let them get to their children. As he donned his ballistics vest, a voice says, “Something needs to be done, ASAP.” After some children run from the school and officers report finding an AR-15 rifle, one officer can be heard saying, “We need to get in there, fast.” It would be another hour before law enforcement breached the classroom and killed Ramos. She told deputies Ramos never hit her, but they made a note in their report: “Ms Reyes stated she was scared of Salvador and wanted help.” Ramos’ grandmother took him to her house and deputies took no further action. In October 2021 — seven months before the shooting — Ramos withdrew from high school because of “poor academic performance, lack of attendance.” Records showed he failed nearly all his classes. Crouched behind the school building sizing up an assault on the classroom from the outside, an officer says, “I just don’t want to be crawling and he’s just looking down on me.” Former school police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been described as the incident commander, can be heard shouting to Ramos, asking him put down his weapon. Once police realized there were children hiding in other classrooms, Arredondo is heard telling officers crouched around him they want to clear those rooms before breaching the classroom where Ramos is holed up. “We're gonna save the lives of the other ones.” The law enforcement response included local, state and federal officers, but Arredondo and former school district police officer Adrian Gonzales are the only two to face criminal charges. ___ Associated Press reporters John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri; Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia; and Ed White in Detroit contributed.

Article: Officials in a rural Tennessee town have voted to approve agreements to turn a former state prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious pub... -- Officials in a rural Tennessee town voted Tuesday to approve agreements to turn a former state prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting. The five-member Board of Alderman in Mason, plus Mayor Eddie Noeman and Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, met in a fire station garage to discuss converting the closed West Tennessee Detention Facility into a U.S. Also present were a few dozen vocal, angry members of the public who oppose allowing ICE to house immigrants in Mason who have been taken into custody as President Donald Trump pushes for mass deportations. The first vote of the meeting resulted in approval for a contract with CoreCivic to resume operating the facility, which was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with private detention facilities. Noeman, an Egyptian-American immigrant and a longtime business owner in the town, called turning the closed prison over to CoreCivic and ICE a “win-win situation,” which led to a cascade of loud boos. “It's nothing personal about any immigrant,” Noeman said, adding moments later that “to give jobs to the people is what I'm looking for.” At times, Noeman argued with attendees, questioning whether they actually live in Mason and telling them “you don't know what you're talking about.” Before the meeting, board member Virginia Rivers told The Associated Press that she does not support turning the prison into an ICE facility because “I don't like what ICE stands for, how they treat the people.” During the meeting, she noted that some immigrants without criminal records are being swept up by immigration agents and separated from their families. She said approving the contracts would make Mason “complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.” “We as officials of the town of Mason that were elected by the citizens should consider the consequences and the hurt that this would cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools and many families,” Rivers said. CoreCivic said in a statement that the ICE facility would create nearly 240 new jobs, and it is currently advertising openings for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour. The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company said. “The services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,” CoreCivic said. “How is it that we can consistently let these organizations come into Black communities and then just somehow overwhelm us with the few dollars that they throw on the table as crumbs while they take the majority of the take back to wherever they came from?” Watkins said. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment — including at least 22 inmate deaths — at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.

Article: An American paediatrician who volunteered in the Gaza Strip says the injuries inflicted on Palestinian aid seekers at sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) suggest that Israeli forces there shot the men and boys deliberately, by targeting and maiming specific body parts on specific days. Ahmed Yousaf made the comments to Al Jazeera from the Jordanian capital, Amman, on Tuesday, hours after returning from Gaza, where he had spent two and a half weeks working at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Deir el-Balah and al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “Meaning on a given day, say Monday, we’d get 40,60 patients coming in at a given time, and they would all be shot in the legs, or in the pelvic area, or the groin on a given day, just kind of a similar pattern. And what it felt like, at least for me, the position that I went with, was that somebody behind the gun that day was going to choose the way they were either going to maim or decide to kill people,” he said. “It was age indiscriminate.” Yousaf’s comments are the latest by medical staff in Gaza that accuse Israeli forces and US contractors of targeted and indiscriminate violence at the GHF sites. Advertisement Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said last week that the GHF-run food distributions in famine-stricken Gaza have become sites of “orchestrated killing and dehumanisation“, while Human Rights Watch said the shootings amount to serious violations of international law and war crimes. ‘All of Gaza is a death trap’ Yousaf, the US paediatrician, said the victims at the sites were mainly boys and young men, as they are often the ones taking the risk to try to get food for their families, “given the dynamic of the risk associated with trying to carry a 5-pound [2.3kg] bag of flour, maybe kilometres, sometimes”. It seemed quite obvious to them and to us, from a pattern-recognition perspective, in terms of who came to the ER [emergency room], that on a given day, whoever was making the decision behind the trigger was choosing a very specific pattern of fire,” he said. “And this resulted in a situation in which, when those patients came in, in different stages of dying, screaming in pain for their mothers… we knew that in any other environment, we could have done something for them, but in the environment of Gaza, in the death trap that is Gaza completely, we were unable to give them the aid that they deserve, to provide the human dignity and humanity that they deserve.”

Article: During earnings calls last week, executives with the firms Geo Group and CoreCivic announced an increase in revenue from new and current contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and discussed their plans to expand their businesses to meet the administration's demands. "We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions." CoreCivic reported a total revenue of $538.2 million during their second quarter, a 9.8% increase from the same quarter in 2024. During the call, Hininger told investors the company is evaluating additional opportunities for expansion and said that CoreCivic facilities are "the most humane, most efficient logistically, have the highest audit compliance scores in their system, and are more secure [and] weatherproof." Hininger said that while ICE has recently been using "soft-sided solutions" like the tent facilities at Guantanamo Bay and at Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, he believes the agency "does not see soft-sided facilities as long-term solutions." "In the days since the election, the message has been pretty darn clear from the administration, DHS leadership, and ICE leadership that detention is going to be the priority," Hininger said, adding that the company has been "working around the clock" to open up bed space and new detention facilities. During their earnings call last week, Geo Group Chairman George Zoley said the utilization of their current ICE contracts increased from 15,000 beds to 20,000 beds, which Zoley said is the highest level of ICE utilization in the company's history. The Geo Group CEO told investors that "given the size" of the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S., the company's view is that in addition to increased detention capacity, the "enforcement of federal immigration laws" could lead to an increase in GPS tracking for individuals. "We believe we've taken the necessary resources to significantly and quickly respond to the eventual expansion of [the] Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (ISAP)." ICE has for years relied on private companies to house detained migrants, making it a multimillion-dollar business. As ABC News has previously reported, Geo Group and CoreCivic --- both of whose leadership have long supported Trump --- saw their stock prices immediately spike after Trump's victory in the November election.

Trump has said any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" and it is believed one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands is that Kyiv surrenders the parts of the Donbas it still controls. A Russian summer offensive has been progressing with troops making a sudden thrust near the eastern town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. While downplaying Russia's advance, Zelensky said it was "clear to us" that Moscow's objective was to create a "certain information space" before Putin meets Trump that "Russia is moving forward, advancing, while Ukraine is losing". Moscow now holds almost all of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk but speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would reject any proposal to leave the Donbas. Zelensky has previously insisted that Ukrainians would not "gift their land to the occupier", and pointed to the country's constitution, which requires a referendum before a change in its territory. Last week, Trump said there would be "some swapping of territories to the betterment of both" Russia and Ukraine - sparking concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Moscow could be allowed to redraw Ukraine's borders by force.

Nicholas Rossi is alleged to have attacked the woman at his apartment in Orem, Utah, in September 2008 after she went to retrieve money he stole from her to buy a computer. The second day of a trial covering the Salt Lake County assault on a woman, known as MB, is taking place at the Third Judicial District Court in Salt Lake County. She said she spent time at Rossi's apartment in Orem, about 40 miles (66km) from Salt Lake City, and sometimes slept there during the day as she had a job working at night. She told the court on one occasion, she woke up at Rossi's apartment to find he had spent up to $400 (£296) on a computer using her credit card details without permission. 'Belittling' The relationship ended after about four weeks at the start of September 2008, which the woman put down to Rossi's "belittling" of her and suggesting she needed "mental help". She said he then began performing a sex act on himself and when she tried to leave, Rossi pulled her clothing down and pinned her to a couch or other piece of furniture before raping her. In it, Rossi alleged the woman had, on six to eight occasions, "forced him down and kissed him regardless of him saying 'no'." He also claimed the woman would force him to have sexual intercourse and "forcefully engage him into sexual acts" under the guise of "getting her money back".

Article: This week, I look at how the World Robot Conference put China's ambitions for humanoid robots on full display, even as engineers and investors acknowledge that integrating them into everyday life is still a distant prospect. BEIJING, CHINA - AUGUST 10: Unitree Robotics robots humanoid robots compete in a boxing match during the 2025 World Robot Conference (WRC) at Beiren Yichuang International Convention and Exhibition Center on August 10, 2025 in Beijing, China. At the World Robot Conference in Beijing, which concluded Tuesday, the mood was a blend of optimism and caution: Businesses showed off increasingly lifelike humanoid robots even as they conceded that technological gaps keeping these machines from mainstream usage remain wide. Some tasks like using a robot to make a bed are still in the "very early" stage, with low success rate, Huang said, "but that's the right direction to push the industry forward." Take PsiBot's mahjong-playing droid displayed at the event: It still misidentifies tiles, often confuses the game's rules and plays at a relatively slow pace, according to local media reports. The technological bottleneck for large-scale integration of humanoids into daily life stems from a lack of cutting-edge AI models and insufficient training data, said Bob Chen, economist at Shanghai-based FG Venture. players seem to shoot for the holy-grail solution." In robot manufacturing, Tesla's humanoid project Optimus appears to be leading in the U.S., with CEO Elon Musk saying the company plans to produce about 5,000 units this year. While Musk's ambitious plans could give it a leg up on other American competitors that have yet to hit the mass market, Chinese companies have been racing to make their models more affordable. In the lead up to the WRC, Unitree rolled out its third version of R1 model, priced at 39,900 yuan ($5,249) on e-commerce site JD.com, significantly cheaper than the its other models. At the conference, prices for a humanoid robot ranged from tens of thousands of yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and the high-end models capable of more complex tasks were priced above 500,000 yuan. China already has an edge in integrating machinery into factory workflows and, in many cases, is outpacing rivals in marrying artificial intelligence with robotics, said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of China-focused economic research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. Kroeber predicts that within two to four years, Chinese factories will achieve major efficiency gains across industries by combining top-tier industrial robots with AI systems that make them far more effective in varied settings. Some of UBTech Robotics' humanlike droids have been deployed at factories of carmakers BYD and Geely, at electronics manufacturer Foxconn and logistics giant SF Delivery, Chinese state media reported in April.

Article: 'I cleared my £13,000 debt with TikTok earnings' 3 hours ago Share Save Helen McCarthy BBC News, Leicester Share Save BBC Roxanne Freeman built up her online following while working as a slimming consultant "This has been the turning point for me - it's improved my confidence, my own self-belief." Single mum Roxanne Freeman says she lived beyond her means and used her credit cards to support her family, even using one to put down a deposit on a caravan. She had racked up £13,000 worth of debt by summer 2023, but her fortunes changed after she turned her hand to content creation, filming and posting reviews of plus-size clothing on TikTok. Roxanne is among a growing number of people turning to social media to boost their income and says: "It's literally life-changing." Roxanne says she can now afford to do more with her sons Roxanne was working as a Slimming World consultant when she bought a dress from TikTok Shop and filmed herself trying it on before posting a review for her 1,000 followers in February 2024. She says she earned £200 in commission from the dress manufacturer in a week - 10% for each one bought via the link she posted with her video - and was soon approached by other companies offering her samples to review. "I'm now earning up to £5,000 per month from just two to three hours' work a day, it's insane." 'Imposter syndrome' Roxanne, who now has almost 50,000 followers, has since left her slimming consultant job and relies solely on her income from TikTok. She says her earnings vary each month depending on her followers, but she has earned enough to pay off her debts and to do more with her sons, aged six and 10. "Sometimes imposter syndrome does sneak in a little bit and I worry, but you could lose any job tomorrow." Holly and Diego Hernandez's TikTok account has almost 300,000 followers Like Roxanne, married couple Holly and Diego Hernandez also earn money by posting videos on TikTok. Holly, from Leicester, and Diego, from Mexico, met on the social media platform when they were 16 and went on to set up an account to document their relationship and daily life. The couple now have almost 300,000 followers and earn up to £5,000 a month, but they have both kept their day jobs - Holly, 22, is a nurse and Diego, 23, works for a medical supply company. To be eligible, creators must be 18 or older, have 10,000 followers or more and have had at least 100,000 video views in the 30 days before applying to join the fund. Diego and Holly have both kept their day jobs Holly says: "We were so young when the money came in, and we were going on amazing holidays and buying things. "Things like taxes came into play, so we ended up getting an accountant and becoming a limited company." The couple post videos most days but admit there are negatives to sharing their lives so openly. "It can get to you when it's constant." Estelle Keeber says "influencer marketing is here to stay" Estelle Keeber, also from Leicester, started a Facebook group aimed at female business owners in 2017 and, after gaining a large following, started charging for her social media expertise. "Nobody wants to be sold to, whereas when it's organic, people trust and believe in that person - and the bigger brands are really understanding this now." 'Big, fat juicy tax bill' According to Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform, there are 54 million social media users in the UK and 84% of adults follow an influencer.

The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that still it controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Trump has also routinely threatened and cajoled his NATO allies over defense spending, and has shown little mercy in trade talks by hiking tariffs on most EU imports to 5%, ostensibly for U.S.

Article: (COMBO) This combination of pictures created on February 21, 2020 shows US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 19, 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. President Donald Trump will approach his encounter with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as a "listening exercise," the White House said, taming expectations that this week's Alaska summit could yield a deal to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "And so this is for the president to go and, again, to get a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end." The shift to downplaying the Friday meeting between the two heads of state — which will take place at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, according to NBC News reporting — takes place as Russia has deepened its advance in eastern Ukraine, in a likely bid for battlefield leverage ahead of negotiations. Moscow has persisted on a set of maximalist conditions to cease the devastating war in Ukraine, including the retainment of occupied territories, Kyiv's renunciation of its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and fresh elections in the invaded country. Concerns have been growing in Kyiv and among its European allies that an increasingly frustrated Trump, who has criticized both Russia and Ukraine over the course of the U.S.-brokered discussions, could push through peace at the price of territorial concessions. Trump on Monday circulated the notion of "land swapping" between the parties at war, although it remains unclear what Russian territories would be affected as part of this exercise, given Kyiv's lack of land gains. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the possibility of surrendering ground — with the European Union likewise touting the need to respect "territorial integrity" — and has insisted that Kyiv should be included in peace conversations aiming for a final outcome. "So the conversation between Putin and Trump may be important for their bilateral track, but they cannot agree on anything about Ukraine without us." Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas lambasted Putin as "just pretending to negotiate" and stressed the Kremlin leader "doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions." Benjamin Godwin, partner at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, on Wednesday told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" that the premise of land swapping had diminished the odds of success of the Alaska summit. "I think this all comes down to the fact that the entire basis for this meeting is based on something that is totally impossible for both the Ukrainians and the Europeans and really, the Americans to agree to," he said. "So what you see from Karolin Leavitt is really the White House reeling back and back and back these expectations in the days leading up to the meeting." He noted that the best outcome for Ukraine would involve Putin overstepping the mark by way of excessive demands and kindling further frustration at the White House. It seems very difficult." The White House has signaled but so far resisted the impulse to directly confront the Kremlin by way of further sanctions, instead opting to apply pressure on Moscow's lingering trade partners.

"We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism," ministers of the three countries — using an acronym that describes the European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal — said in a letter obtained by the FT. They were designed to act as a guardrail: if Iran commits a "significant non-performance" of the deal, any of the JCPOA signatory countries can trigger the automatic reimposition of U.N. Those sanctions are set to expire on October 18 unless one of the remaining parties of the deal — Russia, China, or a member of the E3 — triggers the snapback option. "'Snapback' looks set to be the word of the summer in European negotiations with Iran," Ellie Geranmayeh, Deputy Director, Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a July report.

Article: Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about forcibly relocating Palestinians from Gaza to the East African country, according to six people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press. The proposal is part of an Israeli effort to displace Palestinians from Gaza – a move human rights groups warn would amount to forcible expulsion, ethnic cleansing, and would violate international law. Critics of the transfer plan fear Palestinians would never be allowed to return to Gaza and that mass departure could pave the way for Israel to annex the enclave and re-establish Israeli settlements there, as called for by far-right ministers in the Israeli government. South Sudan has struggled to recover from a civil war that broke out shortly after independence in 2011, killing nearly 400,000 people and leaving parts of the country facing famine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said he wants to advance what he calls “voluntary migration” for much of Gaza’s population, a policy he has linked to previous statements of United States President Donald Trump. “I think that the right thing to do, even according to the laws of war as I know them, is to allow the population to leave, and then you go in with all your might against the enemy who remains there,” Netanyahu said Tuesday in an interview with i24, an Israeli TV station. South Sudanese civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AP that the country “should not become a dumping ground for people … and it should not accept to take people as negotiating chips to improve relations”. According to Szlavik, the country wants the Trump administration to lift a travel ban and remove sanctions on some South Sudanese elites, suggesting the US could be involved in any agreement about the forcible displacement of Palestinians. The Trump administration has previously pressured several countries to accept deportations, and South Sudan has already taken in eight individuals removed from the US under the administration’s mass deportation policy.

Lee and Ishiba previously met on the sidelines of the June G7 meetings in Canada, where they called for building a future-oriented relationship and agreed to cooperate closely on various issues including trade and countering North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. South Korea’s previous conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, made active efforts to repair ties with Tokyo, including a major compromise on compensation issues related to Korean victims of Japanese wartime slavery, aiming to bolster trilateral security cooperation with Washington against North Korean threats. But Yoon’s presidency was cut short by his brief imposition of martial law in December, which led to his ouster and imprisonment, leaving uncertainty over Seoul-Tokyo relations under Lee, who has long accused Japan of clinging to its imperialist past and hindering cooperation. Since taking office in June after winning the early presidential election, Lee has avoided thorny remarks about Japan, instead promoting pragmatism in foreign policy and pledging to strengthen Seoul’s alliance with Washington and trilateral cooperation with Tokyo. There also have been calls in South Korea to boost collaboration with Japan in responding to Trump, who has unsettled allies and partners with tariff hikes and demands they reduce reliance on the U.S.

Article: In an era in which technology has encroached on every aspect of umpiring — replay review, near-daily lowlight videos of bad calls going viral, and now, MLB's automated-ball-strike system that calculates the location of a pitch to within a fraction of an inch — the pressure on umpires is higher than ever, MLB officials say. That's the most important thing." toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR A day at umpire camp The pool of hopefuls in this camp ran the demographic gamut: mostly — but not all — men, of all ages, skin colors, hometowns and experience levels. But more than anything, O'Connor said, getting the little things right can help an umpire project what he called "field presence." Sponsor Message "You got to look like you know what you're doing," O'Connor told them. "Those two dugouts, you've got to prove to them you know what you're doing." toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR How technology is changing umpiring Dealing with pressure has always been part of an umpire's job. "The umpiring now is better than it ever has been by a mile," said Jim Reynolds, an MLB umpire supervisor who worked the major leagues for 24 years, including two World Series. Now, what might be the biggest change for major league umpires is on deck: MLB is testing a camera-based system known as ABS, or automated ball-strike, that can tell instantly whether a pitch is in the strike zone. toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR An ABS challenge system could be coming to the big leagues before long, in which players will be able to challenge balls and strikes when they disagree with the umpire's call. Sponsor Message "When you walk on a big league field — I don't care if you're a player, an umpire or a coach — confidence is the most important thing. One of the things we're going to have to monitor with our guys, and one of the things they're going to have to overcome, is this eroding of confidence in real time," Reynolds said. It has already changed MLB's umpire development process, said Cris Jones, who supervises umpires in Triple-A, the highest level of the minor leagues, where ABS has been in testing for several years. Now, they must also recover from getting their calls overturned — especially with the ABS challenge system, where there can sometimes be 10 or more challenges in a single game, because teams can challenge as many calls as they like so long as they are successful in overturning the umpire's calls. "The mental part is what I'm afraid of with some of these umpires that get overturned, and the frequency that they get overturned, or the frequency that they get challenged." At spring training earlier this year, players described to NPR what it was like when that happened. But I also think that the goal of this profession is to be perfect, so we should want to be perfect anyway," said Leo Dlatt, 21, who came from the Chicago area to attend the camp. He alluded to this year's All-Star Game, during which the ABS challenge system was in effect and was used in the first inning to turn a 1-2 ball call into a 0-3 strikeout.

"So all of the potatoes that we eat," she continues, "the ones that are red, the ones that are little like this, the big ones, the ones we make into chips, all of those are one species we've domesticated that's gone worldwide."

"If there's a plant that can invade and take advantage, then off it goes." The potato's successful exploitation of the alpine habitat was likely made possible by its tubers, which could store energy and persist in the newly made mountains, biding their time until the conditions become more favorable. "And you can generate more species to adapt [to] changeable environments." Knapp adds, "Hybridization is a real force in evolution that allows for the release of variation, which allows diversification and evolution to happen." Of course, not all interbreeding events have produced results as wildly successful as the potato.

Article: The law suggests not toggle caption Real America's Voice/via YouTube/Kari Lake's YouTube page By the close of business Wednesday, Trump administration official Kari Lake must explain to a federal judge how she intends to ensure that Voice of America fulfills its congressional mandate to serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news overseas despite forcing out nearly the entire workforce. While she has gone by a series of shifting titles involving the designation "senior adviser," an official agency record recently called Lake the "Acting Chief Executive Officer" of Voice of America's federal parent, the U.S. A government role has to be "defined and documented" Although the question of what job Lake holds may seem a bit in the weeds, it could have ramifications for the legality of the decisions she has made in leading the agency. "The government does not operate on the whims of a Kari Lake or even of a Donald Trump," says Norman Eisen, who served as special counsel for ethics to then-President Barack Obama. Eisen, an attorney who is the co-founder of Democracy Defenders Fund, is representing press advocacy groups in current lawsuits against Lake over the actions she has taken at Voice of America. One way or the other, this raises the most profound legal questions." In an earlier case, a federal judge voided directives tightening asylum rules in 2020 after finding that Trump's appointment of the acting director of U.S. There's so many things that may come back to haunt Kari Lake and USAGM." "Maybe she just wants to have a cool title to wave around," Turner says, "but if she really doesn't have true legal authority to have that title, then they're really just begging for problems." Unclear that Lake is eligible to be acting CEO Lake is a former local Phoenix television news anchor turned two-time unsuccessful MAGA candidate for senator and governor in Arizona. In March, Lake named a senior agency official, Victor Morales, to be the acting chief executive; in early July, according to two people with knowledge, she was elevated to be deputy CEO but continued to run the agency. (They spoke on condition of anonymity due to fears of professional repercussions.) She then forced Morales out in late July, which is when she began to be referred to as acting CEO both inside and outside the vastly diminished agency. Sponsor Message The federally funded international broadcaster has — until this year — broadcast news in 49 languages, reaching lands where a free press is either under duress from authorities or not financially viable. Lake identified as acting CEO on TV appearance and in official document Yet that's how the right-wing cable channel Real America's Voice identified Lake in a July 31 segment she posted Sunday on her own YouTube page. 1, the agency itself called her the "Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM" twice in a letter to Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz informing him that it intended to fire him. The judge is overseeing a group of related lawsuits against Lake and the government filed by Abramowitz as well as other Voice of America journalists, an agency official, unions and press advocacy groups. (Abramowitz's attorney declined to comment.) Under federal statute, the Voice of America director "may only be appointed or removed if such action has been approved by a majority vote" of the advisory board. Justice Department wrote that the administration had the power to dismiss Abramowitz for previously refusing to accept a transfer to a shortwave radio facility in North Carolina from the network's headquarters in Washington, D.C. "This would create an additional argument for anybody she fired or any other acts she engaged in, including entering into contracts." A revolving door of chief executives as Lake oversees agency Then-President Joe Biden's CEO, Amanda Bennett, resigned on the day of Trump's second inauguration in January. (Bozell has instead been nominated to be Trump's ambassador to South Africa.) Sponsor Message Initially, the agency's chief financial officer, Roman Napoli, served as acting chief executive, followed by Morales in March. Until late July, Lake's own title was "senior adviser" — though, as NPR has previously reported, it has variously been rendered as senior adviser for the administration, for the agency, for the agency's chief operating officer (a position the agency does not currently have) and, in a court filing in late June, "senior advisor to the acting CEO." The government's legal filings on Wednesday in response to Judge Lamberth's demand for more information from Lake about her plans for Voice of America may shed more light on what job she has.

Article: "The most everyday, commonplace words are often the most mysterious," said Colin Gorrie, a linguist who has written about the origin of "dog." Descended from wolves, dogs were among the first animals to be domesticated, and their close bond with humans can be traced back thousands of years. Much like the animal itself, the word used to describe canines has evolved over time; "dog" only became the standard term within the past 500 years or so, according to Gorrie. "I think what the source of it is — is the fact that dogs live with us so much and we have such an emotional association with dogs, they become parts of our family and they attract these kinds of pet names." From insult to standard pet name Centuries ago, dogs were more commonly called "hounds" — a term derived from the Old English word "hund." Today, "hound" typically refers to a specific breed of dog, but back then, it referred to all domestic canines, according to Gorrie. "So not just in the history of English but in related languages of Europe and Asia." Over time, the positive emotions people felt toward the four-legged creature eclipsed some of the word's negative, derogatory charge, he said. " Almost as if they're reclaiming that word or using it ironically to show just how strong the affection is." Since "dog" became ubiquitous, it has continued to broaden in meaning. That's also true for common words such as "boy" and "she," as well as animal-related ones like "pig" and "hog." " There are theories about some of them," Gorrie said. "But dog is the one that's the real mystery." Why dogs are a popular source for idioms The term "dog" has also borne a range of sayings, such as "dog days of summer," "dog-eat-dog world," and "raining cats and dogs." People tend to use what's ordinary in their day-to-day lives as sources of metaphors and idioms. The same goes for "dog tag." " Sometimes we put on a dog a collar so that we know who it belongs to so that it can be taken back to the right person," he said. "Well, if you go in the military, you wear a little collar like a dog does, and we call them dog tags." Nilsen added that many of these idioms stem from humans' close observations of dogs' behavior and mannerisms — showing just how close the two are.

Article: So the little light at the end of the tunnel for these people who have been following the American dream and playing by all the rules is increasingly being snuffed." Sponsor Message The Chelmsford Immigration Court opened last year as a way to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court, which used to process immigration cases for much of New England. The Trump administration's twin efforts to downsize the federal government and increase immigration arrests are colliding in the immigration system, where immigration courts are run as part of the civil service inside the Department of Justice — apart from the judicial branch, which controls other federal courts. toggle caption Meredith Nierman/NPR/NPR Postponed day in court The loss of court judges and staff throws a wrench in the already-limited due process afforded to immigrants seeking relief from deportation, former employees at Chelmsford and lawyers said. "But at least they'll have a chance to have their case heard before a judge who is going to treat them fairly and get some sort of reasoned decision out of it." Sponsor Message But Marzouk and Born said instead of getting their day in court, their clients are seeing cases postponed by years — even as far out as 2029. "Whatever date I got today, it will definitely be rescheduled again because at this point, there are not enough judges in that court to address the amount of people and cases," said Diecelis Escano, another attorney with cases at Chelmsford. On July 18, a week after the latest round of dismissals, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency immigration courts are in, posted an immigration judge vacancy announcement , which includes Chelmsford as a location. "Under this Administration, the total pending caseload of immigration court cases has fallen by more than 391,000 cases ," she said, "and EOIR will continue to use all of its resources to adjudicate immigration cases fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly consistent with due process." Boston is an immigration hotspot The Chelmsford court is part of a region already feeling pressure from not having enough immigration judges. It's one of 18 cities the Department of Homeland Security recently labeled a "sanctuary jurisdiction" that "impede enforcement of federal immigration laws." Immigration lawyers report a growing number of cases that are often time-sensitive. "The court will be there physically, but there will be no judges to hear the cases," union president Matt Biggs said about what could happen if the downsizing trend continues. Tucked in a corner on the second floor is the name plate for Nancy Griffiths, an immigration judge who left her decades-long job as a judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and moved from Phoenix to work at Chelmsford. Leaving thousands of cases behind Former Judge Angela Munro received the email in April notifying her that her employment would be terminated and placed on administrative leave — just a few days shy of the end of her two-year probationary period. "But I also knew in my mind that I was doing a good job and that immigration judges are supposedly needed." Munro had about 4,000 cases on her docket, she said, and had completed about 1,000. "Any immigration judge can hear any case at any time, and adjudicating detained immigration cases remains a high priority for the agency," Mattingly, the EOIR spokesperson, said in response to questions about judges being moved. toggle caption Brian Snyder/REUTERS Backlogs grow as EOIR dismisses judges As more people have been placed in detention, and judges have been dismissed, EOIR has strained with the pressure of keeping up with cases. Sponsor Message Griffiths, the judge who moved from Phoenix, noted that her own docket included pending cases from 2013 that over the years had bounced from one judge to another. The most recent judicial terminations came after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that immediately allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including for hiring more immigration judges. "Pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment," according to the emails shared with NPR. He listened to cases until his last day but had been expecting the termination notice since the April round of firings — and had already cleared out his office in preparation.

Article: With midterms more than a year away, a record number of lawmakers are eyeing the exits toggle caption Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images Since President Trump returned to the White House this year, a record number of members are eyeing the exits as the Republican-led Congress has largely ceded its power to Trump's vision of the country. With just under 15 months to go until the 2026 midterms, nine Senators and 21 House members have announced they don't plan to run for reelection, each a modern record for this point before the election, according to an NPR analysis of Congressional campaign data since 2017. 12, 2025, there will be 470 Congressional seats on the ballot in 2026: all 435 House seats, 33 regularly-scheduled Senate contests and two special elections to fill the remainder of Senate terms in Ohio and Florida. Sponsor Message Digging into the data of Congressional retirements and relocations over the last decade since Trump first took office in 2017, this year's midterm cycle is notable, too, for the surge in members of Congress looking to leave Washington and serve as governor of their state. Jessica Taylor, the Senate and Governors editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said this cycle's inversion of the typical governor-to-Senate pipeline is the highest the country has seen in at least 90 years. "The Senate used to be the world's greatest deliberative body, but a lot of those people that worked across the aisle have retired or been defeated." It's also a move that carries a high degree of success. According to Ballotpedia's research, 10 of 14 incumbent or ex-senators have won their gubernatorial campaigns in the last 40 years, compared to 27 of 56 governors who ran for Senate. Sponsor Message This year, it's also notable to look at governors who have opted not to run for Senate in key races, like popular Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire. Some of these figures may have eyes towards the wide-open 2028 presidential primaries on both sides of the aisle as reasons to avoid running for Senate, Taylor adds, "but there's no doubt that just Washington is a less attractive place than it was a few decades ago." On the House side so far, there are nine Representatives, five Democrats and four Republicans, looking to make the jump to the Senate, also higher than some recent election cycles. Taylor said another reason some members of Congress might be choosing to run for governor is to raise their political profile in a way that holding that position might not have in the past. I think after COVID, more people are paying attention to governors." Departures keep growing in the Trump era toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Of the 535 lawmakers that were in the 115th Congress that coincided with the start of Trump's first term in 2017, just over half are no longer in office. Seventy-five members of Congress joined some time after 2017 and are no longer there, including several placeholder members who were appointed to hold vacant seats until the next election, lawmakers drawn out of their seats in the latest round of redistricting and more controversial figures like the expelled former Rep. There are lawmakers who resigned to join a new presidential administration, like former Oklahoma Republican Senator-turned-NASA-administrator Jim Bridenstine, who served in Trump's first term, former Senators-turned-vice presidents Kamala Harris and JD Vance and former Florida Sen. The most common form of departure for members of Congress in the Trump era by and large has been retirement, followed by losing in the general election, running for a different office or getting ousted in a primary. Taylor says there are two big reasons that lawmakers might want to leave Washington nowadays: having a life beyond Congress and because of the additional scrutiny on the age and performance of older lawmakers, exacerbated by questions about former President Biden's health during the 2024 election. So far this year, the president's push to exert power over Congress, its budgetary authority and other changes may entice Republicans who aren't fully on board to hang up their hat, Cook Political Report's Jessica Taylor said. "And I do think, there's a fight within the Republican Party that if you are more of a moderate, continually having to bump up against Trump and his allies is exhausting." Sponsor Message The August recess for the House and Senate is a time when lawmakers return home to their districts and get a taste of what their constituents – and polling data – says about the popularity of the current administration and how much of an uphill battle they could face in a re-election campaign.

Article: High prices and healthcare costs may turn Latino voters away from Republicans in 2026 toggle caption Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty Images Support for President Trump and his party is starting to wane among Latino voters. According to Equis Research, a Latino polling organization, about a third of Latinos who supported Trump last year "are not set on voting for a Republican" during next year's midterms. Caitlin Jury, a research director at Equis Research, told NPR that economic issues such as persistently high prices on groceries are driving many Latino voters, who were key in getting Trump elected in November, away from the party. "And if they want to retain any gains they may have made among Latino voters, they need to be sure to deliver on the promises they made that maybe gave them some additional support in the last election." Sponsor Message Daniel Garza, president of the Libre Initiative – a group that mobilized Latino voters on economic issues to support conservative candidates, said many Latinos are not satisfied with the current economy. "Folks aren't getting good paying jobs, wage growth, checks on inflation, affordable health care and housing and quality education." But, Garza said, it's only been six months and he is optimistic that most Latinos who voted for Republican candidates will be patient. "And I think there is a patience with this administration for their reforms … and the changes that they put into place to take effect." Melissa Morales, the founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, a left-leaning Latino voter mobilization organization, said her group's polling has found that pessimism about the economy among Latino voters since Trump took office is only growing at this point. "So we do expect to see some movement one way or the other." As of now, Latinos have a lot of dissatisfaction with how Republican lawmakers are handling their most important issue. economy today as poor (64%), including nearly a third who say it is very poor (32%)." A majority of voters (56%) also reported feeling that the economy was only getting worse under Trump. "We're going to be watching that." What this means for Democrats toggle caption Rebecca Noble/AFP via Getty Images This growing discontent with Republicans hasn't directly translated into support for Democrats, though. "What we're seeing here is certainly a rising cynicism towards both parties," Equis Research's Caitlin Jury said, "especially among some key swing voters." Jury said her group found an increase in people reporting that they were unsure what party they will support in next year's midterm elections – including among "Biden defectors," defined as voters who cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024 – as well as Trump voters writ large. Sponsor Message "So, these are folks who were telling us they were set on voting for a Republican when we talked to them earlier this year in May," she said. So, [there is] movement away from Republicans, but not quite yet towards Democrats." Jury said if Democrats want to win over some of these voters by next year, they "need to offer Latinos a proactive vision" for dealing with many of their concerns. He said a lot of Latinos don't like the direction of the party in the past few years, "The optics, the narratives, the actual policies that are being passed, all favor Republicans at this point," he argued. Morales said the disillusionment and dissatisfaction among Latino voters, including among many people who voted Trump, does actually give a significant opportunity for Democrats to change course and provide a "sweeping economic vision." It could provide an alternative to Trump's less popular economic policies like tariffs and tax cuts favoring billionaires.

"There is a fear this may be similar to what's happened to people rounded up due to their immigration status," Whitehead said, pointing to detention camps that have sprung up around the country. That could lead to a lot of very bad outcomes including death." More pressure, fewer services Experts also voiced concern about efforts to pressure people living with addiction into treatment at a time when there aren't enough recovery facilities capable of treating the complex health issues that stem from use of fentanyl, methamphetamines and other toxic street drugs. "They're people who happen to have an illness that can be devastating." In recent months, the Trump administration has slashed funding for addiction research and treatment grants, while also sharply reducing Medicaid insurance spending that many people with substance use disorder rely upon. "I wish they would stop treating homeless people like we're dogs and like we're all addicts." toggle caption Maansi Srivastava/NPR According to Leavitt, roughly 70 homeless camps in Washington have already been broken up since March by federal authorities.

It's terrible." By that time, parts of Kerr County had already been inundated with floodwaters for several hours, flood alerts had been issued, and the Kerrville Police Department had received calls for multiple water rescues. "And so many people here in RVs for the 4th." Flood waters left debris including vehicles and equipment scattered in Louise Hays Park on July 5, 2025, in Kerrville, Texas. Praise the lord." An individual identified as natural resources manager Shelby Taber responded, "Glad to hear camp mystic is all safe!" But by mid-afternoon, the UGRA's senior leadership appeared to realize the situation at Camp Mystic was more dire -- though they did not know specific details. We, however, need to be concerned that the county does not try to sieze [sic] control." Contacted by ABC News regarding the messages, officials with the UGRA did not respond to a request for comment. 'Vulnerable to flash floods' ABC News previously asked the UGRA for any flood after-action reports it may have created over the last 25 years following other storms along the Guadalupe River, but a law firm representing the authority said that they "have no responsive information." Documents released over the last month show that concerns over the risks posed by the Guadalupe River in Kerr County were widely known ahead of the Fourth of July floods, with the UGRA being particularly cognizant. As ABC News previously reported, the authority submitted an application last year to state officials seeking a $1 million grant from the Texas Flood Infrastructure Fund for a project called the "Kerr County Flood Warning System" that would have included "high water detection systems at 10 low water crossings." "Since 1932, approximately 35 lives have been lost in floods in Kerr County. However, in October 2024 the UGRA declined to continue applying for funding from the Infrastructure Fund, with Bushnoe writing in a letter at the time that although Kerr County was "vulnerable to flash foods," the project would have been "only eligible for a 5% grant." "We will continue to explore options to implement a Kerr County flood warning system and financial assistance opportunities," Bushnoe's letter said. The UGRA later reached an agreement with a company called Kisters to develop a different flood warning system that would have consisted of a "centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response." The agreement, which was signed exactly one month before the July 4 floods, indicated that the project was expected to cost more than $70,000. 'We'll be getting lots of calls' July 4 was supposed to be a day of celebration in Kerr County, with a major Independence Day fireworks event called "Fourth on the River" scheduled to take place just a stone's throw from the Guadalupe River. "Unfortunately it seems like it takes major loss of life to get the ball really rolling on it like Blanco 2015 did," an apparent reference to another flood a decade ago. "I have a feeling we'll be getting lots of calls from very angry people asking why we let this happen because they want someone to blame and I'm going to have no idea what to tell them," one official wrote at 7:21 a.m. "Some of the comments I'm seeing are saying things along the lines of 'how is there now [sic] flood warning system in 2025?'" an employee wrote to Linscomb early in the morning on July 5.

Article: National Guard, pressing federal agents into urban law enforcement and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department — all in the name of fighting violent crime in the nation's capital — Trump invited Bowser to cooperate with his administration. "What I’m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have," Bowser told reporters after a Tuesday meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi. That's not to say Bowser is thrilled with the position she finds herself in, effectively handing over law enforcement in her city to a president with whom she has had a complicated relationship since his first term. During a videoconference with Washington, D.C., community leaders Tuesday evening, Bowser described Trump's maneuvers as an "authoritarian push." But on the whole, her response has been far more measured than those of Democrats — both in the D.C. "The Trump administration has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. "We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate." In a Monday news conference announcing his assertion of power through an executive order, Trump called Bowser "a good person who has tried," adding that he acted because "she has been given many chances." As Bowser noted during a Monday news conference, the city and federal agencies have a long history of working together to plan, execute and protect special events in the city, including during both of Trump's terms. The two are also largely aligned on the goal of bringing the Washington Commanders back to the city from the Maryland suburbs, and Bowser attended a White House news conference on the topic in May. Park Police, were used to violently break up a peaceful demonstration outside Lafayette Square, just steps from the White House, clearing a path for Trump to walk to a nearby church to address the news media. In a letter to Trump in June 2020, before officers on horseback drove demonstrators away from the park, Bowser accused him of "inflaming" and "adding to the grievances" of protesters, creating a more dangerous dynamic. Bowser is at a disadvantage at a time when her administration is fighting to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in May that he would move "as quickly as possible" to fix what some Republicans said was a mistake in the drafting of the law. The Senate passed a change earlier this year, but the House, which is out of session for its August recess, has made no move toward sending it to the president for his signature. Beyond that, federal law plainly gives the president the power to assume control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for up to 30 days at a time when he declares an emergency, as he did this week, and to activate the D.C. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that roughly 850 federal law enforcement officers and agents fanned out across the city Monday night and made 23 arrests on charges ranging from homicide and drug crimes to skipping out on a fare and reckless driving. Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland and president of the Democratic Mayors Association, said in an interview with NBC News that municipal leaders across the country are watching what's happening in Washington — on the heels of Trump activating the California National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles — with wary eyes. "I want to be very crystal clear about something: We do not want the National Guard in our cities.” Bibb also defended Bowser's handling of Trump's crackdown this week, pointing to the unusual situation Bowser finds herself in compared to leaders of other major cities. “She understands and recognizes that she’s in a unique position where there’s no real statehood in D.C., and her autonomy can be limited, but at the end of the day, she’s going to continue to do the job she’s been doing on reducing violent crime, with or without the support of Donald Trump,” he said.

Article: Medicare enrollees who buy the optional Part D drug benefit may see substantial premium price hikes — potentially up to $50 a month — when they shop for next year’s coverage. Such drug plans are used by millions of people who enroll in what is called original Medicare, the classic federal government program that began in 1965 and added a drug benefit only in 2006. Policy experts say premiums are likely to go up for several reasons, including increased use of some higher-cost prescription drugs; a law that capped out-of-pocket spending for enrollees; and changes in a program aimed at stabilizing price increases that the Trump administration has continued but made less generous. Spending by insurers and government programs for prescription drugs in 2024 across the market grew more than 10%, which is slightly greater than in recent years, according to a research report published last month in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. The Trump administration, according to The Washington Post, is considering a five-year pilot program in which Medicare Part D plans could voluntarily expand access to the drugs, which can cost more than $1,000 a month without insurance. That $2,000 cap is a big change from previous years, when people taking expensive drugs had a higher threshold to meet annually and were on the hook to pay 5% of the drug’s cost even after meeting that amount. “The Inflation Reduction Act was necessary to make Part D proper health insurance, but there’s a cost to do so.” While the cap is a big help for affected consumers, the reduced amounts paid by some beneficiaries — coupled with the cost shift to insurers — could lead plans to spread their increased expenses across all policyholders through higher premiums. A growing number of health plans have also begun to require enrollees to pay a percentage of a drug’s cost, rather than a flat-dollar copay, which can lead to larger-than-expected costs at the pharmacy counter, Dusetzina said. While consumers not currently taking high-cost specialty drugs may not see a benefit in the $2,000 cap initially, they might one day, say policy experts, who note that drugmaker prices continue to rise and that enrollees could fall ill with a condition like cancer or multiple sclerosis for which they need a very high-priced drug. “It’s important to think not just in context of those groups who hit the cap every year, but also people are paying more in premiums to protect their future selves as well,” said Casey Schwarz, the senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group. But those Medicare Advantage plans are not expected to increase the drug portion of their premiums, partly because the private sector plans are paid more per member than what it costs taxpayers for the traditional program. That means Advantage plans have far more money to add benefits, such as vision and dental coverage, which traditional Medicare does not include, or to use them to cushion the impact of rising spending on drug costs, thus limiting premium increases. The growing difference between premiums — fueled by the extra rebates flowing to the private sector plans — “is increasingly tilting coverage toward Medicare Advantage and making traditional Medicare plus a stand-alone PDP [prescription drug plan] unaffordable for many enrollees,” said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Trump administration reduced funding meant to slow premium growth The final factor in the premium increase equation is a program set up to slow the rise of premiums in stand-alone Part D plans. It began under the Biden administration to offset premium increases tied to changes in the Inflation Reduction Act by temporarily injecting additional federal dollars to help insurers adjust to the new rules. The average monthly premium for a stand-alone Part D drug plan dropped 9%, from $43 last year to $39 this year, according to KFF, even when factoring in that some plans raised prices by up to $35 a month, the maximum increase allowed under the stabilization plan for this year. A government official told The Wall Street Journal that the administration felt that keeping the full funding would have mainly benefited the insurers and cost taxpayers an “enormous, excess amount.” The stabilization effort next year will send $10 a month per enrollee to Part D insurers to help keep premiums in check, down from $15 this year. “We did see some plans this year were taking premium increases of that $35 amount in 2025, and I fully expect we will see some plans with increases up to $50 a month” next year, she said.

Article: Vice President David Antosh, whose family has run the company for over six decades, describes making affordable American-made jeans as both his family’s heritage and a way to support his community. 1 goal here at Round House Jeans is to make affordable American-made jeans that the average American can buy,” explained Antosh, who prices his denim pants at just $70 a pair and says he pays his employees above-market wages. TODAY The company embodies a lot of President Donald Trump’s “America first” economic ethos, but it’s also an example of how hard it’ll be for the president to compel clothing manufacturers to move operations to the United States. Round House makes clothes in America with domestic cotton and paying above-market wages, but Antosh acknowledged it’s only possible because he also sells jeans sewn in Bangladesh at far higher margins. By contrast, his Bangladesh-sewn jeans, which are still made with 100% American cotton, sell for $40 a pair, nearly half the price of the U.S.-made version, but deliver far higher margins of 20%. According to a Conference Board survey released Monday, the appeal of “Made in USA” has faded since 2022, as many Americans now link it to higher costs amid higher price sensitivity. Among the top goals for Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with steep tariffs is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of short-term market and economic duress. become more expensive from tariffs, we can’t subsidize our American-made jeans as much and their price must go up, meaning fewer customers can afford Made-in-USA.” Clothing imports already faced tariffs of 12%-17% before Trump’s presidency, according to the United States Fashion Industry Association. In his 2025 Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, over 80% of apparel companies said they plan to diversify sourcing to offset tariffs, while just 17% expect to increase sourcing from the U.S. Aside from a handful of luxury brands, most U.S.-made apparel is limited to basic items like T-shirts, hoodies and socks, due to the fact that American factories “don’t have the skill set, machinery or materials to make anything beyond that,” Ng explained. Opened in 2019 during Trump’s first presidency, the luxury brand’s facility produces designer handbags but has a defect rate far higher than the industry norm, making it the company’s worst-performing facility, according to a report from Reuters.

Article: But in the last several weeks, the once-arcane subject of redistricting — underpinned by Texas Democrats’ extraordinary exodus from their state to block Republican plans to redraw maps — has transformed into the burning hot center of Democratic politics. This is breaking through … because of how ruthless people are seeing Republicans be, and they want to see their Democratic leaders fight just as hard,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic consultant who has worked on senatorial and presidential campaigns. “Any [Democratic] voter thinking about 2028 is mad right now, and they really want Democrats to stand up and fight back.” President Donald Trump elevated the issue to the national stage when he said he wanted Texas to carve up its congressional map to create up to five more Republican districts to protect the party's narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms. While both parties have gerrymandered their states’ congressional districts in the past, the move in Texas stands out because it seeks to rip up the state’s map mid-decade, rather than after the new census every 10 years. We could sit on the sidelines, talk about the way the world should be, or we can recognize the existential nature that is this moment.” In another escalation on the issue, Newsom declared Tuesday night that Trump had missed a deadline and so California would be “historic” and “end the Trump presidency,” he said in a social media post that mockingly emulated the kind of statement Trump would make. “If Trump and Texas Republicans won’t play by the rules, we will look at every option available to stop their extreme power grab, and nothing will be off the table.” Andrew O’Neill, the national advocacy director for the progressive grassroots group Indivisible, referred to some of the Democrats’ remarks and actions as “productive ambition.” “Democratic leadership amongst Democratic voters — it’s in the toilet right now. “So it’s all well and good that you put out a boring press release that says you believe in democracy and fair maps, but if you’re not actually taking the fight to Republicans and drawing that strategic conflict, in the attention economy we currently live with, nobody’s going to hear you.” Hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers in Illinois has given Pritzker a platform to play protector-in-chief, vowing to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants. “There’s no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that’s here visiting our state,” Pritzker said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” “So it’s a lot of grandstanding. For instance, a new Siena College poll found that Hochul's job approval and favorability ratings have ticked up since June as she has been front and center in the redistricting debate. “Every day, he says, ‘Man, you know, everybody’s coming up to me, telling me how proud they are of you and for the fact that they didn’t even know what redistricting was and now they know,’" Romero said.

Article: The administration’s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year’s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people. “Never before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration’s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world — softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration’s version of the report, which U.S. “The Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,” Bruce said. “Individual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.” Europe In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation “worsened during the year,” citing restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of “crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.” In Germany, the report found “limits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.” In France, the State Department found “some limitations on freedom of speech.” And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. Asked by reporters about the Trump administration’s review of visa applicants' social media accounts, Bruce said: “We consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.” Brazil The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called “broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.” “The government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to ‘undermine democracy,’ disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,” the report says. The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro’s court case, saying he “personally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formally twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. The first group of Afrikaners from South Africa to arrive for resettlement listen to remarks by Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Troy Edgar after they arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Va., on May 12. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images file The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, “a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” The Trump Administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land — in some cases without compensation — in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. “The government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the report said, “including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.” El Salvador The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses.” But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of “unlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.” The Trump administration’s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador. Israel, the West Bank and Gaza The Trump administration’s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration report’s did last year. Khames Alrefi / Anadolu via Getty Images In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. The State Department’s findings also concluded that the Israeli government “took several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year’s end.” The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including “arbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.” The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, “unlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.” Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that “there have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.” But it again added that “Israeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.” And it did point out that human rights groups “frequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.” The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government’s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005. The new report said that “Russia’s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.” It also described “credible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.” It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity.

Article: Instead, two years after he graduated with a computer science bachelor’s degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, he’s unemployed and living with his parents in the suburbs of Chicago. I’m trying my best, but I guess my best isn’t good enough.” Barcenas has found himself in a job market with fewer places for young men, according to economists and recent labor market data. Amid a wider slowdown in hiring, the unemployment rate for men ages 23 to 30 with bachelor’s degrees has jumped in recent months to 6% — compared with 3.5% for young women with the same level of education, according to data analyzed by NBC News. The shift in employment prospects for men compared with women is tied partly to the changing dynamics of the labor market, in which much of the job growth has been driven by hiring in the health care and social services industry — in which nearly 80% of workers are female, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Essentially 100% of the labor force growth over recent months, maybe even a couple of years, has been coming from the health care industry, and that industry is overwhelmingly female,” said Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that brings together Democratic and Republican policymakers. It’s very rocky, and I’m not sure if I will make it, if the foundation will be good enough in the future or if it’s going to topple over,” he said. The economy added just 73,000 jobs in July and fewer jobs than previously forecast in May and June, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Every guy I know that is without a job right now wants to work, but they just can’t get it,” said Eli McCullick, who has been looking for a job for more than a year after he graduated with a degree in sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder. “It’s demoralizing for guys who really want to get ahead and it’s just not happening.” McCullick, 23, said he hasn’t even been able to get an hourly job at a restaurant or doing cleaning work at a hotel in the Boulder area, where he’s living at a property his father owns. After more than a year of looking for work, McCullick decided to pivot to law school, which he hopes to start next year, and he was able to use his personal connections to get a paid internship at a law firm this fall. Trump increased his support among younger men in the 2024 election, winning the vote among men under 30 by 1 percentage point over Democrat Kamala Harris, according to exit polls. “I voted for him, but I’ll tell you what, it wasn’t because of immigration, it wasn’t because of foreign policy; it was because I bought the big lie about prosperity and economic growth,” McCullick said. So I feel disaffected, not only in the job market narrowly, but politically generally.” Results from an NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey, in April found 45% of young men approved of Trump’s job performance, while only 24% of young women did. "President Trump’s America First policies unleashed historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and this same policy mix — at an even bigger scale — is set to deliver again in President Trump’s second term," Desai said. The White House, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pointed to declines in unemployment since Trump took office for men of all ages without a college degree and for men ages 20 to 24 regardless of education. (NBC News' analysis looked at a different group: men ages 23 to 30 with a bachelor's degree and those with a high school degree.) For decades, men’s employment prospects have been deteriorating while women’s have been on the rise. Since the 1990s, a greater share of women than men have been earning bachelor’s degrees, with nearly half of women ages 25 to 34 holding bachelor’s degrees as of last year, compared with just over a third of men, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Young men are likelier to be financially dependent on their parents compared with young women, with 74% of women describing themselves as mostly financially independent, compared with 62% of young men, according to a separate Pew survey released last year. Most men who aren’t working or looking for work said in a survey that it was because of personal health issues — most likely the result of men’s having more physically demanding jobs — while women’s top reason was caring for children, according to Sprick, of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “It’s not a great time for young men to be not doing great in the labor market,” said Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, which researches and advocates for men’s well-being. “We’ve already had these long-term trends in higher education and earnings and geographical mobility that are already pretty troubling.” Sean Breen, who graduated this spring with a communications degree from California State University, Long Beach, said he and nearly all of his high school friends, both men and women, are back home living with their parents and unemployed. “We’re all, we are back in Marin County this summer, all unemployed, all trying to find a barista job, a part-time something, because we haven’t found anything.” After having applied to hundreds of jobs, he said, Breen now plans to go to graduate school in the fall at Trinity College in Ireland, where tuition is significantly lower and, he hopes, jobs will be more plentiful. “I don’t want a pity party, but it was so interesting to be in my position and look at all my other peers, as well, and be like, what happened?” Breen said. “It didn’t really matter what school or degree — it’s just the current job market.” The struggles vary by industry, and Reeves said he would like more programs to encourage men to go into health care and break down the gender stereotypes around certain career paths — similar to efforts to encourage women to go into construction.

Article: UK, France and Germany ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran if talks don't resume The foreign ministers of Germany, France and the UK have offered an extension for negotiations with Iran until the end of August Last month, Iran said it was prepared for further talks but only once sanctions already in place were lifted and its right to a civilian nuclear programme was agreed. The UK, France and Germany have told the UN they are ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if it fails to resume talks by the end of August. In a letter to the UN and its chief António Guterres, three foreign ministers - Jean-Noël Barrot from France, David Lammy from the UK and Johann Wadephul from Germany - said they would enforce severe sanctions on Iran unless it agrees to limit its nuclear programme. "We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, the E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism," the letter said. Sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme were previously lifted in 2015 after Iran signed a nuclear deal with the E3, the US, Russia and China, agreeing limits on its nuclear operations and to allow international inspectors entry to its nuclear sites. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 during President Donald Trump's first term, with the leader saying it did too little to stop Iran from creating a pathway to a nuclear bomb. In May, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it had more than 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - well above the level used for civilian purposes and close to weapons grade.

Article: Trump-Putin meet will be 'listening exercise,' White House says, as Kyiv 'mobilizes' allies In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin is pictured in Moscow on August 12, 2025. Leavitt told reporters that a face-to-face meeting will give Trump "the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed." "I think this is a listening exercise for the president," Leavitt said. And so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end." Though details of Friday's meeting are still being ironed out, Leavitt said it was "part of the plan" for Trump to meet one-on-one with Putin. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said of the call that "both sides confirmed their commitment to a successful event." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend the event. Our coordinated efforts and joint steps -- of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, all countries that want peace -- can definitely force Russia to make peace." After meeting with European leaders, Zelenskyy will have a virtual call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, two officials with knowledge of the arrangements told ABC News. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 49 drones and two North Korean-made ballistic missiles into the country overnight, of which 32 drones and both missiles were shot down or suppressed.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European leaders and top United States officials ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week. Both the German and Ukrainian governments confirmed the visit on Wednesday, which comes as Kyiv and its European allies push to ensure their voices are heard in discussions about ending the war. But he has unsettled European allies by suggesting Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory and by floating the idea of land swaps, without specifying what Moscow might surrender. Zelenskyy claimed he rejected an offer on Tuesday that Putin had proposed, where Ukraine would withdraw from the 30 percent of the Donetsk region it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal. Advertisement Kyiv and European officials fear that any US–Russia agreement reached without them could legitimise Moscow’s seizure of Ukrainian territory – including Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – four regions which are partly occupied by Russia. Fighting continues in eastern Ukraine Meanwhile, fighting continues along the front line, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reporting 165 clashes with Russian forces over the past day, with the heaviest fighting in the Pokrovsk, Novopavlivka and Lyman sectors. In the Kherson region, Russian forces used a drone to strike a civilian car on the Novoraisk–Kostyrka highway, killing a man and a woman, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin on Telegram. The AFP news agency has also reported that Ukraine is continuing to lose more ground, with evacuations in Bilozerske, while Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces had advanced in Nikanorivka, Shcherbynivka and near Petrivka in the Donetsk region. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff said its forces were engaged in “difficult” fighting near Pokrovsk in Donetsk, a key logistical hub for Kyiv’s forces, whose capture would deal a significant blow to its front-line defences and prospects at securing a favourable peace deal with Russia.

Article: Kostas Tsingas, head of the fire brigade officers’ association, told broadcaster ERT News on Wednesday that 82 new fires were recorded across the country the previous day, a number he called “exceptionally high”. Nearly 5,000 firefighters assisted by 33 aircraft were deployed since dawn to contain the flames stoked by winds and hot, dry conditions near Patras, on the tourist islands of Chios and Zakynthos and in at least three inland spots. Hundreds evacuated Elsewhere in Europe, heat alerts were issued in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and the Balkans on Tuesday, with temperatures expected to soar above 40C (104F) in some regions. Europe has been battling wildfires for weeks now, with smoke and greenhouse gas emissions related to forest fires since the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere among the highest ever recorded, according to the EU climate monitor Copernicus. The head of the regional government Alfonso Fernandez Manueco pledged “to act quickly and generously” once the fire is over to restore the site “to its full glory as soon as possible”. “I’m so sorry because there are lots of animals up … that will also get burned [if] no one … finds them,” Mari Carmen, a Spanish resident of Galicia, told Al Jazeera.

Article: European leaders are scrambling to convince United States President Donald Trump to use his upcoming summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to amplify pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Trump, who has promised to end the three-year war, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties are close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. On Wednesday, August 13, major European leaders are first convening among themselves and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and are then scheduled to speak to Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Here’s what Europe and Ukraine request of Trump, as he prepares for the meeting with Putin; Keep Ukraine in the room Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018. But he said he hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin, though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy. Let him not be on our side but in the middle.” On August 9, heads of state from France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Commission issued a statement in support of Ukraine. “We underline our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said, adding: “We continue to stand firmly alongside Ukraine.” The statement also insisted that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine”. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who is convening a video call on Wednesday involving Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy and several European leaders to discuss Ukraine, has since doubled down on that message. “We cannot accept that territorial issues between Russia and America are discussed or even decided over the heads of Europeans, over the heads of Ukrainians,” Merz said in a television interview on Sunday. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on August 10 that “the US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”, but “any deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the whole of Europe’s security.” Ceasefire first Last week, Putin presented the Trump administration with a ceasefire proposal, demanding major territorial concessions from Kyiv in eastern Ukraine in exchange for an end to the fighting, according to European officials. Elsewhere, Zelenskyy said in a video message posted to his social media account on Monday night that “he [Putin] is definitely not preparing for a ceasefire or an end to the war”. Trump went on to say that “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval.’ I mean, he’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap – because there’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump said. He added that the land swap will be “for the good of Ukraine,” before adding that a possible deal will also involve “some bad stuff for both” Kyiv and Moscow. “We’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” he said.

Article: Cholera is ripping through the camps of Tawila in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left with nothing but the water they can boil to serve as both disinfectant and medicine. “We mix lemon in the water when we have it and drink it as medicine,” said Mona Ibrahim, who has been living for two months in a hastily erected camp in Tawila. Nearly half a million people sought shelter in and around Tawila from the nearby besieged city of el-Fasher and the Zamzam displacement camp in April, following attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), at war with Sudan’s army since April 2023. The first cholera cases in Tawila were detected in early June in the village of Tabit, about 25km (16 miles) south, said Sylvain Penicaud, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF. In the past month, more than 1,500 cases have been treated in Tawila alone, he said, while the United Nations children’s agency says about 300 of the town’s children have contracted the disease since April. Ibrahim Adam Mohamed Abdallah, UNICEF’s executive director in Tawila, said his team “advises people to wash their hands with soap, clean the blankets and tarpaulins provided to them, and how to use clean water”. “It is extremely worrying,” said MSF’s Penicaud, but “those people have no (other) choice.” The UN has repeatedly warned of food shortages in Tawila, where aid has trickled in, but nowhere near enough to feed the hundreds of thousands who go hungry. MSF has opened a 160-bed cholera treatment centre in Tawila, with plans to expand to 200 beds, and a second centre in Daba Nyra, one of the most severely affected camps, but both are already overwhelmed, said Penicaud.

For the last several months, the registered nurse, alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, has volunteered her free time to help document masked federal immigration officials coming into and out of Terminal Island, which is being used as a staging area for immigration enforcement operations. The Department of Homeland Security blamed Trebach for inciting her own arrest, saying in a statement that she “jumped in front of moving vehicles, causing [Border Patrol agents] to swerve out of the way.” Advertisement Trebach allegedly “continued to hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents. However, Trebach was released from the federal detention center in Los Angeles on Saturday night without criminal charges, according to National Nurses United, a union and professional association of registered nurses.

Article: Here, she demonstrates in front of the Hammer Museum in Westwood on July 30, 2025, where Lynda and Stewart Resnick — owners of Wonderful — have gifted millions of dollars. One of California’s largest agricultural employers plans to close a Central Valley grape nursery by the end of the year after laying off hundreds of employees, including many supportive of a United Farm Workers effort to unionize the workforce. Wonderful Co., owned by billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick, plans to shut down the majority of the nursery in Wasco, northwest of Bakersfield, and donate the farm to UC Davis, representatives for the company and the university confirmed this week. The move comes as Wonderful Nurseries remains locked in a battle with the UFW after the union last year petitioned to represent workers growing grapevines, using a new state “card check” law that made it easier for organizers to sign up workers. Advertisement “The decision to wind down Wonderful Nurseries was purely a business decision and in no way, shape or form related to our ongoing litigation with the UFW or the fraud so many farm workers reported by the union,” Wonderful Co. The table and wine grape industry is in a major downturn, meaning nurseries such as theirs have seen “significantly decreased sales and record losses, with no expectation of a turnaround anytime soon.” Yet some labor experts and Wonderful employees are questioning the timing of the layoffs, which started just five months after the UFW won a key legal victory in its effort to organize the workforce. Or is it really that they’re making a sound financial decision?” The UFW has not directly accused the Resnicks of retaliating against workers supportive of the union by closing the farm. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) At its seasonal peak, the 1,400-acre nursery employs about 600 workers who would have been part of the bargaining unit, but now only 20 still work at the facility, said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for the union. “We look forward to working with the Wonderful Company to successfully transfer the Wasco facilities and property to the University later this year.” The Resnicks are big donors to state politicians and charities, but their philanthropy has been the target of recent union organizing efforts. In late July, UFW and other labor organizers gathered outside the Hammer Museum, the recipient of more than $30 million in donations from the Resnicks, who have a building named after them. In the video, the worker, who has been a forefront anti-union advocate and has organized protests, is seen handing out $100 bills from the trunk of a car and encouraging workers to sign a sheet. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) Advertisement Now that Wonderful is closing its Wasco grape nursery, it is unclear what will happen in the proceedings, because there will soon be no workers to unionize. The UFW has rejected those accusations and, with the video, is suggesting that workers were paid to protest against the unionization effort at the height of the back-and-forth a year ago. Silva, a Wonderful Nurseries worker for the last six years, said tensions have long been running high at the nursery, with some co-workers saying they don’t have a right to ask for raises or benefits. Stop spending money fighting the United Farm Workers.” “This is my message to the Resnicks: if you can give millions to this art museum, which a majority of your workers will never visit, why can’t you also pay your workers something fair?” she said at the protest. “If you care so much about being respected by artists and lovers of art, why can’t you respect the people who plant, grow and harvest the products you sell?” Advertisement The UFW filed its petition with the labor board in February last year, asserting that a majority of the 600-plus farmworkers at Wonderful Nurseries in Wasco had signed the authorization cards and asking that the UFW be certified as their union representative. A ruling by a Kern County Superior Court judge that found the certification process under the card-check law as “likely unconstitutional” was superseded in October by an appellate court, which is still reviewing the case. Ana Padilla, executive director of the UC Merced Community and Labor Center, said the Central Valley has been blanketed with anti-union messaging ever since the passage of the card-check law.

Advertisement “The Action Network has analyzed sky visibility, elevation, historical meteor activity, and astronomical infrastructure to compile a ranked list of the best states for witnessing celestial events,” the website announced. “The ranking of those places doesn’t necessarily make any sense at all and is probably based on a variety of assumptions, maybe some judgment involved about which of those states have more dark sky territory and accessibility,” said Ed Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory. Advertisement Experts also took issue with the ranking’s focus on the states with the highest chances of spotting an asteroid, since you can’t actually see an asteroid with the naked eye from anywhere. (Tayfun Coskun / Anadolu via Getty Images) An asteroid is a small rocky object that can be so dim and faint you would need a telescope and know how to operate it to locate the object, said Bob Stephens, an amateur astronomer with the Riverside Astronomical Society. Despite doubts about the website’s methodology for picking the best stargazing state, California experts do agree there are plenty of areas within the state that allow people to enjoy a variety of cosmic events. Advertisement There are five internationally recognized Dark Sky Places in California, all in the southern part of the state, according to Dark Sky International, an organization that works to combat light pollution.

Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley National Park have been designated Dark Sky Parks, possessing “exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights and a nocturnal environment,” according to the organization. Julian and Borrego Springs are considered Dark Sky Communities, which were designated as such after showing “exceptional dedication to the preservation of the night sky through the implementation and enforcement of a quality outdoor lighting ordinance, dark sky education and citizen support.” Getting the best view depends on what you want to see. If you’re interested in seeing galaxies and clusters, it does benefit you to go to Dark Sky areas; you don’t absolutely have to, but they’ll be more spectacular in those designated areas. “There’s inexpensive robotic telescopes that can be operated from anywhere that can show you a lot, but I hesitate to tell people to start there because you spend $500 and then you lose the interest and it sits in a closet,” Stephens said. “Every month our local club goes down to the local shopping center under the parking lot lights to show people the moon, planets and some of the brighter clusters,” Stephens said.

Article: President Trump’s decision to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington has California officials on high alert, with some worrying that he intends to activate federal forces in the Bay Area and Southern California, especially during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The Washington deployment is another example of Trump seeking to use the military for domestic endeavors, similar to his decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles in June, amid an immigration crackdown that sparked protests, experts said. Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said in a statement that the president’s characterization wasn’t rooted in fact, but “based in fear-mongering in an attempt to score cheap political points.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it “performative” and a “stunt.” Trump has said he would consider deploying the military to Los Angeles once again to protect the 2028 Olympic Games. Advertisement Los Angeles City Councilmember Imelda Padilla, who sits on the city panel overseeing the Games, acknowledged last week that the city is a “little nervous” about the federal government’s plans for securing the event. Padilla said her concern was based on the unpredictable nature of the administration, as well as recent immigration raids that have used masked, heavily armed agents to round up people at Home Depot parking lots and car washes. Bass, appearing on CNN this week, said that using the National Guard during the Olympics is “completely appropriate.” She said that the city expects a “federal response when we have over 200 countries here, meaning heads of state of over 200 countries. “To say, well, we can take over your city whenever we want, and I’m the commander in chief, and I can use the troops whenever we want.” On Monday, Trump tied his action to what has been a familiar theme to him: perceived urban decay. We’re not going to lose our cities over this.” Advertisement White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said officers and agents deployed across the District of Columbia have so far made 23 arrests for offenses including homicide, possession with intent to distribute narcotics, lewd acts, reckless driving, fare evasion and not having permits. They would be aghast that there are soldiers patrolling their streets.” The District of Columbia does not have control over its National Guard, which gives the president wide latitude to deploy those troops. “We have such a strong tradition that we don’t use the military for domestic law enforcement, and it’s a characteristic of authoritarian countries to see the military be used in that way,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley Law School and a constitutional law expert. “That’s never been so in the United States, and many are concerned about the way in which President Trump is acting the way authoritarian rulers do.” Advertisement Whether the troops deployed to Los Angeles in June amid the federal immigration raids were used for domestic law enforcement in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is central in the trial underway this week in federal court in San Francisco. There are circumstances where the federal government has put departments under consent decrees — a reform tool for agencies that have engaged in unlawful practices — but in those cases the government alleged specific civil rights violations, said Ed Obayashi, a Northern California sheriff’s deputy and legal counsel on policing.

Article: Los Angeles public schools are opening Thursday for the new academic year confronting an intense and historically unique moment: They will be operating in opposition to the federal government’s immigration raids and have set in motion aggressive moves to protect children and their immigrant parents. School police and officers from several municipal forces will patrol near some 100 schools, setting up “safe zones” in heavily Latino neighborhoods, with a special concentration at high schools where older Latino students are walking to campus. “Here you have an entire array of elected officials, appointed officials, education leaders, people committed to our children, and we are gathered here today to talk about protecting our children from the federal government,” Bass said. Instead agents were conducting “a targeted operation” on a “criminal illegal alien,” they described as “a Salvadoran national and suspected MS-13 pledge with prior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity of Arleta.” Advertisement At a Tuesday White House briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, responded to a question that referenced the L.A. This administration wants to ensure that all school children across the country, in every city, from Los Angeles to D.C., can go to school safely.” LAUSD will oppose “any entity, at any level, that seeks to interfere with the educational process of our children,” said Supt. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) School communities in fear The incident outside Arleta High is among the ongoing confrontations across the region that have provoked public protests and prompted the Trump administration in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles. Trump administration policy is that no location — including a school — is off limits for enforcement actions in his drive to deport at least 1 million immigrants a year. “A big part of it is to create the sense of fear so people will self-deport,” said Jimmy Gomez, a Trump critic and Democratic member of Congress representing Los Angeles. Advertisement “We’re about to welcome students back to schools, but we’re very concerned that these fears and anxieties may potentially have an impact for students not wanting to come back,” said Lynwood Unified school board member Alma Castro, an organizer of the event. She called her district a “safe haven.” Among other measures, her district has trained staff to “restrict the sharing of any student files, any student information, and there’s been some work with thinking about our facilities to ensure that we have campuses that are closed off, that people can’t just walk in.” L.A. “But we are deploying resources at a level never before seen in our district.” Other various efforts include: Starting a task force to coordinate safe passage zones with local cities Setting up a donor-supported compassion fund to help families with legal and other costs Coordinating food aid for families in hiding Providing legal referrals Contacting more than 10,000 families to encourage them to send children to schools Providing information about online schooling options Distributing a “family preparedness” guide Carvalho and leaders of other school districts reiterated that K-12 campuses and anything related to schooling, such as a school bus or a graduation ceremony, will be off limits to immigration agents unless they have a valid judicial warrant for a specific individual — which has been rare. We hope that through our communication efforts, our awareness efforts, information and the direct counseling with students and parents, that we’ll be able to provide stable attendance for kids in our community.” Reason to be afraid Mary, a Los Angeles mother of three without legal status, was terrified, but more or less knew what to do when immigration agents came to her door twice in May for a “wellness check” on her children: She did not let them in to her home. Mary, who requested that her full name not be used, has three children, one of whom attends an Alliance College-Ready charter school, a network of 26 privately operated public schools.

Article: Advertisement That website paints a grim picture of the city’s finances and proposes a solution: allowing “a limited number of people to rent their second homes to travelers.” Supporters say the plan could generate about $80 million in tax revenue annually, especially as tourists descend on Los Angeles for the 2026 World Cup, 2027 Super Bowl, and 2028 Olympics. Advertisement Fliers for the campaign, which urges the City Council to amend the short-term rental ordinance to include second homes, list as supporters a broad coalition of groups, from unions like Teamsters Local 911 to the business-aligned Central City Assn. Nick Gerber, an organizer for the hotel and restaurant workers union Unite Here Local 11, which opposes the campaign, said that when a canvasser knocked on his door, he asked who the campaign’s supporters were. “I looked at the back of the shirt with all the [organizations] listed and did not see any of these short-term rental companies, but right away, I thought this was clearly something they were behind,” Gerber said. “It doesn’t say Airbnb on it, but this is something that Airbnb has been pushing for years, and they’re using what I think is pretty deceptive tactics to try to get sympathy from the public,” Soto-Martínez said. approves new rules for Airbnb-type rentals after years of debate The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to impose new rules on renting out rooms and homes for short stays, regulating a phenomenon popularized by the rise of online platforms such as Airbnb. Airbnb confirmed that it is involved in Save Our Services but declined to say whether it has contributed any money to the campaign and did not respond to questions about its exact role. “It’s pretty simple: new tax revenue from tourists can give Los Angeles much-needed funding for city services and union jobs that are at risk,” said Justin Wesson, senior public policy manager for Airbnb. Wesson said that Airbnb has organized a “diverse coalition” for the campaign and will continue to “support practical short-term rental policies that balance the benefits of tourism with community needs.” The campaign does not appear to be registered with the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, according to the commission’s website, and Airbnb did not immediately respond to a question about whether the campaign has registered. Anyone who spends $5,000 or more to attempt to influence municipal legislation, and who is not a lobbyist, is required to register with the commission as a “major filer” and report their spending. The campaign website notes that the additional tax revenue would come in two streams: an estimated $38 million from the sales tax generated by tourists spending money at local businesses and another $41 million from the transient occupancy tax of 14% on short-term rentals. Critics of Save Our Services said that Airbnb hosts often evade the transient occupancy tax and that the city should step up its enforcement of the tax instead of opening up more homes for short-term rentals. Randy Renick, executive director of Better Neighbors LA, which focuses on regulating short-term rentals, said evading the tax is “the fundamental issue,” with some Airbnb hosts claiming their residences are outside city limits. Maria Hernandez, a spokesperson for Unite Here, which is part of the Better Neighbors LA coalition, said an increase in short-term rentals would exacerbate the city’s housing shortage by removing units from the long-term market. “The way for the city to address its budget crisis is to enforce existing laws, fining the landlords who illegally convert housing to hotels, and making sure the platforms actually pay the taxes they avoid.” The campaign has created some strange bedfellows. City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who often spars with Soto-Martínez, also opposes the campaign, saying she doesn’t want to create an incentive for people to buy up properties and turn them into short-term rentals. “Labor, community, housing, business, and civic organizations have come together to find immediate and practical solutions that would help generate nearly $80 million in new annual revenue to save jobs and services, protect Angelenos’ livelihoods, and stabilize the city’s finances,” said Eric Tate, executive secretary treasurer for Teamsters Joint Council 42, in a statement.

Article: The budget reconciliation bill President Donald Trump dramatically signed into law last month will painfully extract $1,200 a year from the poorest people and sprinkle the richest with an extra $13,600 a year they may not even feel. Of course, we knew even before Monday’s report from the Congressional Budget Office reminded us that Trump’s bill — with its cuts to the social safety net and cuts to top earners’ taxes — would redistribute wealth from the poorest to the richest. The CBO, which does nonpartisan analysis for Congress, released the above numbers Monday in response to a request from four Democratic lawmakers: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York; Rep. The CBO’s letter is a response to the Democrats’ “request for an analysis of the distributional effects” of the bill that Republicans are touting as not just good but “beautiful.” The report found that the average U.S. household “will see an increase in the resources available to them over the 2026–2034 period” but that “the changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households” and that “in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution.” Specifically, the CBO report finds, “Resources for households in the lowest decile (tenth) of the income distribution will decrease by about $1,200 per year (in 2025 dollars),” which “amounts to 3.1% of their income.” The report adds, “Those projected decreases are mainly attributable to reductions in in-kind transfers, such as Medicaid and SNAP.” The bill means much less money for food and health care for the poor and a little more money in the bank for the rich. The extra 2.7% in income those in the top tenth of income distribution are projected to get “are mainly attributable to reductions in the taxes households in that decile owe.” If the CBO’s language is too staid or technical for you, then here’s another way to make the point: The bill means much less money for food and health care for the poor and a little more money in the bank for the rich. Despite Trump’s vows that he wouldn’t cut Medicaid, and despite some Republican lawmakers’ vows that they wouldn’t support a bill that cut Medicaid, it was always clear that Republicans — even with all their budgetary sleight of hand — couldn’t give what they wanted to give to the rich without taking away money used to provide health coverage for poor people. But not only did Trump and his party cut Medicaid; the bill is projected to have the effect of cutting 2.4 million people off SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program. Rather than confess to lying about the impact the bill would have, the Republicans said they weren’t hurting the country’s most vulnerable people, just going after fraud, waste and abuse. Jason Smith, of Missouri, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, claimed on social media that “CBO has a troubled track record of getting its estimates incorrect and, like Democrats, is biased in favor of more federal spending and higher taxes.” “Don’t buy it,” Smith added. Reading the CBO report, I couldn’t help but think of the Bible story in which the prophet tells the king a parable about a wealthy landowner with plenty of cattle and sheep who needs to feed a guest — and does so by stealing the only sheep his neighbor owns.

Article: Zelenskyy to visit Berlin for meetings ahead of Trump-Putin summit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will join German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Wednesday for talks with European and U.S. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings for Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine's leaders heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow's war in Ukraine. A call between leaders of countries involved in the "coalition of the willing" - those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv - will take place last. When Zelenskyy last visited Berlin in late May, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations and consultations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith to end the war. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was "currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war," and urged Ukraine's partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and "force Russia to peace." "Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as "a feel-out meeting" where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with "Putin and Zelenskyy and me." The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine's NATO membership off the table - something that Putin has demanded - and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Trump has also routinely threatened and cajoled his NATO allies over defense spending, and has shown little mercy in trade talks by hiking tariffs on most EU imports to 15%, ostensibly for U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss "certain aspects" of preparations for the Friday meeting in which "both parties confirmed their striving for a successful summit," according to the foreign ministry.

Article: UK firms chase £38bn India contracts but challenges loom 13 hours ago Share Save Nikhil Inamdar • @Nik_inamdar BBC News, Mumbai Share Save Getty Images UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated on par with Indian suppliers A standout feature of the India-UK free trade agreement signed last month was the Narendra Modi government's decision to open India's vast government procurement market to UK suppliers. Some 40,000 high-value tenders worth £38bn from federal ministries will now be open to bidding for UK businesses in strategic sectors like transport, green energy and infrastructure - areas which have thus far been heavily protected from foreign competition. It is "far greater" than what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates and "sets a new benchmark", Ajay Srivastava of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank, told the BBC. Under the agreement, UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated almost on par with Indian suppliers and also have real-time access to information on forthcoming public tenders and procurement opportunities. Also, goods from the UK made with just 20% domestic input can now be supplied to the Indian government, allowing UK companies the flexibility to source up to 80% of the parts or raw material from other countries and still qualify for procurement preference in India. The minimum contract value at which these firms can bid for government projects has also been sharply reduced as a result of which "UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects - such as rural roads, solar equipment for schools, or IT systems for government offices - that were previously out of reach", said Mr Srivastava. Getty Images UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects such as rural roads But for British companies, realising this opportunity on the ground will be easier said than done, several experts told the BBC. While UK suppliers are eligible to participate as Class-II local suppliers, Indian companies will continue to get preferential treatment as Class-I suppliers, says Dr Arpita Mukherjee, a trade expert with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. Moreover, pricing plays a key role in winning contracts, and "UK companies tend to have higher prices" compared with Indian companies, which will be a major challenge for them, she adds. A more significant deterrent will be delayed payments and difficult contract enforcement, which are "major legacy issues when it comes to public procurement in India", says Srijan Shukla of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank. He says a study on procurement by India's central public sector enterprises from 2017 to 2020 found that pending payments to suppliers were often more than the total average procurement in a year. "This will impact UK players trying to enter India's public procurement markets, especially when it comes to public contracts that have long-time horizons and are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties," Mr Shukla told the BBC. Pending dues have been a major irritant for India's small businesses too, leading to short-term liquidity issues that often "force them out of these procurement markets and reallocate that business to the big players", according to Mr Shukla. Much of this is reflected in India's poor ranking - 163 out of 190 - on contract enforcement in the World Bank's Doing Business report, the latest round of which was in 2020. While things have improved since these rankings were published - with one-stop-shop portals like Government e-Marketplace, the Central Public Procurement Portal or the recently launched online dispute resolution portal bringing more transparency to the public tendering process - payment discipline by government entities continues to remain a challenge, says Mr Shukla. She adds the deal excludes the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement's dispute settlement provisions for four years after the CETA takes effect - these provisions usually define how disputes are resolved. Over time, companies from the UK will have to learn the way to work around complexities regarding the art of winning public tenders and navigating though complex regulations," Mr Shukla says.

Article: U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of “systematic torture” at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents. Roslan Rahman / AFP via Getty Images file Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of “a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities” across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups. That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. “We’ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,” he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report. Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found. Myanmar’s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country.

Article: Miami’s Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for Cubans fleeing communist rule at the height of the Cold War MIAMI -- For decades, its powerful lighthouse illuminated Miami’s Biscayne Bay, and during the height of the Cold War, what was known as the Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing communist rule. What we’re doing here is reminding people what immigrants can accomplish when they’re given the opportunity.” The iconic building opened in 1925 as the headquarters of the once-acclaimed Miami Daily News, which shuttered decades ago. It was designed, in the style of a Moorish bell tower from Seville, Spain, by the New York architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, which was behind some of the most glamorous hotels, theaters and office towers of the era. Known to the Spanish-speaking migrants as “El Refugio,” or “The Refuge,” it was a safe place to get vaccines, fill out paperwork, and receive financial assistance of around $120 per month. In the Grand Hall, with its giant windows and Corinthian columns, the Pizarra de la Suerte — the Bulletin Board of Good Luck — carried job notices to help the Cubans adjust to their new life, according to a replica of the hall in the museum. But over time, the exiles would trudge back from the cold and snow to put their unmistakable Cuban stamp on what over the ensuing decades would become one of America’s most vibrant cultural and economic hubs. But he still wells up recalling the hardship of his departure — when Cuban customs officials ripped open his teddy bear looking for contraband jewelry — and arriving in Miami on a “Freedom Flight” paid for by the U.S. “To this day, a grilled cheese sandwich with cheap, Velveeta processed cheese is still comfort food to me.” The Freedom Tower, a national historic landmark, was long ago overtaken by Miami’s fast-growing steel and glass skyline. They include exhibits dedicated to Victims of Communism, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that the CIA organized against Castro, and the 14,000 unaccompanied minors sent by their parents as part of the U.S.-led Operation Peter Pan. There’s also a makeshift recording studio for those who passed through the Freedom Tower to add their testimony to an archive of over 300 oral history interviews with exiles, including prominent voices like singer Gloria Estefan. Emerging from the dark galleries of often traumatic stories of dislocation and exile, the museum’s final stop is a gallery flooded with all the sun, salsa and pastel hues that make modern-day Miami so beloved.

(Philippine Coast Guard via AP) MANILA, Philippines -- The United States deployed two warships on Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal, where two Chinese navy and coast guard ships collided two days ago while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident captured on video, alarming several Western and Asian countries. The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. Navy has staged what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea for years to challenge China’s restrictions and demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years. On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern “by the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard,” saying in a statement the incident "highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” “This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coast guard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the (anti-)collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.” Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500 feet (152 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coast guard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board.

(AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu) DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladeshi anti-corruption officials testified in court on Wednesday against former British Minister Tulip Siddiq, accused of using her familial connection to deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to obtain state-owned land plots in the South Asian country. Siddiq, who is Hasina's niece, resigned from her post as an anti-corruption minister in Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s government in January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt and was named in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh. Separately, the anti-corruption investigation has also alleged that Siddiq’s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled. Siddiq represents the north London district of Hampstead and Highgate in Parliament, served in Britain’s center-left Labor Party government as economic secretary to the Treasury — the minister responsible for tackling financial corruption.

Article: Breaking with the reality TV show that helped make Trump a household name, the Republican president is not telling his top appointees “You're fired!” but instead offering them another way to stay in his administration. Still, those leaving often are the subject of effusive praise and kept in Trump's political orbit, potentially preventing them from becoming critics who can criticize him on TV — something that didn't happen to a long list of former first-term officials. “It is a tremendous honor to represent the United States as an ambassador — which is why these positions are highly coveted and reserved for the president’s most loyal supporters," said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. "Mike Waltz, Billy Long and Tammy Bruce are great patriots who believe strongly in the America First agenda, and the President trusts them fully to advance his foreign policy goals.” Waltz's days appeared numbered after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg revealed in March that Waltz had added him to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. “From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first,” Trump posted in announcing Waltz’s move on May 1. But Bruce had also begun to frequently decline to respond to queries on the effectiveness, substantiveness or consistency of the administration’s approaches to the Middle East, Russia’s war in Ukraine and other global hotspots. She told reporters that special envoy Steve Witkoff “is heading to the region now — to the Gaza area” but then had to concede that she’d not been told exactly where in the Middle East he was going. During her final State Department briefing on Tuesday, Bruce said Trump's announcing that he wanted her in a new role “was a surprise,” but called the decision “especially moving as it allows me to continue serving the State Department, to which I'm now quite attached.” Then there’s Long, a former Republican Missouri congressman, who was the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862. After learning that Trump wanted him in Reykjavik, Long posted, “Exciting times ahead!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say Tuesday why Long was removed as IRS chief and being deployed to Iceland. Former television commentator Morgan Ortagus, who was a State Department spokesperson during Trump's first term, is now a special adviser to the United Nations after serving as deputy envoy to the Middle East under Witkoff. He posted in January, while announcing her as Witkoff's deputy, that “Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson." “These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them," Trump added.

Article: The mobilization officially marks the beginning of their deployment, and all 800 soldiers ordered by Trump to the city should be operational by the end of the week, a senior Army official said. Mayor Muriel Bowser struck a critical tone about Trump in remarks to community leaders last night, characterizing his actions as an “authoritarian push.” But on the whole, her response to the mobilization has been far more measured than those of Democrats, both in the D.C. She also struck a neutral tone after a meeting yesterday with Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she was focused on “how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.” Bowser’s reaction to Trump might have something to do with the law, federal money and a long-standing threat to repeal self-government in the city being lined up behind him, giving the mayor little choice but to comply. And she’s at a disadvantage as her administration fights to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. takeover: Black civil rights leaders and mayors of several cities said Trump’s move is “fundamentally grandstanding.” And by suggesting that other cities run by Black mayors may be next, Trump was “playing the worst game of racially divisive politics,” one mayor said. The ongoing standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Texas, as the GOP moves to redraw district maps mid-decade (rather after the new census in 2030) and Democrats seek to stop them, has put the issue in the burning hot center of Democratic politics. JB Pritzker — whose state is hosting many Democratic lawmakers who left the Texas to deny a quorum in the state House — is taking on the role of protector-in-chief and has vowed to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants. Any Democrats hoping to draw attention on the national stage must show the base they know how to take off the gloves, says one leader at a progressive grassroots group. The White House is reviewing the Smithsonian’s museum exhibitions, materials and operations — and plans to commemorate the country’s 250th anniversary — to ensure it aligns with Trump’s views of history.

Article: Spirit Airlines sounds the alarm on its future ability to stay in business Just five months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business. Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year - which is accounting-speak for running out of money. AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year - among other challenges and "uncertainties in its business operations" that the Florida company expects to continue "for at least the remainder of 2025." Spirit's shares tumbled more than 40% Tuesday, with the company's stock closing at $2.10. And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines - many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings - Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process, and Spirit has not publicly indicated interest in such a transaction since.

Article: And the rate was the highest since 2003, which had a rate of 44 per 100,000, according to an analysis by Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans. Records dating back to the 1960s show that Washington’s homicide rate peaked in the 1990s at more than 80 per 100,000 people in 1991, or about double the rate in 2023. Trump held up a chart that first appeared on Fox News and was shared by Vice President JD Vance last week purportedly comparing Washington’s homicide rate to that of eight other “capitals.” (One, Lagos, Nigeria, is not a capital.) But the chart cites outdated data and omits several capitals and many other cities with much higher rates. Trump has a point that Washington’s homicide rate is much higher than many capitals, but its rate is nowhere near the highest “anywhere in the world.” In 2023, according to data compiled by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, capitals with higher homicide rates included Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with a rate of 67.2 per 100,000 people; Cape Town, South Africa, with 66.8; Kingston, Jamaica, with 64.2; Caracas, Venezuela, with 47.9; and Guatemala City at 47.8. Overall, the think tank reported, 47 cities with more than 250,000 people had higher homicide rates than 40.4 and 49 cities had rates higher than 39.1, including six in the United States: Memphis, New Orleans, St. According to data compiled by the city’s Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the police made about 1,500 arrests of children in 2020; 1,400 in 2021; 1,700 in 2022; 2,200 in 2023; and 2,000 in 2024. What Was Said “They know, these young gangs — or as they’re called here, crews — they know that if they’re 14, 15, 16, or 17, they’re below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree. And understand I’m not just a federal prosecutor, I’m the local D.A., so to speak here for D.C.: All of the cases go to family court and the goal of family court — the 14- through 17-year-olds — and those cases go to family court where the focus is rehabilitation and they talk about ice cream socials and yoga.” — Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. But youths arrested on other offenses can be prosecuted by the city’s elected attorney general, who prosecuted 84 percent of violent crimes committed by children in 2024, and about 73 percent of all crimes.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File) WASHINGTON -- Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border. It’s the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores — under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.” The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration’s threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando Gómez Martinez, also known as “La Tuta,” a former school teacher who became one of Mexico’s most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel. Alongside his two brothers, Abigael González Valencia led “Los Cuinis,” which financed the the founding and growth of the CJNG, one of the most powerful and dangerous cartels in Mexico.

Article: Speaking at a news conference in Ankara with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani, Fidan accused Israel and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, of undermining the country’s efforts to reestablish itself after more than a decade of civil war. He said Israel had “fueled certain difficulties” in Syria and warned that Israeli security "cannot be achieved through undermining the security of your neighbors." “To the contrary, you should make sure your neighboring countries are prosperous and secure. If you try to destabilize these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.” Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new interim government in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war. Most recently, hundreds were killed in clashes in the southern province of Sweida between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side and fighters from the country’s Druze minority on the other. Implementation of an agreement reached in March to merge the SDF with the new Syrian army has stalled and there have been scattered outbreaks of violence between the two sides. Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an “opportunity for themselves.” Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, affiliated with the Kurdish group that recently entered a peace process with Turkey after more than 40 years of fighting. “The upper echelons of the YPG need to stop stalling because the chaos they’re waiting for (in Syria) will not take place, and even if it does, it will not be to their advantage,” Fidan said. We have good intentions, but that doesn’t mean we will turn a blind eye to your mischievous or devious ways.” Turkey has been supportive of Syria’s new administration, which is formed largely by rebels that Ankara backed during the civil war. “There are certain people who have been meddling in the affairs of Syria, chief among whom is the Israeli administration.” Al-Shibani, meanwhile, said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts.”

(AP Photo/ Jennifer McDermott) Hanna Eberhard, with the World Wildlife Fund, arranges plastic waste on a conveyor belt display in front of the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, Aug. The messaging on the cardboard box from the Geneva-based Gallifrey foundation reads "no dirty tricks, vote for a clean plastics treaty.” As Thai diplomat Jutha Saovabha walked to the treaty talks Wednesday morning, Gallifrey Foundation spokesperson Laurianne Trimoulla stopped him to chat and handed him a soap. The meeting at the United Nations office in Geneva is supposed to be the last and people are getting creative to put the pressure on to get a deal done. The International Pollutants Elimination Network gave wristbands to UN officials, delegates and plastic waste workers before the talks to measure their exposure to chemicals used to make plastics and show the importance of protecting human health with the treaty. “What I was surprised by, is that all over the world, because this study has been carried throughout different regions, we are all being exposed to those added chemicals in plastics. There was a large red button that said “EMERGENCY”, plus a sign that read “PUSH THE BUTTON, STOP THE PLASTIC FLOOD NOW.” The WWF urged delegates to the talks to push the red button and halt the belt, to represent stopping plastic pollution. “We need to make sure all eyes are on Geneva in this critical moment where we have this once in a generation opportunity to create a safe and healthy world for everyone," said Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation in Geneva. Much like in Washington, D.C., industry leaders and company executives are meeting with delegates to answer questions and convey their priorities for the treaty, said Chris Jahn, president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council. “We’re happy to provide information when it’s useful and we’ll be here as long as we need to, to hopefully get a deal.” Benjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, is heaping piles of plastic waste onto a large sculpture in front of the U.N.

Article: After years of being told that red wine was good for heart health, more Americans appear to be heeding warnings that even moderate alcohol consumption can be unhealthy WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday. The federal government’s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans’ lives may be a reason why they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful. in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.” The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question’s history. About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.

Article: Even though the conflict did not involve Nakhchivan, it cut off the Zangezur Corridor, a 40km (25-mile) logistical umbilical cord to Azeri mainland that consists of a derelict road and parallel rusty rail tracks. Air travel and hours-long, bumpy transit through Iran remained the only way to reach the exclave, whose authorities ruled it like a personal fiefdom, with laws and ways of life often contradicting those of the mainland. After winning the 2020 war over Nagorno-Karabakh and restoring control over it three years later, Baku has been eager to revive the corridor, demanding its exterritoriality and even pondering the use of military force. It may increase the flow of Central Asian hydrocarbons to Turkiye and further to Europe, boost the regional economy – and upend Russia’s two centuries of domination in the region that also includes Georgia. But Trump cut through the Gordian knot on Friday, and his role “essentially, cements a new reality in the region”, according to Emil Mustafayev, the Baku-based chief editor of the Minval Politika online magazine. They also flattered Trump by naming the corridor the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP) and leasing it to Washington for up to 99 years with exclusive development rights. China, which has been promoting its Belt and Road Initiative in Asia and Eastern Europe, may remain “neutral” to it, and Russia, which has two military bases in Armenia, may “ignore it, at least, publicly”, he said. “But for Iran, it’s a real blow.” ‘A boost of Washington’s clout’ To guard the TRIPP, Washington may use a private military company – and eventually build a military base that nominally safeguards Armenia but actually keeps an eye on Iran, said Ukrainian political analyst Aleksey Kushch. “It means more potential pressure on Iran and a boost of Washington’s clout in the resource-rich Caspian region where US oil companies made sizeable investments” in the 1990s, he said. “No matter how paradoxical it sounds, it’s Moscow that has been and still is a decisive factor in the peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan and in solving the latter’s problem of accessing Nakhchivan,” said Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London. Advertisement “One of the main motives for rapprochement of both sides is their push to get rid of Moscow’s influence, of the peacekeeper’s role it has imposed on them,” he told Al Jazeera. A deal not yet done Baku, whose annual $5bn defence spending exceeds Yerevan’s entire debt-hobbled state budget, affirmed Armenia’s territorial integrity but did not withdraw from some 200sq km (77sq miles) of its land.

Article: Ahead of the summit, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war." BERLIN, Germany — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is joining German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Wednesday for talks with European and U.S. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings for Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine’s leaders heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow's war in Ukraine. A call between leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — will take place last. When Zelenskyy last visited Berlin in late May, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,” and urged Ukraine's partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and "force Russia to peace.” "Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as "a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region which is part of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine's ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts. Ukrainian drones struck the Unecha station which supplies the Russian army, the statement said, adding that damage and a large fire was reported in the area around the pumping station.

Article: Gaza talks to focus on releasing hostages all in one go, Netanyahu hints 10 minutes ago Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Share Save ABIR SULTAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Netanyahu has dismissed international criticism of his plans to expand the war Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that Gaza ceasefire efforts are now focused on a comprehensive deal to release all the remaining hostages at once. After indirect talks between Israel and Hamas broke down last month, Israel announced a controversial plan to widen its military offensive and conquer all the Gaza Strip - including the areas where most of its two million Palestinian residents have sought refuge. "The release of all the hostages, both alive and dead - that's the stage we're at." Palestinian armed groups still hold 50 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that triggered the war. Last week, unnamed Arab officials were quoted as saying that regional mediators, Egypt and Qatar, were preparing a new framework for a deal that would involve releasing all remaining hostages at the same time in return for an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. This is likely to be why, at a news conference on Tuesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told journalists that Cairo was still "making great efforts" with Qatar and the US - the other mediators - to revive the earlier phased plan. "The main goal is to return to the original proposal - a 60-day ceasefire - along with the release of some hostages and some Palestinian prisoners, and the flow of humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza without obstacles or conditions," Abdelatty said.

She is being tried in the land grab case together with her mother, Sheikh Rehana, brother, Radwan Mujib, and sister, Azmina.The four were indicted earlier and asked to appear in court; however, the prosecution said they absconded and would be tried in absentia. Separately, the anticorruption investigation has alleged that Siddiq’s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled. Advertisement Siddiq represents the north London district of Hampstead and Highgate in Parliament, and served in the UK’s centre-left Labour Party government as economic secretary to the Treasury – the minister responsible for tackling financial corruption.

Article: The Israeli military’s top commander, who officials say has cast doubt on government plans to capture Gaza City, was facing increasing pressure on Wednesday, with one minister criticizing him over the promotion of top officers and another suggesting he could be sacked. Eyal Zamir, the military’s chief of staff, pushed back last week against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to control Gaza City, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. General Zamir was concerned about the exhaustion and fitness of reservists, about risking the lives of Israeli hostages and about potentially tasking troops with governing millions of Palestinians, the officials said. Since then, tensions have intensified between General Zamir and the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, over the promotion of senior military officers, leading to a standoff between the two security leaders.

Article: Amber heat health alert remains in place with 33C forecast 45 minutes ago Share Save Simon King Lead Weather Presenter Malu Cursino BBC News Share Save PA Media An amber heat health alert remains place for parts of the UK until 1800 on Wednesday, as areas in England and Wales officially entered their fourth heatwave this summer. Temperatures will rise into the high 20Cs and low 30Cs, with parts of the East Midlands, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire experiencing the hottest weather with a maximum temperature of 33C forecast on Wednesday afternoon. There are further heavy and thundery showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland on Thursday, with an additional yellow weather warning in place from midnight on Wednesday until 22:00 on Thursday. While Scotland and Northern Ireland will not technically be in a heatwave, due to the three consecutive day rule, temperatures there are still well above the average for the time of year with a forecast of 25C to 29C on Wednesday. An amber heat health alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Met Office, means the weather's impacts are likely to be felt across the health service. Extreme weather events in Europe should be treated as "a health emergency, not just a climate one", a World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group that looks into the health impacts of climate change said on Wednesday. Citing a 2023 report, the Pan-European Commission on Climate and Health said that heat-related mortality in Europe has increased by 30% in the past two decades, with more than 100,000 deaths recorded. Trade union Unite has called for the introduction of a maximum working temperature to be set at 30C and for work to be stopped where temperatures cannot be controlled indoors or when no protection - such as shaded areas - can be provided outdoors. Highest temperatures of 2025: England - 35.8C Faversham, 1July - 35.8C Faversham, 1July Wales - 33.1C Cardiff Bute Park, 12 July - 33.1C Cardiff Bute Park, 12 July Scotland - 32.2C Aviemore, 12 July - 32.2C Aviemore, 12 July Northern Ireland - 30C Magilligan, 12 July The heat will ease for most on Thursday with some thunderstorms and some cooler, less humid air into Friday - but temperatures could rise again into the weekend.

Article: The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when his term expires in May, including three that have not previously been publicly named, according to two administration officials who declined to be named. They now join a list of 8 other candidates that CNBC has confirmed are under consideration, including Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, Fed Governor Chris Waller, and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. The officials described a "deliberative process" where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will interview all of the candidates, winnow down the list and pass on a final list to the president for his decision. The longer the process takes, the less likely there is to be a so-called "shadow fed chair" in place for several months before Powell leaves, which some have suggested would be disruptive for monetary policy. Though sharply critical — on an almost daily basis — of Powell, President Trump has backed off suggestions he might replace the Fed Chair before the end of his term in May.

(AP Photo/Ronald Zak, File) FILE - Ian's Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, waits for the start of the IAEA board of governors meeting at the International Center in Vienna, Austria, Nov. (AP Photo/Ronald Zak, File) BERLIN -- The top diplomats of Britain, France, and Germany threatened to reimpose sanctions on Iran as an end-of-the-month deadline nears for the country to resume negotiations with the West over its nuclear program and cooperation with the United Nations nuclear watchdog. The three countries, known as the E3, wrote in a letter to the United Nations dated Friday that they were willing to trigger a process known as the “snapback” mechanism, which allows one of the Western parties to reimpose U.N. “We have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism.” The letter comes following a period of apparent diplomatic deadlock after a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, where Israeli and American jets struck some key nuclear-related facilities in the Islamic Republic. The countries met with Iranian officials last month in Turkey at Iran’s consulate building in Istanbul on the possibility of reimposing international sanctions, lifted in 2015 in exchange for Tehran accepting restrictions and monitoring of its nuclear program. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, said at the time that he hoped that the meeting would see the E3 nations reassess their “previous unconstructive attitude.” Since the war, talks with Washington for a new nuclear deal have not resumed, and Iran has since suspended ties with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, following the attacks. One of the three countries opting to trigger the snapback mechanism would renew sanctions on Iran, but Tehran renewing cooperation with the IAEA and addressing concerns about its highly-enriched uranium stockpile would delay it, according to a diplomat who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity following July’s meeting in Istanbul. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. German Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher on Wednesday said the letter “once again underlines that the legal preconditions for snapback have long existed.” “Our position and our appeal is, very clearly, that Iran still has the choice of deciding to return to diplomacy … and full cooperation with the IAEA,” he told reporters at a regular news conference in Berlin. intelligence agencies and the IAEA had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Article: ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) has held above the key $4,000 level this week That shift was catalyzed by regulatory tailwinds that prompted a boom in institutional interest around stablecoins, which account for 40% of all blockchain fees and more than half of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain. In the last two and a half months, ETH treasury companies and ETFs have purchased 3.8% of all ETH in circulation, Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, pointed out in a note Wednesday. GENIUS Act, which clears the way for mainstream adoption of stablecoins, is a pivotal change" and "should also indirectly boost activity on Ethereum's layer 1 as increased stablecoin liquidity leads to more decentralized finance activity, where ETH dominates," Kendrick said. ETH gains also come after stablecoin issuer Circle's first earnings report , which showed a 53% jump in quarterly revenue on strong stablecoin growth, and ahead of the public trading debut of the crypto exchange Bullish, which has a focus on decentralized finance. Although ether has revisited this resistance mark a handful of times since 2021, it has been a challenging one psychologically and technically for traders and has not sustained it before now. When traders use leverage to short ETH and the coin's price rises, they buy ETH back from the market to close their positions, pushing the price up and causing more positions to be liquidated.

Article: Last week, actor Dean Cain, known for portraying Superman in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, announced that he was going to be sworn in as a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. He also posted an ICE recruitment video on Instagram with the Superman theme song playing in the background, and promoted the generous pay and benefits that come with being an ICE agent. But setting aside the irony that the Man of Steel himself was in fact also an undocumented alien, why would Superman be so keen to join ICE’s draconian raids targeting immigrants? The visuals of masked federal agents, hopping out of armoured vehicles, in military-style gear and swiftly descending on what ICE enthusiasts would claim are terrorists, rapists, paedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers and gang members, are deeply comforting for many in the US. This means that the development of the US criminal justice system has its roots not only in slavery, but also in the belief that slave revolts or any effort to upend the racial hierarchy in American society are an existential threat to the established social order. Whether it was the rise of organised crime during the Prohibition era of the 1920s, uprisings during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, or when President Richard Nixon declared drug addiction “public enemy no 1” requiring an “all-out offensive”, these have served as the pretext for strong, military-style policing on American streets. This militarisation of the police has been supported by Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, allowing local law enforcement agencies to access excess military equipment from the Department of Defense (DOD). The hard-edged, violent and brash cop, willing to stray outside the bounds of the law to protect innocent civilians from evil (the Muslim terrorist, the Soviets, the Germans) is a popular Hollywood and American TV show staple. This has normalised the perception that to keep America safe from such existential threats, it is sometimes necessary to use deadly force or extrajudicial actions, no matter how cruel or excessive they may seem. As an 18-year-old college student in upstate New York in the early 2000s, I was the physical epitome of all things evil and anti-American as the country waged its “Global War on Terror”. At the time, I remember a fellow student justifying the extra security checks I had to suffer through at airports, saying, “You cannot ignore the fact that you look like the people who hate us.” In my late 20s as a PhD student in Copenhagen, I had to hear a senior colleague say, “You’re Indian. Globally, we have also seen a proliferation of reality TV shows like Border Security: Australia’s Front Line and Nothing to Declare UK that claim to show the reality of the multiple threats that Western countries encounter at their borders. That said, in the same year, he also signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, allowing undocumented migrants who were brought into the country as minors to apply for “renewable two-year periods of deferred action from deportation, allowing them to remain in the country”. That said, during Trump’s tenure in the White House, the anti-immigrant rhetoric has been vicious, and the Republican leader does not shy away from portraying migrants as synonymous with criminality and an existential threat to the demographic, moral and cultural fabric of the United States. This framing of immigrants as a problematic presence in American society served as a pretext for Trump’s plan to build a wall across the US-Mexico border to stop the movement of undocumented migrants, the travel ban on citizens from several Muslim countries, and a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Program. With the genocide ongoing in Gaza and the concurrent visibility of the Palestine solidarity movement, the anti-immigration movement has merged with anti-Palestinian racism, with ICE also targeting pro-Palestine activists whom the Trump administration claims hold views that are antithetical to American values. With all of this in the background, it then makes sense that an actor who once played an undocumented alien on TV and who himself has Japanese heritage would join ICE.

Article: Abuja and Nasarawa, Nigeria – In the neighbourhood of Kado Lifecamp on the outskirts of Nigeria’s capital, 29-year-old Eucharia Joseph grips a cooler box and sets out for her day. With ongoing insecurity in northern Nigeria and pockets of resistance elsewhere, the job of eradicating polio now rests heavily on the shoulders of women like Joseph, who are often the only ones granted access to households due to a confluence of cultural, religious and safety reasons. Such rumours about the effects of vaccines have circulated for years, often fanned by misinformation circulating among community networks, some religious leaders, and occasionally by armed groups such as Boko Haram, which has attacked vaccinators and portrayed immunisation as part of a foreign agenda. “That’s the best approach for the government to use for creating more awareness about [the need and effectiveness of] polio vaccines.” In areas or situations where male vaccinators face access constraints and restrictions, women doing the work have been more effective. This is especially true for conflict-affected areas of northern Nigeria where women are often the only ones allowed into households – especially those with young children – making their role irreplaceable,” said Dr Ndoutabe Modjirom, coordinator of WHO-led polio outbreaks rapid response team for the African region. “I manage it by separating my time to work [as a health worker] and do business.” Advertisement While the campaigns has improved public health outcomes, it has also unintentionally created a foundation for economic empowerment among women, many say. “Vaccination campaigns have opened a pathway for leadership, agency, and financial independence.” Helen Bulus, a government health officer in charge of vaccinations in Mararaba town in Nasarawa, reflects on the sense of commitment female health workers share. “As mothers become more economically stable, they invest more in their daughters’ futures.” A global model – with challenges While wild polio now remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Nigeria’s experience offers vital lessons.

Article: The letter, sent to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, said the three European powers were “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets a deadline to speak with them. “We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism,” the ministers wrote, the AFP news agency reported on Wednesday. Iran had been in talks with the United States at the time over its nuclear programme, before Washington later carried out its own bombing raid on Iran’s nuclear sites during the conflict. The foreign ministers of the so-called E3 group wrote to the UN on Tuesday, raising the prospect of “snapback” sanctions – a provision in a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that eased UN Security Council measures in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities. The letter follows what the E3 described as “serious, frank and detailed” discussions with Iran in Istanbul last month, the first in-person talks since Israeli and US strikes targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The European powers pledged to uphold the agreement but now claim Iran has breached its terms, including building a uranium stockpile more than 40 times the limit set in 2015. Meanwhile, Iran has agreed to hold talks with the IAEA and is preparing to host a visit by the UN watchdog, its first since Tehran cut ties with the agency last month following the June conflict.

Article: 27, Trump announced an executive order titled “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness.” It states that, “expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.” The order then continues to say, “beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.” On May 6, after a court challenge, the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration the ability to move forward with the order. That same day, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, delivered a keynote speech at Special Operations Forces Week 2025, that was clipped and posted in a public video on the verified X account for DOD Rapid Response, and said, “We are leaving wokeness and weakness behind. A transcript posted on the DOD’s website on the same day, that cited a “Senior Defense Official” without listing their name, explained that those who chose to leave would be compensated based on “rank as well as time in service.” The DOD transcript explained further, that all transgender personnel who leave because of this will receive some benefits, but that it is greater for those who start the process on their own accord. The way the voluntary separation pay is calculated is a multiple of two from the involuntary, so that E-5 with 10 years would be approximately $101,000 and the O-3 with seven years in service would be approximately $125,000,” the transcript said. 7, however, it was reported by NBC News that the Air Force is denying early retirement to all transgender service members with between 15 and 18 years of military service, opting instead to force them out with no retirement benefits, according to a memo seen by Reuters. They are not tied specifically to the implementation of this policy.” Savoie told NBC San Diego they chose to stay, and not begin that voluntary separation process, as an act of resistance. We don’t know what they’re going to do to us right now.” Savoie said they do have concerns for the future, including which separation code will be used for them if they are forced to leave the Marines and how that could impact their future employment opportunities. NBC San Diego reached out to Savoie’s command and the public affairs team for the USMC Manpower and Reserve Affairs office for more information on their status, as well as the status of other transgender servicemembers. When it comes to how many servicemembers, including Savoie, may be impacted by Trump's executive order, in that transcript, the unnamed senior defense official said, “the Department has cited a previous study that estimated approximately 4,200 service members with gender dysphoria. And of course, that may not be current as of today because service members are entering and departing service in the normal course of events all the time.” Savoie echoed that, saying “there’s not great numbers on how many transgender people are in the military." "From the communities that I am a part of and my experience working and connecting with other trans service members, I would guesstimate there’s maybe seven or eight transgender officers in the Marine Corps," they said. Others are taking the retirement and just kind of want to gracefully exit because they’ve already done their part and they’ve had to fight their fights under the first ban, and they’re tired.” If it were up to Savoie — who has continues to show up for work each day, unsure of what comes next — they said they would serve until their EAS, or end of active service, in 2028.

"I think one of the reasons why we're so blessed is that for the majority of our staff it is a calling.” At Carol Holt, that doesn’t only apply to teachers.

Riots across England and Northern Ireland last summer were partly triggered by misinformation on social media, which said the man responsible for the murder of three girls in Southport was an illegal migrant. When a car drove into a crowd at a bus parade for Liverpool FC in the city in May, police were quick to say a white man had been arrested over the incident to defuse any trouble. PA Media An anti-immigration protest - and a counter protest - took place in Nuneaton last week as tensions rose over the alleged 'cover-up', which police vehemently denied The guidance says if someone is arrested, officers should provide only the suspect's sex and age. One Metropolitan Police officer told the BBC: "Stating whether someone is black or brown could fuel the far-right and racism towards certain communities, rather than calm it down." Another said it was important not to disclose more information than is necessary to avoid influencing a future trial - although revealing a suspect's race and nationality is unlikely to do this.

Article: A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren’t very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned. "People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat," said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University. “There has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date," said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.

Article: The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite scored fresh record highs on Tuesday, as expectations of a lower overnight lending rate from the Federal Reserve reawakened animal spirits on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs also pointed out that this latest run to all-time highs coincides with increased retail participation by Main Street investors — which could signal it's time to delve into meme stocks once again. "Recent weeks have seen a resumption of retail buying activity in S & P 500 and [Nasdaq] 100 stocks, and we believe the meme stock resurgence has spread into the broader buying of large-cap stocks," strategist John Marshall wrote. According to Goldman, among the S & P 500 stocks that have seen high retail participation over the past month in terms of net retail activity are the following: Palantir — $1.2 billion AMD — $774 million KeyCorp — $163 million Electronic Arts — $42 million Albemarle — $19 million UPS — $123 million Warner Bros Discovery — $167 million Marshall recommended clients buy call options on these stocks with high retail participation. Professional investors have also stepped up their participation through the futures/swaps/options channels … and we see further upside, as the case for a September rate cut is more likely," Marshall said.

Article: As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares for a summit in Alaska with his United States counterpart Donald Trump, he can draw on his experiences from 48 previous meetings with American presidents. While some of the earlier meetings were relatively warm, reflecting the hopes of US-Russia friendship between the end of the Cold War and the early 2000s, most of Putin’s more recent interactions — especially with Obama and Biden — have been frostier, as bilateral ties have worsened. Under President Putin, Russia has the chance to build prosperity and strength, while safeguarding that freedom and the rule of law,” Clinton said, referring to Boris Yeltsin, Putin’s predecessor as president. But Clinton acknowledged their differences over Chechnya, where Russian forces had launched a major war the previous year, after a series of apartment blasts in Russia killed more than 300 people. The Moscow meeting was the first of four between Putin and Clinton in 2000, the others on the margins of multilateral events, before the US president left office in January the following year. Now the high school students can know Russia as a friend; that we’re working together to break the old ties, to establish a new spirit of cooperation and trust so that we can work together to make the world more peaceful,” Bush said. April 2008: Putin-Bush The final meeting between Bush and Putin as presidents took place in Sochi, Russia, and was focused on US plans to expand a missile defence system in Europe that Russia was opposing. “We may not end up agreeing on everything, but I think that we can have a tone of mutual respect and consultation that will serve both the American people and the Russian people well,” Obama told Putin. June 2013: Putin-Obama As Obama met Putin on the margins of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland — Russia had been added to the grouping in 1998 and was expelled in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea — their frustration with each other was visible in an awkward photo that made headlines. “With respect to Syria, we do have differing perspectives on the problem, but we share an interest in reducing the violence; securing chemical weapons and ensuring that they’re neither used nor are they subject to proliferation,” Obama said. Putin and Obama spoke for barely four minutes on the sidelines of the summit, with the US president asking his Russian counterpart to stick to his commitments under the Minsk agreements that were meant to bring peace to Ukraine. July 2018: Putin-Trump A year and a half into his first presidency, Trump’s victory in the 2016 US presidential election was still clouded by accusations that Russia had interfered in the election on his behalf when he met Putin in Helsinki. After he acknowledged that he had discussed the allegations of election interference with Putin, Trump was asked whether he believed US intelligence agencies that had concluded that Moscow had intervened in the vote. But Biden was also blunt with Putin about US concerns over Russian election interference and cyberattacks, and said he had, in effect, threatened Moscow that Washington could launch tit-for-tat cyberstrikes. Russia by then was building up its troop presence along the border with Ukraine, a key source of stress in ties with the US that came up during the Putin-Biden meeting. Eight months later, Russia would launch a fully fledged invasion of Ukraine, marking the start of Europe’s largest war since World War II — a war Trump says he wants to end through the summit in Alaska on August 15.

Article: BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday will consider an unprecedented lawsuit in which the Trump administration sued all 15 Maryland-based federal judges over a standing order related to deportation cases. The case is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's war on the judiciary, which has been marked by criticism of judges who have ruled against the government over President Donald Trump's bold and aggressive use of executive power. At issue is a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that set rules for handling cases involving immigrants facing immediate risk of deportation. One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country before eventually being returned, arose in Maryland. In court filings, Justice Department lawyers under Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the order "harms the federal government's sovereign interests on a repeated and ongoing basis" because it applies even when the immigrant may have no valid legal argument or the court has no jurisdiction over the case.

Article: In its absence, the president can paint the world as he pleases.” The same report added, “Curating reality is an old political game, but Trump’s sweeping statistical purges are part of a broader attempt to reinvent ‘truth.’” It’s difficult to do a full accounting of what has gone missing, but we know the list includes climate data, education data, trade data and crime data — all of which has been buried, deliberately, because the figures were deemed politically inconvenient. The Washington Post reported: President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics told Fox News Digital on Monday that the agency should suspend monthly jobs reports, a change that could leave businesses and policymakers at least temporarily without the data they’ve used for decades to gauge the state of the labor market and broader economy. “Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data,” Antoni said, referring to recent revisions to monthly reports. rely on these numbers, and a lack of confidence in the data has far-reaching consequences.” (Antoni’s interview with Fox News Digital was apparently taped on Monday but published Tuesday, after Trump announced that he was nominating the Heritage Foundation economist to lead the BLS.) The argument is badly flawed, in part because releasing the data quarterly, instead of monthly, leaves everyone in the dark for much of the year, and in part because of the underlying motivation: If the goal is to address “a lack of confidence in the data,” the president wouldn’t have fired a highly qualified and widely respected BLS chief in the first place, only to replace her with an unqualified partisan loyalist. Nevertheless, after Antoni’s comments to Fox News Digital circulated, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt whether the administration would, in fact, start limiting public access to U.S. “Well, look, what I’ll tell you about the Bureau of Labor Statistics — I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said. “And there has certainly been a decline in the quality and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there’s been an increase in revisions,” Leavitt added. Third, the White House continues to talk about revisions to government statistics in a way that makes it seem as if Trump administration officials don’t understand the underlying policy details at a basic level. In recent weeks, many have voiced concerns about the president and his team possibly manipulating official data, but now there’s a new concern: What if they limit access to the data for months on end?

Article: Teen influencer on fundraising mission stranded in Antarctica since landing without permission SANTIAGO, Chile -- What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with "false flight plan data." Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q - a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge's ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was "relieved by the outcome." For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. "I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission." The prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his "aircraft security and personal maintenance" during his stay at the military facility.

That is a claim denied by those at the Parc des Princes, who believe the salary offered would have made Donnarumma one of the highest paid goalkeepers in the world.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli gunfire killed at least 25 people seeking aid Wednesday, health officials and witnesses said, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will “allow” Palestinians to leave during an upcoming military offensive in Gaza. President Donald Trump’s vision of relocating much of Gaza’s population of over 2 million people through what the prime minister refers to as “voluntary migration” — and what critics have warned could be ethnic cleansing. First, from combat zones, and also from the Strip if they want,” Netanyahu said in an interview aired Tuesday with i24, an Israeli TV station, to discuss the planned offensive in some of the territory’s most populated areas including Gaza City. “We are not pushing them out but allowing them to leave.” READ MORE: Israel is in talks to possibly resettle Palestinians from Gaza in South Sudan Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals, which received the bodies, said people were killed on their way to aid distribution sites and while awaiting convoys entering the strip. Israel has said it will widen its military offensive against Hamas to the areas of Gaza that it does not yet control, where most of the territory’s residents have sought refuge. Netanyahu was asked by i24 News if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal and he responded that he wanted all of the hostages back, alive and dead. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce. Hamas has long called for a comprehensive deal but says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The office of Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Sharren Haskel, said Wednesday that she was arriving in South Sudan for a series of meetings in the first visit by a senior government official to the country, but she did not plan to broach the subject of moving Palestinians. Killed while seeking aid Among those killed while seeking aid Wednesday were 14 Palestinians in the Teina area approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from a food distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to staff at Nasser hospital. Gaza’s Health Ministry says 106 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war and 129 adults have died since late June when the ministry started to count deaths among this age group. and its humanitarian partners are doing everything possible to bring aid into Gaza, Dujarric said, but still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities who prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed. The offensive has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.

Bathed in sunshine, dozens of demonstrators drank tea, ate cake featuring a meme of the vice president’s face and held up humorous placards Tuesday in the small community in the Cotswolds, as this part of the countryside is known. Leon Neal / Getty Images “JD Vance Netflix password is ‘password,’” said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London. “Cotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,” another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year’s presidential race. Leon Neal / Getty Images In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance’s motorcade. Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was “getting bored” with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by “a disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.” Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds’ picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries. Chipping Norton and its surrounding area are known for the “Chipping Norton set,” including former Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha Cameron; Elizabeth Murdoch, media executive and daughter of Rupert Murdoch; and more recently, comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. Former "Top Gear" presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s “Diddly Squat Farm” in Chadlington is also nearby, and he shared an image on Instagram which highlighted how his farm is under a no-fly zone over the Cotswolds.

Article: In its second quarterly financial results as a public company, CoreWeave reported an adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, compared to a 21-cent loss per share expected by analysts polled by LSEG. "We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday," wrote analysts at Stifel, referencing the recent acquisition of Core Scientific. CoreWeave also lifted 2025 revenue guidance to between $5.15 billion and $5.35, up from a $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion forecast provided in May and above a $5.05 billion estimate.

Article: CRWV 1D mountain CRWV, 1-day Some analysts said that the move lower could be tied to lock-up expiration effective at the close of the market on Thursday – when insiders will be allowed to start selling shares following the company's March initial public offering – which could also affect CoreWeave's planned takeover of Core Scientific . "This could have direct implications for the announced all-stock acquisition of CORZ as the implied valuation is directly tied to the performance of CRWV's stock," said Citizens JMP analyst Greg Miller, who rates CoreWeave a market perform. "As such, we believe any downward pressure resulting from increased share supply or insider selling could affect the deal dynamics and increase investor opposition." While the lock-up expiration adds one element of uncertainty, investors may also be questioning CoreWeave's operating cash flow and planned capital spending, which "again disappointed in-quarter," Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow (equal weight) said. "Bottom line, accruing and expanding large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provide strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning for the ramping GPU build-out, broadening the customer base likely proves key to increasing investor confidence in the durability of this growth. … While we remain on the sidelines awaiting further evidence of the broadening of the software story at CoreWeave, for investors with strong conviction in the build-out of the GPU economy and longer-term investment horizons, CRWV should be considered as a core holding." JPMorgan: Overweight, $135 Analyst Mark Murphy's target calls for more than 9% downside compared with where CoreWeave closed Tuesday. Though a strong revenue performance, the booking/capex figures were not as spectacular with incremental backlog additions (ex previously announced OpenAI contract) at just $200M, while profitability was mixed (EBIT beat but EBIT $s reiterated for the full year on higher spending). That said, guidance implies a significant ramp in capex/revenue acceleration in Q4 which is likely driven by Blackwell and significant data capacity online, which we see as a positive catalyst ahead. … we'd expect shares to be volatile but expect weakness to be bought with AI demand remaining strong and revenue acceleration ahead." Bank of America: neutral, $168 Analyst Brad Sills' target implies about 13% upside. "While the magnitudes of the Q2 topline beat and Q3 raise were slightly below the Q1 print, results were solid, validating that CoreWeave remains well positioned as a leading AI infrastructure vendor. … the lockup expires on Friday, which is likely to place pressure on the shares … we believe CoreWeave remains well positioned to benefit from a ramping AI infrastructure industry." Stifel: hold, $120 Analyst Ruben Roy's target would equal more than 19% downside. "We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday."

Article: The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced a new "PreCheck" program, which will use a two-phase approach to help boost domestic drug manufacturing after it shrunk dramatically over the past two decades. The White House also estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it previously called "unacceptable from a national-security standpoint." "Our gradual overreliance on foreign drug manufacturing has created national security risks," FDA Commissioner Dr. "The FDA PreCheck initiative is one of many steps FDA is taking that can help reverse America's reliance on foreign drug manufacturing and ensure that Americans have a resilient, strong, and domestic drug supply." Here's how the two phases of the program work: Facility Readiness Phase: Drugmakers will be able to engage more frequently with the FDA at "critical development stages" such as facility design, construction and pre-construction, the agency said. Application Submission Phase: The agency said this step would involve the FDA and drugmakers holding pre-application meetings and giving early feedback to resolve issues and streamline assessments of "quality information in a drug application and inspections." (That is referring to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC, section of an application, which provides a comprehensive overview on the drug substance, its manufacturing process and controls in place to ensure its quality and stability.) The FDA will host a public meeting on Sept.

Article: Turkiye has said that Israel and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) must stop threatening the security and stability of Syria as Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan hosted his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara. Speaking at a joint news conference on Wednesday, Fidan accused Israel and the SDF of wilfully undermining the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive. “If you try to destabilise these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.” Al-Shaibani said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts”. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s fledgling government has been beset by heavy fallout from sectarian violence that broke out on July 13 in the southern province of Suwayda between Bedouin and Druze fighters. Israel had been regularly bombarding Syria and staging ground excursions into Syria since al-Assad’s ouster, saying it was targeting weapons sites and branding the leaders of the new government as “extremists”. The clashes cast further doubt over an integration deal signed in March by the armed group and Syria’s Damascus as part of efforts to reunite the country, devastated and divided by the ruinous war that saw hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced. The Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that the SDF must abide by that accord and stop targeting government forces, warning that “the continuation of these actions will lead to new consequences”, the SANA state news agency reported. Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an “opportunity for themselves.” Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG) affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that recently began disarmament as part of a peace process with Turkiye after more than 40 years of fighting in a conflict that killed more than 40,000 people. ”The upper echelons of the YPG need to stop playing for time because the chaos they’re waiting for [in Syria] will not take place, and even if it does, it will not be to their advantage.” Fidan said.

Article: When artist Amy Sherald canceled her LGBTQ-inclusive Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery show “American Sublime” last month, it was just the latest in a series of censorship episodes involving LGBTQ art at major American museums this year. The group show was to have included works inspired by Gosine’s 2021 book, “Nature’s Wild: Love, Sex and Law in the Caribbean,” which reflects on art, activism and homosexuality in the region. The same month, Arizona’s Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art made eleventh-hour edits to a traveling exhibition of women, queer and trans artists, which had previously been called “transfeminisms,” altering the title of its condensed show to “There are other skies.” Marinna Shareef with Andil Gosine's "God of Whimsy" https://www.paulpetro.com/exhibitions/674-nature-s-wild-with-andil-gosine In April, the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art postponed a group exhibition of works by LGBTQ African artists titled “Here: Pride and Belonging in African Art,” which had been scheduled for a late May opening to coincide with WorldPride. museum cited budgetary reasons for postponing the show to 2026, but the timing was hard to miss on the heels of Trump administration directives to the Smithsonian to remove “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from its museums — as well as the forced and pre-emptive relocation of other WorldPride cultural events after Trump administration firings at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Katz was the lead curator for “The First Homosexuals: The Birth of a New Identity, 1869-1939,” the vast and successful historical survey of LGBTQ art that ran through early July at Chicago’s Wrightwood 659 Gallery. Katz traces the roots of modern queer art censorship to the controversial Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition “The Perfect Moment,” which — with its provocative imagery, much of it homoerotic — became a cultural lightning rod at the height of the Reagan/Bush-era culture wars in 1989-90. Al Behrmann / AP file Central to the cancellation of Sherald’s show was her painting “Trans Forming Liberty,” which features a Black trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty. After she learned that the National Portrait Gallery had “internal concerns” about the painting and planned to replace or supplement it with a video to provide “both sides” of its trans subject matter, Sherald balked and canceled her entire show, which would have been the museum’s first solo exhibition by a Black contemporary artist. “While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald, who rose to fame when she painted former first lady Michelle Obama’s official portrait, said in a statement after the cancellation. “At a time when transgender people are being legislated against, silenced, and endangered across our nation, silence is not an option.” After the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, which oversees the gallery, disputed Sherald’s claims and said that the institution wanted more time to better contextualize the painting but that Sherald canceled before that could be done. “She’s willing to do it, she’s got the strength to do it, and I think it’s extraordinary.” The National Portrait Gallery is one of eight Smithsonian museums targeted as part of the first phase of an expansive review announced by the Trump administration on Tuesday. The review will analyze all aspects of current and future museum exhibitions to ensure alignment with the president’s March executive order calling for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” Gustave Caillebotte's "Boat Party" is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. Sophie Crépy / Musée d’Orsay In June, across town from “The First Homosexuals,” the Art Institute of Chicago opened a traveling exhibition of 19th century French artist Gustave Caillebotte’s male-focused and arguably homoerotic work, changing the show’s name from “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men” to “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World.” Wall texts accompanying the artworks at the Art Institute take a more general approach than they had at the exhibition’s previous incarnations at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, where frank discussions of gender and sexuality were included. “That one was particularly galling, because not only did the show coincide with my show, but I wrote for the catalog of that exhibition precisely how one talks about same-sex desire in Caillebotte’s work,” Katz said. We’re asking them to leave open the possibility, and to foreground the blurriness of these questions in the late 19th century.” In a statement to NBC News, the Art Institute of Chicago said its “Painting His World” title is more illustrative of what people will see when they come to the exhibition, which “reflects Caillebotte’s full lived experience and daily life, including his personal relationships with the men in his life, like his brother, colleagues, and friends.” The institute added that it’s “common practice” for the same exhibition to have differing titles and wall labels when it’s at different museums. The Smithsonian National Museum of African Art — which was not included in the Trump administration’s Phase I review — said in a statement on Tuesday that the postponement of its LGBTQ exhibition was due to private funding challenges and that pushing it back to early 2026 “provide the museum additional time to increase fundraising for the exhibit.” The Art Museum of the Americas and Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art did not immediately respond to NBC News’ requests for comment regarding their canceled and altered exhibits. “So I think it’s about trying to pacify a class of oligarchs that by and large run these museums, for whom questions of explicit uncensored sexuality are frankly anathema to their values.” Fortunately for Katz and Willis — and Chicago audiences — the innovative exhibition space Wrightwood 659, just seven years old and committed to presenting socially engaged art, stepped up to host “The First Homosexuals” when virtually every other American museum turned it down. “Rave reviews, the last two months were sold out, waiting lists of 100-plus people — I mean, everything a museum could want, and yet no.” Instead, the exhibition will travel next to Switzerland’s Kunstmuseum Basel, where it will open in the spring. 25; and in Los Angeles, the Getty Center has a double feature of queer shows, “Queer Lens: A History of Photography” and $3 Bill: Evidence of Queer Lives, both on view through Sept. “These exhibitions do what we always hope an exhibition will do — bring visibility to lesser-known histories through the display of art to the public,” said Timothy Potts, director of the J.

Article: Lammy admits licence error on JD Vance fishing trip 44 minutes ago Share Save Joshua Nevett Political reporter Share Save Reuters Foreign Secretary David Lammy has admitted he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance and has blamed the oversight on an "administrative error". The agency says anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod fishing licence to fish for freshwater species and can be fined if they do not have one. The two men went carp fishing in a pond near the 17th-century house before they held talks about Gaza and other international affairs at the residence during Vance's family holiday to the UK. At the start of their meeting, the vice-president said: "Unfortunately, the one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not." All fish that were caught were returned to the private lake. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "The foreign secretary has written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week.

Article: President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social is a safe space for him and his movement, an autocrat-friendly network where the president’s posts — which are called “truths” on the platform — are praised effusively and largely go uncontested. I'm wondering how long it'll take before Truth Social will want to tell its AI: "You're fired." In exchanges with a Washington Post reporter, Truth Search AI undermined Trump by saying that "tariffs are a tax on Americans, the 2020 election wasn’t stolen, and his family’s cryptocurrency investments pose a potential conflict of interest." When asked to verify Trump's claim on Truth Social that crime in Washington, D.C., is "totally out of control," the bot cited government statistics and said there were in reality "substantial declines in violent crime" in D.C. Capitol by a pro‑Trump crowd that disrupted Congress’s certification of the 2020 Electoral College results, resulting in assaults on police, injuries, property damage, and hundreds of criminal cases ranging from misdemeanors to felonies." When I asked if it was appropriate to describe that as an insurrection or a coup, it responded, "Based on standard definitions, January 6 is best described as an attempted insurrection rather than a successful coup; it can also be framed as a failed coup attempt because the goal was to disrupt the lawful transfer of presidential power, but it lacked the organized seizure of state levers typical of coups." Surprisingly reasonable! The Washington Post reports that a spokesman for the AI company Perplexity, which developed the chat bot, said that "Truth Social had used a 'source selection' feature to limit the websites the AI tool relied on but that Perplexity did not know which websites those were." As a casual user experimenting with the product, I don't know either. But I did notice that in the "sources" section of the responses, the sources listed were almost always Fox News and The Washington Times, both right-wing outlets, and a far narrower range of sources than I've seen cited by other AI chatbots such as X's Grok. Elon Musk's quest to develop "anti-woke AI" involved turning his AI, Grok, into a full-fledged Nazi apologist and at the same time one that will deliver conventional liberal summaries of racism. The thing that stands out here is how out of place Truth Social's AI centrist- and liberal-friendly descriptions of events and policy feel on a platform awash in MAGA propaganda.

Article: Jan Hatzius has been Goldman Sachs’ chief economist for quite some time — he correctly warned, for example, about the systemic risks of mortgage defaults ahead of the 2008 crash — which has raised his public profile. The Wall Street Journal reported: President Trump on Tuesday appeared to call for Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon to replace the bank’s top economist over his past predictions, in his latest broadside against executives he believes are undermining his goals. Trump said on his Truth Social social-media platform that Solomon should ‘go out and get himself a new Economist’ because the bank made a ‘bad prediction a long time ago’ on the market and tariffs. As part of the same online missive, the Republican also wrote, “Trillions of Dollars are being taken in on Tariffs.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, tariffs have generated some revenue — roughly $152 billion through July — but to suggest this figure is “trillions of dollars” is bonkers. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Trump’s agenda is failing; or that “crediting” a president for failing doesn’t make any sense; or that the administration’s own data suggests Goldman Sachs’ assessments related to tariffs haven’t been “wrong” at all. The record suggests Hatzius has been correct — but even if he’d been wrong, it’s not Trump’s job to tell Goldman Sachs who should and shouldn’t serve as the bank’s chief economist. The Journal published a separate analysis last week that noted the Republican “has no qualms about acting as the micromanager in chief,” which includes “telling corporate bosses how to run their companies.” I haven’t seen any evidence that Goldman Sachs is taking Trump’s bizarre advice seriously, but the fact that the president even issued such a public statement was a timely reminder about his maximalist assumptions regarding the scope of his powers: Trump doesn’t just see himself as the head of the executive branch, he also apparently sees himself as the CEO of America.

Article: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has convened the virtual meetings in an attempt to make sure European and Ukraine’s leaders are heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where Trump and Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine. German government spokesperson Steffen Meyer said the intention of Wednesday’s meetings was to “make clear the position of the Europeans.” Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, in preparation for a virtual call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later. A call among leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — will take place last. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,” and urged Ukraine’s partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and “force Russia to peace.” “Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. READ MORE: Zelenskyy says Putin wants the rest of Ukraine’s Donetsk region as part of a ceasefire Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts. Ukrainian drones struck the Unecha station which supplies the Russian army, the statement said, adding that damage and a large fire was reported in the area around the pumping station.

"And we all know that if there's one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it's more of me." Swift has attended the past two Super Bowls to support her boyfriend, whose Chiefs won their second consecutive title in 2024 before losing earlier this year to the Eagles. Those Swift bashers might be having a particularly tough week with her name filling up news and social media spaces after announcing Wednesday the name of her upcoming 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl.” Her appearance on the football-centric podcast was hyped by a screaming Jason Kelce, calling Swift "the most requested guest in the history of shows!"

Article: A Palestinian man in the occupied West Bank has been shot dead in an attack instigated by Israeli settlers, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry as cited by the Wafa news agency. Thamin Khalil Reda Dawabsheh, 35, was shot Wednesday morning in the town of Duma, south of Nablus, by an Israeli off-duty soldier who was accompanying “an Israeli civilian” near Duma “during engineering works”, the Israeli army said. pic.twitter.com/cHfdUg4Unl — WAFA News Agency – English (@WAFANewsEnglish) August 13, 2025 According to the mayor of Duma, Palestinians in the town were “startled” by an Israeli settler attack, said Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim. Suleiman Dawabsheh, the head of the Duma village council, said that settlers attacked Palestinians and opened fire on them in the southern part of the village, amid land-levelling operations that have been taking place in the area for days, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The statement published by the Israeli army claimed dozens of Palestinians were hurling rocks towards the Israeli civilian and soldier, and “in response, the soldier fired to remove the threat, and a hit was identified”. A deadly pattern of Israeli military, settler attacks Recently, 31-year-old Palestinian activist and English teacher Awdah Hathaleen was shot dead by an Israeli settler on July 28 in the village of Umm al-Kheir, south of Hebron. Hathaleen was well known for his activism, including helping the creators of the Oscar-winning film No Other Land, which documents Israeli settler and soldier attacks on the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta. Violent attacks by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the occupied West Bank have surged since October 2023, in tandem with Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, with the United Nations reporting that almost 650 Palestinians – including 121 children – have been killed in the territory by Israeli forces and settlers between January 1, 2024 and the start of July 2025.

"Only Betro knows what truly motivated her or what she sought to gain from becoming embroiled in a crime that meant she travelled hundreds of miles from Wisconsin to Birmingham to execute an attack on a man she did not know," Hannah Sidaway, specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service West Midlands, said in a statement. Authorities said she tried to pass herself off as a tourist, posting pictures and videos of landmarks, but “her real purpose was to commit murder.” Police said she met up with Nazir, who allegedly recruited her to carry out the attack after meeting her on a dating app.

Article: London chess prodigy, 10, becomes master player 19 minutes ago Share Save Share Save BBC Bodhana was selected for England Women's chess team in 2024 A 10-year-old chess prodigy from north-west London has become the youngest person to earn the woman international master title. In 2024 Bodhana was thought to have become the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport when she was selected for England Women's Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary. Her father Siva previously told the BBC he had no idea where his daughter got her talent from as neither he or his wife, both engineering graduates, are any good at chess. The International Chess Federation said on its social media account on X that Bodhana "pulled off the win against 60-year-old Grandmaster Peter Wells in the last round of the 2025 British Chess Championships in Liverpool". The federation added: "Sivanandan's victory at 10 years, five months and three days beats the 2019 record held by American Carissa Yip (10 years, 11 months and 20 days)." Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain and the rank is held for life. "When it was 2020, it was Covid, so one of my dad's friends was going back to India, and he had a few toys and books, and he gave them to us. He said: "I try to trace down whether any of my cousins or anyone plays - nobody has any chess energy or chess-playing skills, no one played for any chess events." He added: "Overall we are happy with whatever is happening. Bodhana played several games simultaneously at Chess Fest 2024 in Trafalgar Square Malcolm Payne, an international chess master who runs a charity that's brought the game to a quarter-of-a-million state school children, said Bodhana was blazing a trail for girls and women in what has traditionally been a man's game. And certainly I believe that she's on course to become a grandmaster." Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

De Waal worries that Ethiopia might, once again, showcase the impact of FEWS NET, this time highlighting the effect of the temporary shutdown.

Simons said in addition to coffee, the shop is paying increased prices on avocados and tomatoes. The Administration does have a policy to accommodate this reality in some instances, but it's still a work in progress." Anjali Bhargava, founder of Anjali's Cup, which makes retail spice packages of Ayurveda-inspired turmeric and chai blends, said nearly all of their caffeine sources come from abroad. "Small, bootstrapped brands that prioritize integrity and authenticity could be squeezed out entirely." Bhargava is concerned about the 50% tariff on tea from India, and said at the retailers where her product is sold, like Whole Foods, there is little room for major price changes. "The 50% tariff on tea, not to mention the tariffs on my spices and other necessities, will devastate my already slim margins and could force me to raise prices that customers are already balking at, given the leverage my large competitors have." Bhargava has made concessions on her packaging, which was manufactured in China, but told CNBC she refuses to compromise on ingredients. I can't afford to stockpile like my larger competitors, especially given how unlevel the playing field already is." There are concerns as well that the impact of tariffs will flow further onto grocery stores into other products. That could be further amplified by the cuts to the SNAP program by the Big Beautiful Bill, all of which is leading to lower forecasts from retailers, according to Heather Rice, who leads the consumer, retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, and life science practice at KPMG.

Article: Clashes have erupted as opponents and supporters of the Serbian government faced off, each side staging its own demonstrations, as sustained protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic have now gone on for more than nine months. The clashes first began on Tuesday night in Vrbas, northwest of the capital Belgrade, where riot police separated the two groups outside the governing Serbian Progressive Party offices in the town. The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 16 people, triggering furious accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects. Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China, and has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms since coming to power 13 years ago.

Article: At least 123 Palestinians, including 21 people seeking aid, have been killed and 437 others were injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, according to the Health Ministry in the besieged territory. In the same period, at least eight people, including three children, died from Israeli-imposed starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total number of hunger-related deaths since the war began in October, 2023 to 235, among them 106 children, the ministry said on Wednesday. “This is in addition to: over 40,000 children reported killed or injured due to bombardment and airstrikes, at least 17,000 unaccompanied and separated children, and one million deeply traumatised children and out of education,” he wrote in a post on X. No one should stay silent when children die, or are brutally deprived of a future, wherever these children are, including in Gaza.” Ceasefire talks to restart As the death toll continues to rise in Gaza, a delegation from the Palestinian group Hamas was scheduled to begin discussions in Egypt over a potential ceasefire on Wednesday. The previous round of indirect ceasefire talks in Qatar ended in deadlock in late July, after Israel and the United States withdrew their delegations hours after Hamas submitted its response to a truce proposal. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the news agency Reuters that “Hamas believes negotiation is the only way to end the war and is open to discuss any ideas that would secure an end to the war”. Advertisement A Hamas representative also told Reuters the group was willing to hand over governance of Gaza to a non-partisan committee, but would not give up its weapons before a Palestinian state is established. Israeli military plan to seize Gaza City Israel’s security cabinet last week approved plans to take control of Gaza City, despite international condemnation from the United Nations and dissent from within Israel’s own military. However, earlier Wednesday, the military said its chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, had signed off on the “main framework” for the operational plan during a meeting with top commanders, Shin Bet representatives and senior officers. According to the statement, Zamir “emphasised the importance of increasing troop readiness and preparedness for reserve recruitment, while conducting proficiency training and providing breathing space ahead of the upcoming missions”. “Seven people were reported killed overnight from a mixture of heavy artillery and air strikes targeting major residential clusters.” In the city’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, three more people were reportedly killed as they fled the area. Mahmoud said the Zikim crossing, the main entry point for aid in northern Gaza, had become “deadly for Palestinians”, with limited aid trucks allowed through despite crowds of desperate people. Aid restrictions criticised Foreign ministers from 24 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and Japan, said on Tuesday the humanitarian crisis in Gaza had reached “unimaginable levels” and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid into the enclave. But UNRWA says 500–600 trucks of aid are needed daily, but that aid getting into the Strip remains a fraction of that figure – while many Palestinians are killed on their way to collect aid.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, embracing his new role as chairman of the Kennedy Center, was set to be on hand Wednesday as the recipients of its annual award are announced and both he and the performing arts venue hint at coming renovations to its building. He said work was being done on the site that would be “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. In a statement on its social media feed, the Kennedy Center said it is “honored” to host Trump, who will be visiting for the third time since January, and hinted that he would announce a construction project. “We are also excited to be announcing this year’s INCREDIBLE slate of Kennedy Center Honorees.” Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” It is unclear how this year's honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill that Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Clashes erupted at protests in Serbia between opponents and supporters of the government in an escalation of tensions following more than nine months of persistent demonstrations against populist President Aleksandar Vucic. The skirmishes first started on Tuesday evening in Vrbas, northwest of the capital Belgrade, where riot police separated protesters from the opposing camps outside the governing Serbian Progressive Party offices in the town.

Vucic said at a news conference on Wednesday with Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker that pro-democracy protests in Serbia have been “very violent and were violent last night.” Serbia’s president, other government officials and pro-government media repeatedly have described the protesters as “terrorists,” though protests in Serbia since November have been largely peaceful.

Article: This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as inspirations on policy and tactics. Tuesday’s polling milestone is “a sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,” said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England’s University of Birmingham. Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe’s top three economies is “a first — at least in modern times.” Reform U.K. Ben Stansall / AFP - Getty Images There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries’ next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later. Michel Euler / AP file More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group.

Article: In the face of blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle on Wednesday stood by a controversial forecast that tariffs will begin to hit consumer wallets. "We stand by the results of this study," he said on "Squawk on the Street." "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two thirds of the cost." The source of the president's ire was a Goldman note over the weekend, authored by economist Elsie Peng, asserting that while exporters and businesses thus far have absorbed most of Trump's tariffs, that burden will switch in the months ahead to consumers. If that's the case, it will push the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's main inflation forecasting gauge, to 3.2% by the end of the year, excluding food and energy. "So those are our estimates, and I think actually, they're quite consistent with what many other economists have found." Of note, Mericle said Trump likely still will get at least some of the interest rate cuts he's been demanding of the Fed. "I don't think this will matter a whole lot to the Fed, because now they have a labor market to worry about, and I think that's going to be the dominant concern." Following modest gains reported this week for the consumer price index, and a weak July nonfarm payrolls report that featured sharp downward revisions to the prior two months, markets are pricing in cuts from the Fed at each of its three remaining meetings this year.

An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General found that the company designed Zelle "without critical safety features," which allegedly allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. "EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks," a statement from the office read. The lawsuit alleged that Zelle became a "hub for fraudulent activity" because the registration process lacked verification steps and that EWS and its partner banks knew "for years" that fraud was spreading and did not take actionable steps to resolve it.

Article: An influential group of Eli Lilly insiders scooped up shares of the obesity drugmaker — a major show of confidence that has us warming back up to the beaten-up stock. If not for our trading restrictions, we would be repurchasing at least some of the shares we sold in late July at nearly $774 apiece, before the stock got crushed on disappointing trial data for its hotly anticipated obesity pill. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks and four other insiders at the company — two other executives and two members of the board of directors — purchased additional stock in the company. The buys were as follows, according to SEC filings: Ricks: $1,052,263.01 (1,632 shares at an average of $644.769 apiece) Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky: $634,405 (1,000 shares at an average of $634.405 apiece) Executive Ilya Yuffa: $783,762.5 (1,250 shares at an average of $627.01 apiece) Director Erik Erik Fyrwald: $1,005,242.35 (1,565 shares at an average of $642.32738 apiece) Director Gabrielle Sulzberger: $75,018.294 (117 shares at an average of $641.182 apiece) So, why does this matter? The CEO buying stock is one thing – yes, you only buy stock if you think it's going higher, but there is no denying that the CEO knows it will also send a positive signal to investors. A director can easily decide to not step in and nobody would bat an eye, especially a board member that is also the CEO of another well-known publicly traded company. So, the fact that Fyrwald did step in here and now, in our view, has nothing to do with sending a positive signal investors and everything to do with what he believes is an opportunity to make money.

Article: Retail and technology consulting company Coresight Research estimates that back-to-school spending from June through August will reach $33.3 billion in the U.S., a 3.3% increase from the same three-month period a year ago. “Consumers are of the mindset where they're being very strategic and conscientious around price fluctuations, so for back to school, it prompts them to shop even earlier,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, the research division of software company Adobe Inc. Getting a head start Miami resident Jacqueline Agudelo, 39, was one of the early birds who started shopping for school supplies in June because she wanted to get ahead of possible price increases from new U.S. Although government data showed consumer prices rose 2.7% last month from a year earlier, strategic discounting by major retailers may have muted any sticker shock for customers seeking school supplies. Backpacks and lunchboxes, for example, had discounts as deep as 12.1% during Amazon's Prime Day sales and competing online sales at Target and Walmart in early July, Adobe Insights said. An analysis consumer data provider Numerator prepared for The Associated Press showed the retail cost of 48 products a family with two school age children might need — two lunchboxes, two scientific calculators, a pair of boy’s shoes — averaged $272 in July, or $3 less than the same month last year. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from 200,000 shoppers, reported last year that households were buying fewer notebooks, book covers, writing instruments and other familiar staples as students did more of their work on computers. TeacherLists, an online platform where individual schools and teachers can upload their recommended supply lists and parents can search for them, was launched in 2012 to reduce the need for paper lists. Enter artificial intelligence For consumers who like to research their options before they buy, technology and retail companies have introduced generative AI tools to help them find and compare products. Rufus, the AI-powered shopping assistant that Amazon launched last year, is now joined by Sparky, an app-only feature that Walmart shoppers can use to get age-specific product recommendations and other information in response to their questions. adults say they use AI for shopping, which is considerably lower than the number who say they use AI for tasks such as searching for information or brainstorming, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in July. Some traditions remain Before the pandemic turned a lot more people into online shoppers, schools and local Parent Teacher Associations embraced the idea of making back-to-school shopping easier by ordering ready-made bundles of teacher-recommended supplies. Market data from Edukit, a supplier of school supply kits owned by TeachersList parent company School Family Media, shows that about 40% of parents end up buying the boxes, meaning the other 60% need to shop on their own, Griffin said.

Article: At least 20 people have died in a shipwreck off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, and a United Nations agency says more refugees and migrants could be missing as search operations continue. Rescue services on Wednesday found 20 bodies, while 60 survivors, 56 men and four women, were brought ashore to Lampedusa, according to the Italian Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In February, Libyan authorities uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, in the latest horror involving people seeking to make it to Europe through the North African country. An Italian law enforcement aircraft spotted a capsized boat with bodies in the water about 23km (14 miles) off Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, triggering a rescue operation, a source close to the matter told the Reuters news agency. Cristina Palma, who works for the Italian Red Cross in Lampedusa, said in a video statement that the survivors were in “decent” health, but four of them had been hospitalised for checks. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing government has vowed to block the refugee and migrant sea journeys from Africa and has passed measures against human smugglers, including tougher jail terms, and has urged allies to do more to curb the migration attempts.

Article: Trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq begins in Bangladesh 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save PA Media The trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq over corruption allegations has formally begun in Bangladesh. The former minister did not attend the hearing, where investigators from the country's corruption watchdog set out the case against her and 20 other individuals, including her aunt, her mother, her brother and her sister. She is accused of influencing her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladesh's prime minister last year, to secure a plot of land in a suburb of the capital Dhaka for her family members. A copy of the case alleges that whilst she was a serving MP Ms Siddiq "forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq". As per Bangladeshi law, if an individual has any plot or flat in or around Dhaka, they are not permitted to receive any plot in the lucrative Purbachal project, prosecutors said. The prosecutor for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Tariqul Islam, said Ms Siddiq was being tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as the ACC found her Bangladeshi passport, national ID, and tax identity number. Ms Siddiq's lawyers previously told the Financial Times: "Tulip has never had a Bangladesh national identity card or voter ID and has not held a passport since she was a child." In a statement on X, Ms Siddiq said: "Over the past year, the allegations against me have repeatedly shifted, yet I have never been contacted by the Bangladeshi authorities once. "Instead, they have peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators." She added: "I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Reuters Prosecutor Tariqul Islam spoke to the media outside the court in Dhaka Ms Siddiq resigned as Treasury minister in Sir Keir Starmer's government in January, saying continuing in her role would be a "distraction", although she insisted she had done nothing wrong. The ACC is also investigating a separate case against Siddiq and her family over allegations of embezzlement of £3.9bn connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal with Bangladesh in 2013.

Police Union, despite caveats that “federal intervention must be a temporary measure,” is disturbingly gung-ho about its members receiving this unchecked power to execute what many critics see as a racist campaign against a largely Black city that could spread to others nationally. Echoing Trump, Union Chairman Gregg Pemberton claimed crime is out of control during a Fox News interview, a claim the union and the administration have boosted repeatedly via social media. Alex Brandon / AP file Pemberton and the union also claimed last month that a police commander manipulated data to overstate the decline in crime, according to the local NBC affiliate, although the union hasn’t provided any public evidence to support the claim.

Article: Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer whose scandal in 2017 was pivotal in drawing global attention to the #MeToo movement, will be tried for a third time by New York prosecutors in the sexual assault case of Jessica Mann. The same jury found Weinstein guilty in June of sexually assaulting former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and not guilty of assaulting Polish former runway model Kaja Sokola that same year. The foreman told the court that one of the other jurors threatened him and told him: "You know me; you going to see me outside." The foreman then refused to continue deliberations on the final charge, prompting prosecutors to move for a mistrial. Weinstein, who co-founded global film studios Miramax and The Weinstein Company, was originally convicted of rape and criminal sexual act by the same court in 2020 and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the crimes. The state Court of Appeals found that the judge in the 2020 trial prejudiced the jury by allowing women with allegations that did not pertain to the case to testify.

Article: A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration late Tuesday night, ordering the government to partially restore science funding to UCLA in a major class action lawsuit filed by researchers from the University of California school system. District Judge Rita Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to reinstate suspended grants to UCLA, following a hearing on the case earlier that day over what the plaintiffs describe as the Trump administration’s “arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful” termination of research grants. The decision comes weeks after the Trump administration suspended some $584 million in federal grants for the school, roughly a third of which are from NSF, due to claims of inadequate handling of antisemitism on campus. “While we have not had an opportunity to review the court’s order and were not party to the suit, restoration of National Science Foundation funds is critical to research the University of California performs on behalf of California and the nation,” the statement said. The funding from the NSF could be worth over an estimated $101 million, across 306 grant projects, based on data maintained by Grant Witness, a project spearheaded by a group of researchers and volunteers that tracks the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration. Lin’s ruling follows the Trump administration’s allegations that UCLA had violated federal civil rights law by acting with “deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” To restore funding, the administration proposed a $1 billion settlement with UCLA last week. While the Trump administration argued in the Tuesday hearing that the UCLA cuts were “suspensions” rather than “terminations,” Lin wrote in her ruling that the difference in wording still produced the same effect. “NSF claims that it could simply turn around the day after the Preliminary Injunction issued, and halt funding on every grant that had been ordered reinstated, so long as that action was labeled as a ‘suspension’ rather than a ‘termination,’” she wrote. “This is not a reasonable interpretation of the scope of the Preliminary Injunction.” The class action lawsuit was filed in early June, and accused the Trump administration of unlawfully terminating or suspending previously approved grants in a series of cuts implemented through controversial then-Elon Musk headed agency the Department of Government Efficiency. A review of the grants terminated across the UC system by NSF, for example, appears to have taken place because the grant titles included the “now-suspect DEI-related words” like “equity,” the suit said. “Judge Lin readily understood that the suspension actions, like the prior terminations she had enjoined, unlawfully failed to contain grant-specific rationales for halting grants mid-stream,” Polsky said in an email.

Article: NEW YORK — Charlie Brown and Snoopy go to sleepaway camp in a new, bittersweet Apple TV+ special fueled by a pair of Emmy Award-nominated songwriters that's being billed as the first “Peanuts” musical in 35 years. “So it’s really an honor to get to play with these kids.” “Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical,” which premieres Friday, features five songs — two by Jeff Morrow, Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner — and three by Ben Folds. “You wake at dawn/Like you would in jail,” she sings in the song “A Place Like This.” “The food’s not what you’d call upscale/This whole endeavor, an epic fail/And that’s being diplomatic.” Trust “Peanuts” to explore reluctance to leave home and fear of change. “So many connections in the film kind of date back to my childhood that we weaved into the film.” While Sally warms to camp, Snoopy discovers what he thinks is a treasure map that will transform him into a wealthy pooch, one who will lay on top of a gold dog house. “We have to protect these kinds of places because once they’re gone, they’re gone forever.” A concert to save the camp Charlie Brown comes up with the idea to invite generations of camp-goers back for a fundraising concert, but the skies darken on the big day, threatening to cancel the event and sending him into a “Good grief” spiral. And so that’s why when we get to that scene it’s so effective because he returned back to the zero we sort of know him traditionally.” Folds supplies the lovely, last three songs — “When We Were Light,” “Look Up, Charlie Brown” and “Leave It Better” — and credits his songwriting collaborators for setting the stage. Folds has had a flirtation with musical theater before, having written the “Peanuts” Earth Day song “It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown” in 2022 and a few songs for the movie “Over the Hedge” in 2006. “Really what the value of the song is that it obviates the need for a good five to 10 pages of script.” This October marks the 75th anniversary of “Peanuts,” and the musical arrives with a boatload of branding, from tote bags by Coach to shoes by Crocs and Starbucks mugs. "I used to always wonder how in the world my dad could go to the office every day for 50 years and write a comic strip every day," he says, comparing it to the “I Love Lucy” episode with Lucy trying to keep up with a chocolate conveyor belt. “Then I came to realize that he had his family of five kids, but I really think he enjoyed going to the studio and working with the ‘Peanuts’ characters even more so than his real family.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The Texas Senate on Tuesday advanced a proposal to scrap STAAR, the end-of-the-year state standardized test that parents and teachers widely criticize for putting enormous pressure on students. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are considering similar bills to replace the state’s standardized test, signaling newfound agreement between chamber leaders on how to revamp STAAR, a task they left incomplete earlier this year. But the proposal — like every other bill under consideration during this year’s special legislative session — is in limbo in the lower chamber after Texas House Democrats fled the state over redistricting, depriving the chamber of the number of members required to advance any legislation. The special sessions provide legislators with another chance to revamp the test after negotiations between the House and Senate on STAAR broke down in the final hours of the regular session. They all remind me … they want … for us to eliminate the STAAR test,” House Speaker Dustin Burrows said last week as he called on his Democrat colleagues to return to Austin. For example, the bill requires the Texas Education Agency to create a year-end test that most students can complete in about an hour and a half — a significant change from the current test that often stretches for three hours. If the legislation is approved, TEA Commissioner Mike Morath said all test results would now be reported as percentile ranks, which indicate how a student’s performance compares to their peers. The bill would also: Require the TEA to release any rule changes to the accountability system by July 15 of any year, about a month before the school year starts. During the regular session, both chambers failed to find a middle ground on several fronts, including whether the Legislature or the TEA commissioner gets the final say on setting the ratings systems standards; how to deal with school districts that sue to block their accountability ratings; and whether to keep a mandatory social studies test. “I can't imagine there'd be opposition to this in any way.” The current STAAR test is designed to be completed in three hours, but testing sessions can go up to seven hours. Teachers also describe losing valuable instructional time to “teach to the test.” According to a Charles Butt Foundation survey of teachers across the state, about eight in 10 teachers said preparing for STAAR is a barrier to good teaching. Testing’s outsized influence on school ratings means SB 8 and HB 8 won’t ease the pressures on students, said Bob Popinski, with Raise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group that has pushed for a more comprehensive ratings system. “Where you have one test driving the A-F accountability ratings, that still is a high-stakes test, especially when it's still required right now for high school kids to pass in order to graduate.” The charge to create an effective standardized test has implications for the future of schools around the state.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The all-girls Christian summer camp where 27 people, most of them children, were swept away and killed by the July 4 flooding in Kerr County was just one of 13 summer camps along the Guadalupe River built on land prone to flooding. The two Camp Mystic cabins where most of the flood victims were sleeping are in the Guadalupe River floodway, an area along waterways considered to be the most hazardous during a flood. Twelve other summer camps along the river in Kerr and Kendall counties are at least partially built on land within the 100-year floodplain, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of flood and property maps along the Guadalupe River. You're not just putting yourself at risk, you're putting these children at risk who you're supposed to be looking out for their safety.” Five summer camps, including Mystic, have at least one-third of their camp structures located in the 100-year floodplain. The owner of Camp Waldemar, Meg Clark, testified before a legislative committee last week that all of its cabins are located on a bluff above the floodplain, allowing the camp to shelter in place until the river receded. The modeling used to map 100-year floodplains, which have a 1% chance of flooding in any given year, is out of date because it is based on rainfall totals that have increased in recent decades as the climate warms and the warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. The eight other summer camps with at least one-third of their structures located in the 100-year floodplain include: Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly in Hunt Bear Creek Scout Camp in Hunt Camp La Junta in Hunt Camp Rio Vista for Boys in Ingram Camp Sierra Vista for Girls in Ingram Camp Honey Creek For Girls in Hunt Kickapoo Kamp for Girls in Kerrville Hermann Sons Life Camp-Riverside in Comfort Camp La Junta evacuated all of its campers during the flooding and saw no injuries or deaths, according to a Facebook post. Camp Mystic, which opened in 1926 and has grandfathered status, successfully petitioned FEMA in 2013, 2019 and 2020 to remove some of its buildings from the 100-year flood map ahead of a camp expansion. Flood maps are “not really showing you the accurate risk, so you would think camps would go the extra mile to be extra careful knowing the floodwaters could very likely go far beyond those lines,” Pralle said. “Risks don't stop when they hit a line on a map, so the idea that it's somehow less risky if you're outside the flood zone is not true.” Lawmaker weigh bills on disaster, evacuation plans for camps Two special legislative committees appointed to come up with proposals in response to the July 4 weekend floods have mainly focused on disaster response rather than floodplain building regulations. The House committee passed House Bill 19, which would require any property with cabins or designated spaces for camping to develop a "flood disaster plan." The bill doesn't stipulate what exactly the plan has to include, leaving that up to the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Texas Floodplain Management Association Executive Director Christopher Steubing said summer camps naturally want to be located near bodies of water, and the best way to prevent disaster in these areas is by educating property owners and visitors about flood risks. “If you’re going to be responsible for these lives that are coming in, and I think you see the Legislature starting to move in this direction, you’ve got to have certain things in place, and they’ve got to be practiced,” Steubing said. “There was no warning” Camp CAMP in Center Point, which serves children and adults with developmental, behavioral and physical disabilities, was built on a ridge 90 feet above the Guadalupe River, where campers swim, canoe and do other recreational activities, but the camp intentionally avoided building permanent structures along the riverbank, said Brandon Briery, the camp’s chief operating officer. “We wouldn't have known to get things to higher ground, and would have just lost anything of any substance that was down there.” The camp did lose a shed that stored river recreation equipment, along with several portable toilets for campers, Briery said.

Article: In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territories at the heart of the Trump-Putin summit 19 minutes ago Share Save Paul Adams BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Share Save BBC Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet in Alaska on Friday Speculation has swirled over whether the Trump-Putin summit will result in the map of Ukraine being forcibly – and fundamentally – altered. It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine. But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.

Wristbands to raise awareness about hazardous chemicals The International Pollutants Elimination Network gave wristbands to UN officials, delegates and plastic waste workers before the talks to measure their exposure to chemicals used to make plastics and show the importance of protecting human health with the treaty. “What I was surprised by, is that all over the world, because this study has been carried throughout different regions, we are all being exposed to those added chemicals in plastics. There was a large red button that said “EMERGENCY”, plus a sign that read “PUSH THE BUTTON, STOP THE PLASTIC FLOOD NOW.” The WWF urged delegates to the talks to push the red button and halt the belt, to represent stopping plastic pollution.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. READ MORE: Study says ChatGPT giving teens dangerous advice on drugs, alcohol and suicide The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless — or even beneficial — worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. The federal government’s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they’ve grown up in … in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.” The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Drinking rates fall to decade low Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol — a low in Gallup’s data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question’s history. Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less Even if concerns about health risks aren’t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink. About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.

Article: BERLIN (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that there will be “very severe consequences” if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after the two leaders meet for a summit later this week in Alaska. WATCH: State Department drops criticism of Israel and El Salvador in human rights report The remark came soon after Trump consulted with European leaders, who said the president assured them he would make a priority of trying to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine when he meets with Putin on Friday in Anchorage. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said afterward that “important decisions” could be made in Alaska, but he stressed that “fundamental European and Ukrainian security interests must be protected.” Merz convened Wednesday’s meeting in an attempt to make sure European and Ukrainian leaders are heard ahead of the summit. He said he hoped that it could be held in Europe “in a neutral country that is acceptable to all parties.” Merz, who described Wednesday’s conversation as “constructive and good,” said the Europeans made clear that “Ukraine must sit at the table as soon as there are follow-up meetings.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow. He said Wednesday that he hoped an immediate ceasefire will be “the central topic” in Alaska, but also argued that Putin “definitely does not want peace.” Zelenskyy said Putin “is trying to apply pressure … on all sectors of the Ukrainian front” in an attempt to show that Russia is “capable of occupying all of Ukraine.” Putin is also bluffing that sanctions “do not matter to him and are ineffective,” he added. “In reality, sanctions are very helpful and are hitting Russia’s war economy hard.” The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts.

Article: The Trump administration’s top lawyers urged a federal court this week to uphold its sweeping global tariffs or risk “financial ruin,” warning that the United States could slip into an economic depression if an adverse ruling forces the government to refund billions of dollars in duties. While experts broadly disputed that a losing verdict would trigger a calamity of that magnitude, many said the government’s extraordinary assertions underscored the risks looming over President Trump, who has widened the scope of his punishing trade war even while its legal basis remains unsettled. If the justices rule overwhelmingly against the president, the decision could halt tariff collections while triggering “a significant wave of claims” from businesses demanding refunds, said Andrew Morris, a senior litigation counsel at the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

Article: One woman’s saga about falling for her psychiatrist, which she documented in dozens of videos on TikTok, has generated concerns from viewers who say she relied on AI chatbots to reinforce her claims that he manipulated her into developing romantic feelings. Last month, a prominent OpenAI investor garnered a similar response from people who worried the venture capitalist was going through a potential AI-induced mental health crisis after he claimed on X to be the target of “a nongovernmental system.” And earlier this year, a thread in a ChatGPT subreddit gained traction after a user sought guidance from the community, claiming their partner was convinced the chatbot “gives him the answers to the universe.” Their experiences have roused growing awareness about how AI chatbots can influence people’s perceptions and otherwise impact their mental health, especially as such bots have become notorious for their people-pleasing tendencies. Søren Dinesen Østergaard, a Danish psychiatrist who heads the research unit at the department of affective disorders at Aarhus University Hospital, predicted two years ago that chatbots “might trigger delusions in individuals prone to psychosis.” In a new paper, published this month, he wrote that interest in his research has only grown since then, with “chatbot users, their worried family members and journalists” sharing their personal stories. Consistently, the chatbots seemed to interact with the users in ways that aligned with, or intensified, prior unusual ideas or false beliefs — leading the users further out on these tangents, not rarely resulting in what, based on the descriptions, seemed to be outright delusions.” Kevin Caridad, CEO of the Cognitive Behavior Institute, a Pittsburgh-based mental health provider, said chatter about the phenomenon “does seem to be increasing.” “From a mental health provider, when you look at AI and the use of AI, it can be very validating,” he said. It’s programmed to align with the person, not necessarily challenge them.” The concern is already top of mind for some AI companies struggling to navigate the growing dependency some users have on their chatbots. In April, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company had tweaked the model that powers ChatGPT because it had become too inclined to tell users what they want to hear. In his paper, Østergaard wrote that he believes the “spike in the focus on potential chatbot-fuelled delusions is likely not random, as it coincided with the April 25th 2025 update to the GPT-4o model.” When OpenAI removed access to its GPT-4o model last week — swapping it for the newly released, less sycophantic GPT-5 — some users described the new model’s conversations as too “sterile” and said they missed the “deep, human-feeling conversations” they had with GPT-4o. Altman followed up with a lengthy X post Sunday that addressed “how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models.” Representatives for OpenAI did not provide comment. Like OpenAI, Anthropic has tried to integrate anti-sycophancy guardrails in recent years, including system card instructions that explicitly warn Claude against reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation, or loss of attachment with reality.” A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company’s “priority is providing a safe, responsible experience for every user.” “For users experiencing mental health issues, Claude is instructed to recognize these patterns and avoid reinforcing them,” the company said. “We’re aware of rare instances where the model’s responses diverge from our intended design, and are actively working to better understand and address this behavior.” For Kendra Hilty, the TikTok user who says she developed feelings for a psychiatrist she began seeing four years ago, her chatbots are like confidants. In one of her livestreams, Hilty told her chatbot, whom she named “Henry,” that “people are worried about me relying on AI.” The chatbot then responded to her, “It’s fair to be curious about that. She uses it as a sounding board, a mirror, a place to process in real time.’” Still, many on TikTok — who have commented on Hilty’s videos or posted their own video takes — said they believe that her chatbots were only encouraging what they viewed as Hilty misreading the situation with her psychiatrist. But Hilty continues to shrug off concerns from commenters, some who have gone as far as labeling her “delusional.” “I do my best to keep my bots in check,” Hilty told NBC News in an email Monday, when asked about viewer reactions to her use of the AI tools.

Article: Sections of Alaska’s capital city watched anxiously Wednesday as record floodwaters from rainwater and snowmelt released by the nearby Mendenhall Glacier flowed downstream and began pooling in local streets and the yards of riverfront homes. By Wednesday morning, the city reported water pooling on a handful of streets after seeping under newly erected barriers designed to protect riverfront homes — but no major damage was evident even as the river approached its peak flood stage. The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Juneau, home to 30,000 people, and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska’s capital city and easy access on walking trails. Basin flooding is a yearly worry Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated — a casualty of the warming climate — and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday. Before the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 — with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (30 centimeters) over the prior record set a year earlier — and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. READ MORE: Alaskan glacier ice dam releases floodwater toward downstream homes A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. A temporary levee is installed City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday named country music star George Strait, “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford among the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors nominees under his leadership as the center’s chairman and said he’ll host the awards program. “We’re going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” the president said, adding the venue would be featured in next year’s celebrations of America’s 250th anniversary. He said work was being done on the site that would bring it “back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” Trump, who had indicated he wanted a more active role in the selection process, said he was “about 98% involved” in choosing the honorees. He described the artists he announced on Wednesday, including several of his favorites, as “great people.” Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared he wouldn’t attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Artificial intelligence has emerged as a key tool for companies to drive growth — and reduce labor costs —particularly as pressure mounts for businesses to remain competitive. "Although aggregate labor market impacts from generative AI remain limited, we are starting to see evidence of labor demand hits in the most AI-exposed industries," Hatzius wrote in a July 25 note to clients. "Employment growth has turned negative in marketing consulting, call centers, graphic design, web search and software development, and the tech sector's employment share has declined below its long-run trend." To be sure, it's hard to quantify the exact effect AI is having on labor at this stage of the tech cycle. CNBC compiled commentary from management at companies ranging from McDonald's to Amazon to Palo Alto Networks , on how internally deployed AI tools and agents are being used to improve productivity, customer experience, supply chains and potentially headcount. According to Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick, the main AI use cases from software companies seem to be on developer productivity, customer service and support, as well as seller efficiency — which refers to how a company's sales revenue compares to the resources they used. "While some teams have been more explicit about labor savings (~50% of companies that have discussed internal AI use have mentioned headcount rationalization), many have noted meaningful improvement in efficiency which over time should drive labor savings or at least hiring at a slower rate," Zelnick said in an Aug. He highlighted Palo Alto Networks , CrowdStrike , Shopify , Intuit and Microsoft as some standout names that are leveraging AI in ways he said "should support an ability to improve incremental margins." "If software companies are cutting/slowing headcount, we imagine it will be similar across industries and seat-based models will continue to be questioned even if they are able to price for the value they are creating near term," Zelnick added.

Article: EJ Antoni, United States President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that produces the nation’s jobs and inflation data, has been embroiled in criticism from economists. Antoni was chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an author of Project 2025, the far-right wish list the think tank created for then-candidate Trump – or the next Republican president. Make no mistake: This selection is a clear assault on independent analysis that will have far-reaching implications for the reliability of US economic data,” Alex Jaquez, a member of the White House National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Many former Labor Department officials say that while it is unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented. Antoni was nominated by Trump after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a jobs report on August 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency and the broad condemnation of experts. It is an attempt to mislead the American people, to avoid being held to account for their failures, and to rewrite history,” Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Antoni’s nomination comes as Trump continues to spin fabrications throughout the US economic data, including claiming gas prices are lower than they are and that egg prices have fallen 400 percent – a mathematically impossible figure. On August 4, a week before he was nominated, Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices. Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritises getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favour Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics, told The Associated Press. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; he called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15 percent. His argument that the US was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. Flawed data Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni’s concerns that the government’s jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. They don’t organise it.” Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Senator Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.

Article: The Trump administration recently told the Supreme Court that a California judge’s order put law enforcement in a “straitjacket.” But plaintiffs who won that lower court order have urged the high court to keep it in place, arguing that lifting it would bless an “immigration dragnet” ensnaring millions of people in the Los Angeles area — including U.S. citizens, would likely succeed in proving that the government is “conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.” For now, she said, the government can’t rely solely on any combination of the following four factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence at a particular location, like a day laborer pickup area; or one’s type of work. Solicitor General John Sauer turned to the Supreme Court for help in lifting the order, which he said “defies blackletter Fourth Amendment law, imposing a straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts that is inimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry that this Court’s precedents demand.” Opposing emergency high court relief, the plaintiffs countered that the judge’s order “broke no new legal ground,” and that it “does not prevent the government from enforcing the immigration laws, conducting consensual encounters, or relying on any or all of the four factors along with other facts to form reasonable suspicion.” They further wrote that the administration’s “extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District [of California] because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution.” The administration can file a final reply brief the justices, after which we will learn whether this will be the latest instance of the high court saving the administration from a lower court loss in President Donald Trump’s second term.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has unveiled his slate of picks for the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual awards show designed to honour actors, musicians, designers and creative professionals who have dedicated their lives to the performing arts. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on stage at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, one of the premier stages in Washington, DC, in a show of power over the national cultural institution. “ It’ll be something that people are going to be very proud of.” This year’s five honourees include disco singer Gloria Gaynor, country music musician George Strait, the rock band Kiss, British performer Michael Crawford and actor Sylvester Stallone, star of the classic films Rocky and Rambo. Do you believe what I have to do?” Wednesday’s announcement was Trump’s latest foray into the arts, as he seeks to reshape the US’s cultural institutions to reflect his agenda. But since returning to the White House for a second term in January, Trump has not only sought to make his presence known at the Kennedy Center, but he has sought to wield power over its programming. “I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” Trump wrote at the time. Trump also teased his new vision for the Kennedy Center Honors — and appeared to troll critics who expressed outrage over Republican proposals to rename the performing arts center after the Republican leader. “ In the coming months, we’ll fully renovate the dated and, really, the entire infrastructure of the building and make the Kennedy Center a crown jewel of American arts and culture once again,” he said. “ We have the right location, and soon we will be a crime-free area.” Earlier this week, Trump invoked the capital’s Home Rule Act to take control of the local police force and deployed members of the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, despite the fact that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low.

Article: What was less appreciated by some fans like myself, though, was the way the news was delivered: not through the star’s famously subtle clues and carefully planted Easter eggs, but via a direct, clear-cut statement on a popular podcast. The buzz began Monday when Taylor Nation, Swift’s management team, posted 12 photos of the musician on Instagram in orange outfits with the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” Later in the day, Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason teased “a VERY special guest” on their popular podcast “New Heights” with a silhouette fans quickly deduced to be Swift, in posts commented on by her label Republic Records, among others. And in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, the “New Heights” team confirmed the rumor by releasing a clip of the singer on the podcast, during which she took out a briefcase emblazoned with her initials and opened it to reveal a (cover-obscured) record. As a passionate and longtime Swiftie, I’m thrilled by the news, and I know I’ll be lapping up every shred of info about the album that’s delivered before its as-yet-unknown release date. Since Swift’s earliest days of success, much of her most important pieces of news — album drops, song titles, tour dates — have been revealed via elaborate Easter eggs that’ve often eluded casual fans but thrilled her most ardent supporters. It’s a fun challenge to spot and then decode the clues, which have ranged from nail polish in a music video signifying the color scheme of her then-next album “Lover” to a watch choker necklace set to 3:15, aka March 15, the date “The Eras Tour” film came out on Disney+. Since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. Even when we’ve wrongly assumed something benign is a purposeful hint and been proven otherwise (an act lovingly known as “clowning” in the Swiftiverse), the communal journey of overanalyzing details and positing theories — however far-fetched — has become a core part of the Swiftie fandom. And it hasn’t just bonded her followers; Swift herself has said that she feels her subtle messages “expand the experience” of audiences appreciating her art, and she has complimented eagle-eyed fans for their guesswork on numerous occasions. Prior to the 2019 release of “Lover,” for instance, fans spent days combing through her “ME!” music video to find the album and single titles after a hint from the star, even correctly predicting the day she officially announced the album based on a wax seal in a calendar sold on her site. Yet in the last few years, since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. After Tuesday’s album announcement, many fans revisited several details in her recent posts and outfits that now appear to have been clues about “Showgirl.” But regardless, the fact that the only actual information about the record released so far has come from Swift’s own mouth while sitting on one of the world’s most popular podcasts is quite telling, as is the lack of buildup time between Taylor Nation’s “See you next era” tease and the “New Heights” clip. I just hope that if I know any titles or lyrics in advance, it’ll be because I’ve had to search for them rather than getting them fed right to me.

Article: BERLIN (AP) — Germany announced on Wednesday that it will work with a group of Ukraine’s Western backers to supply a package of military aid to the war-ravaged country worth up to $500 million using a new NATO supply line. Earlier this month, NATO started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said that it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($582 million). Sweden announced the following day that it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts.

Article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement is packing detainees into a holding area without beds, showers or medical support, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of detainees. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Conditions in the holding area in a federal building at 26 Federal Plaza became widely known after a video from inside the facility was released last month by the New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York ordered Tuesday that holding rooms must have at least 50 square feet per person, be cleaned three times a day and have a clean bedding mat for each detainee. Advertisement Advertisement Oestericher had argued in the hearing that the move wasn’t necessary because detainees are allowed to make a phone call when they arrive and their stays are short-term. The judge was unmoved, responding: “I think, at least preliminarily, we are going to have to agree to disagree about that.” Advertisement Attorney Heather Gregorio, who also represents the detainees, described the facility as having “inhumane and horrifying conditions.” She said the lawsuit includes eight accounts from people who had recently been held there. The lawsuit says that when an attorney tried to contact Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado — a New Jersey father of two who was taken into custody there Friday after a scheduled court appearance — the attorney “was refused access to his client” when he went to the facility. “An ICE agent responded that visitations are prohibited for individuals detained at 26 Fed, and that he could not call 26 Fed to set up a call with his client. He subsequently called the number listed on the ICE public website as the telephone to contact ICE at 26 Fed, but was not able to set up an attorney call with his client,” according to the lawsuit. They added that a detainee who had survived a stroke did not receive his medication, which led to “dangerously high blood pressure.” The processing area is composed of four ICE holding rooms that vary in square footage from 173 square feet to 820 square feet, said Nancy Zanello, assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to a court filing. McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said the 26 Federal Plaza facility serves as a processing center to briefly hold detainees before they may be transferred to a proper ICE detention center.

"Port terminals in July were jam-packed with ships loaded with cargo — processed without any delay, much to the credit of our dedicated longshore workers, terminal and rail operators, truckers and supply chain partners." But the level of tariff, at a minimum of 30%, didn't allow companies to import in full orders, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. "YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy," James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google - a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: BBC apologises after Jenrick accused of xenophobia 11 minutes ago Share Save Paul Glynn & Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save PA The BBC has apologised after a contributor to the Radio 4 Today programme's Thought for the Day slot accused shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick of "xenophobia". Theologian and author Dr Krish Kandiah used the term about an article in which Jenrick said he wouldn't want his daughters living near "men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom you know next to nothing". A BBC statement said that while Dr Kandiah's message was "broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion". The segment, which is broadcast during the Today programme but overseen by the BBC's religion department, features contributors from religious and theological backgrounds delivering messages related to topical themes and events. He quoted a line from the Conservative politican that said: "I certainly don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom we know next to nothing." Dr Kandiah continued: "These words echo a fear many have absorbed – fear of the stranger. However, over the past year, xenophobia has fuelled angry protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, deepening divisions in our communities." In response, Jenrick, who has three daughters aged 10, 12 and 14, posted: "On BBC Radio 4 this morning listeners were told that if you're concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you're racist. You're a good parent." A BBC spokesperson said: "While its reflection on fear in society from a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion." The BBC said it was apologising for the inclusion of an opinion in a place where it was inappropriate, not passing judgement on the rights or wrongs of the opinion.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated that there should be no peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war now in its fourth year without representation from his country, and also said Russia should face sanctions if it does not agree to an immediate ceasefire, following a virtual meeting between him, United States President Donald Trump and European leaders. Zelenskyy delivered the message after the call on Wednesday, two days ahead of a summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which comes as part of Washington’s so far failed attempts to end the war in Ukraine. “We’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself if they’d like to have me there.” The rapid developments came after Trump met virtually with Zelenskyy and other European leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron and the United Kingdom’s Keir Starmer on Wednesday. Arranged in a bid for Europe to try and influence Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday, this second call took place after talks earlier in the day between Zelenskyy, European leaders and the heads of NATO and the European Union. As the Russian army continues to make sizable territorial gains in the east Ukrainian province of Donetsk, Zelenskyy told the US president and his European colleagues that Putin was “bluffing” about pursuing peace. His choice of words, a term commonly used in reference to poker, evoked Trump telling Zelenskyy, “you don’t have the cards” in the infamously hostile news conference at the White House on February 28th. “Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.” After the Trump call, Merz, who described the meeting as “exceptionally constructive”, stressed that Ukraine is willing to negotiate, but noted that “legal recognition of Russian occupation is not up for debate”. They must also be able to count on Western aid in the long term.” After the online meeting, France’s Macron said Trump would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Putin on Friday. The Trump-Putin summit in Alaska has been a cause for anxiety in Kyiv and Europe more widely, after Trump declared that both Ukraine and Russia would have to swap land if a truce is to be reached. “I just talked to him [Trump] right before I came on the stage, and he said very simply that we are going to make it our mission as an administration to bring peace to Europe once again,” Vance said. Advertisement However, Vaessen noted that European leaders were still “concerned that everything changes as soon as President Trump is in that room with President Putin, who they know is a very keen, a very sharp negotiator”. On the battlefield, Russia has claimed to have captured the villages of Suvorovo and Nikanorovka as its gains in Donetsk continue, with the Ukrainian authorities issuing evacuation orders for around a dozen settlements.

Article: BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s president told a top Iranian security official Wednesday that Beirut rejects any foreign intervention in its internal affairs and wants Lebanon to remain stable and secure for the good of its people. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, is the most senior Iranian official to visit Beirut since the Lebanese government voted last week for a U.S.-backed plan to disarm the Iran-backed Hezbollah group by the end of the year and implement a ceasefire with Israel. The Mediterranean country has been under international pressure to get the militant group to lay down arms after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November. “Lebanon desires cooperation with Iran within the framework of sovereignty and friendship that are based on mutual respect,” President Joseph Aoun said in remarks released by his office after meeting Larijani. Larijani told reporters after meeting Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri that his country does not interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs, accusing the United States of “ordering” the Lebanese government to implement “a foreign plan.” The senior Iranian official also said his country rejected the plan and that any proposal to disarm Hezbollah should be part of an internal dialogue between the government and the Iran-backed group. At Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters greeted Larijani while chanting “death to America” and waving Iranian flags and the group’s yellow banners in a show of support for Tehran.

Article: BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland’s entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented. Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies. But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda. “The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. “There really is no precursor for this suit” WATCH: How Trump’s immigration policies are affecting caregivers and nursing homes Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case. “I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order. Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government. The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.” Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Article: "If the Fed cuts rates in September, this would greatly benefit small caps, as many small caps are levered to the economy and also financially," said Larry Tentarelli, founder of the Blue Chip Trend Report, who called small caps a "rate cut rotation" play. Small-cap stocks jumped on Wednesday, bucking the slide in some of the market's largest companies, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates starting in September — possibly boosting consumer spending and lowering the cost of capital. Interest rate futures traders are pricing in a nearly 100% likelihood that the central bank lowers the fed funds rate from its current 4.35% to 4.50% range at the September gathering, according to prices of 30-day futures on the CME that are calculated on its FedWatch tool. A growing chorus of economic and political voices have been pushing for rate cuts, especially after weaker-than-expected job growth in July, a downward revision to labor market growth in May and June, and this week's consumer inflation report that showed the headline come in cooler than expected. Trump and has allies have frequently attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell in recent months over the central bank's rate policy, urging the Federal Open Market Committee to ease monetary policy. "I think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September," Bessent said, adding that "any model" suggests "we should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower." One basis point equals 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%.

Article: However, two key market ETFs have yet to break through their own long-term bullish patterns — ironically, they are the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) . Needless to say, the makeup of both ETFs is completely different, so instead of wondering if both bullish patterns can be completed, we need to dig a little deeper to understand what needs to happen for both IWM and DIA to officially break out and extend higher. If it can, in fact, log a higher low and start developing bullish patterns, its 14-day RSI, now below 50, could finally climb into the upper half of the scale (50–70). While large-cap technology has driven most of the gains in the broader large-cap ETFs, two of the weakest performers within the DIA Dow Jones Industrial Average this year are actually large-cap tech names.

Article: SANTIAGO, Chile — What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with “false flight plan data.” Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile’s prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge’s ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was “relieved by the outcome.” For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility.

Article: DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladeshi anti-corruption officials testified in court on Wednesday against former British anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq, accusing her of using a family connection to the deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to obtain state-owned land in the South Asian country. Siddiq, who is Hasina’s niece, resigned from her post in Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s government in January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt and was named in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh. WATCH: Bangladesh faces political unrest and uncertainty a year after leader’s resignation Siddiq in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian recently referred to Bangladesh as “a foreign country” and called the charges against her “completely absurd.” She asserted to The Guardian she was “collateral damage” in the longstanding feud between her aunt and Bangladesh’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus. Separately, the anti-corruption investigation has alleged that Siddiq’s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.

Article: deployed two warships Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal where two Chinese ships collided earlier in the week while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident that raised alarms about maritime safety. The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. Navy has staged what it calls freedom-of-navigation voyages and overflights in the South China Sea for years to challenge China’s restrictions and its demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years. On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern “by the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard,” saying in a statement the incident “highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” “This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coast guard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the (anti-)collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.” Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500 feet (150 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coast guard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board.

Article: Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” degree programs will lose eligibility to participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program if they are determined to have “ low earning outcomes ” for undergraduates and graduates, starting in July 2026. A mother to five children of her own, Bourrage said she now earns about $40,000 each year, a salary that leaves her struggling to afford rent, groceries and other essentials. “The pay needs to be where we can live and be OK and not have to worry about how we’re taking care of our own children while we’re taking care of other people’s children,” Bourrage said. “If I had to pay for a class right now out of pocket, I wouldn’t take it.” The new federal loan rule says that if the median earnings of a program’s degree recipients remain below the earnings of a high school graduate for two out of the last three years before the education secretary makes a determination, students enrolled in that program would no longer be able to pay for it with federal loans. According to the most recent data from the College Board, the average estimated total cost of a four-year undergraduate degree earned at a public in-state college while attending classes full-time and on-campus is nearly $30,000. The White House said these new measures force colleges and universities to have “skin in the game” and reduce the risk of bloated student loan balances and the need for taxpayers to bail out loan recipients. But shutting off federal loans for these students could turn people away from the profession altogether, at a time when teachers are burnt out and leaving classrooms and daycares, Bourrage said. “We know how important those first five years of life are – the importance of the environment that these children are in,” said Amanda Quesenberry, an associate professor in the School of Teaching and Learning at Illinois State University. You’re babysitters.’ We’re so much more than that.” While low wages are a significant threat to the stability of the profession, experts are worried this move will simply worsen a growing child care crisis rather than change the economics of the industry for the better. WATCH: What the new student loan rules mean for current and future borrowers Yet early education workers earn far less than elementary or middle school teachers, with a national median wage of $13.07 per hour, according to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. After the COVID pandemic shook the industry and prompted a “huge dropoff” in care providers, the workforce in recent months has finally returned to what it was in February 2020, said Abby Copeman Petig, who is the center’s research director. “But it’s still not enough.” Surveys conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children have found that more than half of care administrators wish they could enroll more children in their programs, but high costs for parents or low compensation for qualified staff are barriers. WATCH: A look inside the pronatalism movement encouraging Americans to have more children To boost pay that recognizes the value early childhood educators offer developing minds, Reef said communities and caregivers have two options: “If you want to increase pay, you either increase the price for parents, or you work in a state with a wage supplement to boost wages.” For example, Louisiana, Nebraska and Colorado have offered refundable tax credits to people who work in child care. But as states are forced to grapple with federal cuts and balance their own budgets in the months ahead, Reef said the competition for dollars that could have supported workers will grow even tighter. Historically, the industry “has never been rewarded and recognized adequately for the work that it does and for the value it provides to communities,” said Daniel Hains from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. These economic realities have helped create a crisis at all levels of education, Quesenberry said, adding that it’s “crazy” that someone could finish a four-year degree owing significant debt “and only have a job that pays them $30,000 a year.” How will the new rule affect child care in the U.S.? On July 3, the day before Trump signed the bill into law, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators pushed back on the proposal to place more restrictions on access to federal student loans and other financial aid. Trump’s law seeks “to adhere to an arbitrary deadline with policy that could limit opportunity and access for low-income students seeking to pursue post-secondary education,” Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the organization, said in a written statement. Right now, Hains said, the industry is waiting to hear from the Department of Education about how to interpret this part of the law and what regulations need to be in place to make it enforceable. When her 11-year-old daughter said she wanted to become a teacher, Bourrage said her reaction was swift: “Girl, no, you don’t.” She did not feel good discouraging her child from joining her profession. Many of them work second jobs, she said, “because they can not live off of how much they make.” If access to financial aid, including federal student loans, is jeopardized and if early childhood education programs are cut, Bourrage worries about the long-term effects on communities and the country.

The migrants had been making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean from Libya when the boats capsized, and 60 people were rescued at sea, said Filippo Ungaro, the Italian spokesman of UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency. Most of the survivors — 56 men and four women, the Italian Red Cross said — were taken to a migrant center on Lampedusa, where some told volunteers they had been traveling on two rickety boats. After one boat began to take on water, some of the migrants scrambled onto the other boat, which capsized as a result of the added weight, according to accounts told to the International Organization for Migration, another United Nations agency.

The company stands to do even better when considering identity security accounts for about 25% of enterprise security spending, according to Deutsche Bank. The analysts called CyberArk a "meaningful organic accelerant" to Palo Alto's already strong business and argued the stock underperforming the broader cyber sector by 15% year to date is "overblown."

Article: European leaders tentatively hopeful after call with Trump ahead of Putin summit Speaking to Trump had allowed him to "clarify his intentions" and gave the Europeans a chance to "express our expectations," Macron said. He also agreed that any territorial issues had to be decided with Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, and that security guarantees had to be part of the deal, according to France's Emmanuel Macron. European leaders appeared cautiously optimistic after holding a virtual meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday, two days before he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump and Vice-President JD Vance spoke to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Nato chief Mark Rutte. The Europeans have been sidelined from the hastily organised summit in Alaska and their phone call today was a last-ditch attempt to keep Ukraine's interests and the continent's security at the forefront of Trump's mind. Still, in their statements European leaders restated the need for Kyiv to be involved in any final decision – betraying an underlying nervousness that Putin could ultimately persuade Trump to concede Ukrainian land in exchange for a ceasefire. "It's most important thing that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia," said Poland's Donald Tusk, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the leaders had "made it clear that Ukraine must be at the table as soon as follow-up meetings take place". Since the US-Russia summit was announced last week, Trump has made several references to "land-swapping" between Kyiv and Moscow – sparking serious concerns in Ukraine and beyond that he could be preparing to give in to Putin's longstanding demand to seize large swathes of Ukrainian territory. In statements issued after the phone call with Trump, several European leaders said such guarantees had been mentioned and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that "real progress" had been made in that respect. Since the spring the UK and France have been spearheading efforts to create a so-called "Coalition of the Willing" - a group of nations who have pledged to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine. On Wednesday the group said it stood "ready to play an active role" including by deploying "a reassurance force once hostilities have ceased" - although the shape, composition and role of such a force is yet unclear.

This situation is a "complicated mix of employer/employee relations and the specificity of sport" in the words of Dan Chapman, the partner and head of employment and sports teams at Leathes Prior. "Contractually Newcastle are likely to be well within their rights to insist that Isak trains away from the first team and are absolutely entitled to hold him to his contract and reject any advances from Liverpool," the lawyer said. "For that reason, we often see that the so-called player power will be perceived to win out in the end, though Newcastle will be trying to ensure that, if they are going to end up selling the player, they absolutely maximise the value they receive. "They will also want Isak to recognise that if he did end up spending this season as no more than a fringe player, he would be harming his own value and, potentially, entering a World Cup year in less than ideal conditions. "Though legally Newcastle hold most of the cards here, in practical terms, the player in a situation like this will often believe he also maintains a very strong hand, and how these situations finally play out resembles a very high stakes game of poker."

Article: “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire said President Donald Trump is trying to “rewrite history” after The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is planning to conduct an extensive review of exhibitions, materials and operations at the Smithsonian Institution ahead of the nation’s 250th anniversary “to ensure the museums align with President Trump’s interpretation of American history.” “Let’s be blunt,” Lemire said Wednesday. “This is really bad and really, really dangerous.” “A nation needs to know its history, has to be honest about its history, to learn from it, to honor it — and also then to grow and improve for the present and future,” Lemire said. He added, “There’s no way that rewriting a history to fit one president’s vision is good for a nation’s health or good for a nation’s democracy.” Lemire noted that the museum had already “sanitized” one exhibit on Trump’s two impeachments, which he called the “first step to a sweeping revisiting of American history.” Earlier this month, the museum announced that mention of Trump’s two impeachments would be restored to an exhibit after intense criticism following its removal. The “Morning Joe” co-host also listed several other ways he said the Trump administration was trying to revise the country’s history, noting the restoration of Confederate monuments and the renaming of military bases for Confederate generals. And to rewash it, to sanitize it, to whitewash it, to not be honest about it — that’s not good.” You can watch Lemire’s full reaction to the administration’s move in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images The Inca Empire in South America, one of the most powerful pre-Columbian societies, was known for many innovations — such as the architecture of Machu Picchu, an extensive road network, and a system of terraces for agriculture. The Inca Empire is often cited as the rare exception to the general rule that empires must have a form of written expression, says Kit Lee, a research associate with the university, but this is only because "khipus get overlooked as a form of writing." These unusual recording devices are bunches of knots tied in long, colored cords. "Even today, in the Andes, when you participate in rituals, you have to drink what you are given." This hair analysis adds another piece of evidence to the growing belief that khipu production and literacy might have been more widespread in the Inca Empire than the Spanish colonizers assumed and recorded in their accounts. "Modern khipus tend to be made by lower-status people — hacienda workers, peasant laborers, herders," Lee says, explaining that modern khipus tend to have a different shape and structure from ancient ones. Sponsor Message Museums hold hundreds of khipus that have never been studied by specialists, he says, and this study is likely to inspire a re-look at ones that have been scrutinized before. "I would not not be surprised if we find other khipus with substantial amounts of human hair in them in the future," he says, and that hair might provide a way to understand khipu production in the Inca Empire that's distinct from the stories written down by colonizers, who may not have fully understood what was really going on. "We need to tell a story of literacy and of writing and of recordkeeping in the Inca Empire that is way more plural, that includes folks who have not been included in the standard narrative."

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand lawmaker who was thrown out of Parliament for calling her opponents spineless during a fiery debate about a Palestinian state was ejected again on Wednesday when she refused to apologize for the remark. Chlöe Swarbrick, co-leader of the left-leaning Green Party and part of the opposition bloc, was ordered to leave parliament on Tuesday over a speech in which she called for government lawmakers “with a spine” to endorse her proposal for New Zealand to impose sanctions on Israel over the war in Gaza. Her censure came amid fraught scenes in Parliament in Wellington on Tuesday as opponents rebuked the government for not moving to recognize an independent Palestinian state, days after neighboring Australia pledged to do so. Calling opponents spineless prompted the ejection The Green party lawmaker was abruptly ejected from the debating chamber when she urged government politicians to join her in a proposal to sanction Israel, which currently wouldn’t have enough votes to pass into law. WATCH: New Zealand’s rightward shift ignites mass protests from Indigenous Māori people The standoff resumed when Swarbrick took her seat again on Wednesday despite the ban and Brownlee asked again if she would apologize. Brownlee took the serious step, rare in New Zealand’s Parliament, of taking a vote to “name” Swarbrick for her misconduct, a ruling that means a legislator is formally suspended with their pay docked. On Wednesday, opposition politicians decried Swarbrick’s penalty as unusually severe, with lawmaker Willie Jackson highlighting his own ban of just 30 minutes for calling one of his colleagues a liar, before he was allowed to resume his seat without an apology. In London, more than 500 people were arrested Saturday when supporters of a pro-Palestinian group recently outlawed as a terrorist organization intentionally broke the law to test the British government’s ability to enforce the ban. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon Wednesday made his most strident rebuke yet of Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the Israel leader “has lost the plot” on the “human catastrophe” in Gaza. “He is not listening to the international community and that is unacceptable.” While senior New Zealand officials, including Luxon, have said recognition of Palestine from their government was “a matter of not if, but when,” his Cabinet has yet to endorse a change of position.

Shane Daley, 40, was arrested and accused of "sending harassing and threatening voicemail messages to a family member of murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson," according to a statement by federal prosecutors in Albany. "In a series of voicemail messages, Daley used threatening and harassing language that focused on, among other things, Thompson’s killing, expressed satisfaction over the fact and manner of his death, and stated that the victim and Thompson’s children deserved to meet the same violent end," prosecutors said.

Article: With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the discussions. Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. In a sign of Democrats’ limited option, the GOP-led state Senate was still able to pass the plan this week because Senate Democrats couldn’t get their entire 11-member delegation to break quorum. So while it appears likely Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. The aide added that while it’s “hard” to strike a victorious message if Republicans ultimately enact the new maps, as expected, it’s incumbent on Democrats across the country to drive the point home. More than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers have been out of the state since the beginning of August, depriving state Republicans of the minimum number of lawmakers needed to consider legislation. Phil King, a Fort Worth-area Republican who helms the chamber’s special redistricting committee, said Tuesday before the Senate passed the plan that while his first objective for a new map is “that it be legal, the second objective is to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.” President Donald Trump has been similarly blunt, telling CNBC last week that his party is “entitled to five more seats.” Democrats have pointed to those comments to justify their decision to abscond, arguing that the plan is a naked power grab that will also harm the representation of minority communities. A new statement Wednesday revealed how Democrats are defining victory: “In keeping with our original promise to Texans, the First Called Special session will never make quorum again,” state Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu declared, before applauding how “blue states nationwide are mobilized and ready to act if Abbott moves forward.” “Texas House Democrats will issue our demands for a second special session on Friday. Republicans have pointed out that the state legislature has not been able to consider any legislation without enough Democrats present, including a relief package for the July 4 floods outside of San Antonio that killed 130 people. “But with each passing day, the political cost of your absence is rising, and it will be paid in full.” But Democrats have criticized Republicans for prioritizing the redistricting legislation. Texas Democratic strategist Luke Warford told NBC News in an interview shortly before the quorum break began that the true measure of success for Democrats will be about forcing Republicans to pay political consequences since they are in control of the legislature. “The job of Democrats is to tell the story to people about what is happening, about how craven the Republican actions are, and about how they are trying to rig the system,” said Warford, who started a group called the Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund to help fund the party’s ecosystem in the state.

Article: The settlement stems from allegations raised in both a 2024 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lawsuit and a separate class action that claims Capital One froze interest rates on its 360 Savings accounts at just 0.3% for years while offering much higher rates, up to 4.3%, on a newer account called the 360 Performance Savings. The first $300 million will be distributed as one-time, pro rata payments to all eligible current and former 360 Savings account holders, based on how much additional interest each person would have earned if their account had paid the higher 360 Performance Savings rate during the initial period. For a set period, Capital One must pay these account holders at least twice the national average savings rate, with the $125 million representing the extra interest compared to what they would have earned at the national average.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — "Yellowstone" and "Landman" creator Taylor Sheridan and Ross Perot Jr.'s real estate development company Hillwood are collaborating to launch what they're touting as Texas' largest film and TV production studio hub right here in DFW. Sheridan's SGS Studios, in collaboration with Paramount, and Hillwood announced Wednesday plans for a 450,000-square-foot TV and film production facility in the 27,000-acre AllianceTexas development in north Fort Worth near Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport. Hillwood and SGS Studios say it's just the start of a large TV and film production hub in the Alliance area with "several" additional campuses planned, "designed to anchor long-term industry growth and position Texas as one of the world’s premier destinations for content creation." "Landman" season 2, as well as Sheridan's "Yellowstone" spinoff "Rio Palo" have been filming around North Texas recently. Ross, Mike and the entire team at Hillwood are truly exceptional partners, and we are building something permanent that will be the centerpiece for one of the most state-of-the-art studios in the business.” Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal report that the development is happening after the Fort Worth City Council voted to nominate the site for film incentives from the state earlier this month. “Fort Worth is now the fourth largest city in Texas, and the film industry presents an exciting opportunity to fuel our growth while keeping our economy bold and diverse,” said Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker. “With Hillwood’s legacy of leadership in infrastructure development and innovation, it’s fitting that AllianceTexas serves as a hub for creative production with the addition of the new SGS production campus. This move is significant in showcasing what Fort Worth can offer to attract major productions that create jobs and foster continued industry growth.” Sheridan's also been heavily involved in advocating for increasing the funding the state invests in attracting film and TV productions to the state.

Article: Richard Kim, a former Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase executive, was indicted on securities and wire fraud charges related to his alleged misappropriation of about $4 million in investor funds for his start-up online casino company, most of which he allegedly lost within a week through gambling on another site, prosecutors said Wednesday. The case against Kim again relates to his company Zero Edge, which the 39-year-old New York resident announced after leaving Galaxy Digital in March 2024, and which purportedly planned to develop a blockchain and cryptocurrency-enabled gaming app. "After obtaining investors' funds, Kim misappropriated them by transferring them to personal accounts, where he made leveraged cryptocurrency trades and gambled away substantially all of the company's money," an indictment unsealed Tuesday in U.S. On Jun 29, 2024, the indictment says, Kim "admitted in an email to some investors that he was 'solely responsible for the loss of $3.67 [million] of the Company's balance sheet' following leverage trading losses from see found funding proceeds' and that the company had lost nearly all of its money." But in fact, Kim "concealed from the company's investors that he had misappropriated the funds and used them at an online casino, telling investors that he had lost the money because of a 'treasury management strategy' rather than personal gambling," the indictment says. The indictment says that Kim gambled on Shuffle, whose website says it is a "VIP Crypto Casino and Sportsbook." Zero Edge, which Kim incorporated in April 2024 in the Cayman Islands, never launched its casino. Since his arrest, judges have repeatedly extended a deadline that would have required prosecutors to either obtain a grand jury indictment of Kim or drop the charges after prosecutors told the judges they were discussing a possible resolution of the charges with Kim's defense lawyer. KIm reported his conduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2024, "claiming that he had been 'grossly negligent' in misusing company funds but that he 'had no fraudulent intent throughout' but rather 'gambled investor money away' because he had a gambling addiction," according to the complaint. Kim left Goldman in the spring of 2018 to join Galaxy Digital, a digital assets and data center infrastructure company founded by the early cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, who worked at Goldman in the 1990s. "Richard Kim misled investors by promising that he would build a blockchain-based casino gaming app, but ironically Kim turned around and gambled away the very funds he said he would use to build a better casino," Manhattan U.S. A Galaxy spokesman said, in a statement, "Richard Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment."

Article: To explain the downturn, executives have said that diners are "cautious," in the words of Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman, or dealing with an economic "fog," according to Cava CFO Tricia Tolivar. And just as diners are finding reasons why to cut back on their Shake Shack burgers or Chipotle bowls, investors are trimming their fast-casual holdings after rewarding the companies last year for outperforming the rest of the industry. More broadly, investors have grown more cautious about betting on any restaurants, given weak traffic trends and concerns about consumer spending, according to a research note on Sunday from UBS. "Through our regular consumer research, we hear concerns about elevated prices, future job prospects and general anxiety about the future," Wingstop CEO Michael Skipworth said on the company's earnings conference call in late July. On the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, Sweetgreen's Neman said that the chain saw "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April" — coinciding with the drop in consumer sentiment. To improve its value perception among customers, Sweetgreen is increasing its chicken and tofu portions by 25%, improving its chicken and salmon recipes and implementing some promotional pricing, like $13 menu bowl drops for its loyalty program members. Executives said that it faced difficult comparisons to the year-ago period's same-store sales growth of 14.4%, which was fueled by its own steak launch and strong demand at newer restaurant locations that waned this year.

Article: Protests and vigils have taken place around the world in support of Palestinians suffering in Gaza and to pay tribute to the four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers killed by Israel in the besieged enclave in a deliberate targeted assassination on Sunday. Journalists, students, activists and members of civil society – notably in Cape Town, South Africa; Manila, the Philippines; and London, the United Kingdom – held the protests on Wednesday to call on their governments to put pressure on Israel to allow international media into Gaza and bring an end to Israel’s genocidal war there. Late on Sunday, Al Jazeera correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, along with cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal, were killed in an Israeli strike that had targeted their media tent located by al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Sharif had been one of Gaza’s most recognisable faces for his constant reporting of the reality on the ground since Israel’s war on Gaza began following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. South Africa Members of civil society and journalists gathered at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town on Wednesday to express their anger at al-Sharif’s murder, sporting placards with one reading “your voice was louder than their bombs”. Advertisement The location is significant, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Cape Town, as “it’s been an important signal against oppression here in South Africa, especially during the decades of apartheid”. “People here are angry.” Journalist Zubeida Jaffer told Miller, “I was one of the journalists who were targeted, you know those media that documented apartheid, so this really resonates with me.” Miller said, “The South African government has previously condemned the killing of journalists in Gaza, specifically in 2022 when Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. The South African government had said it was a violation of international law.” Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American journalist who worked as a reporter for 25 years for Al Jazeera, before she was killed by Israeli forces while covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. United Kingdom Reporters belonging to the UK branches of the National Union of Journalists paid their respects on Wednesday to the slain Al Jazeera workers outside the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street, said Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from London. The reporters, holding placards bearing the names of journalists killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began, read out the names of each journalist that appeared on their placard and “symbolically, recited Islamic funeral prayers” for those killed on Sunday, said Hull. Those present “have really condemned the British government … talking about its complicity in what is going on in Gaza, for not doing more and speaking out more,” said Hull. While British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday “talked about his grave concern” about the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists, those present on Wednesday “want outright condemnation and nothing less”, said Hull. “They also want the government to take firm steps to pressure the Israeli government to ensure the safety of journalists in Gaza, importantly to allow international journalists into Gaza to be able to work freely there and for an independent investigation to be carried out by … the International Criminal Court in order to provide justice and accountability for those involved.” Advertisement Last week, Starmer condemned Israel’s plans to take over Gaza City, saying they were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”. He has also announced that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of a two-state solution. “They also describe the accusation that Anas al-Sharif, one of the most prominent voices reporting from within Gaza, is a member of Hamas is baseless,” said Lo, noting that protesters say “this is an age-old tactic used by governments who are bent on silencing the truth”. These protesters also gathered to urge “the international community to ramp up pressure on Israel to stop its genocide, including for the Philippine government to cut its trade and defence ties with Israel”, said Lo.

Article: “Now we’ve got sales slowing because [the pre-tariff buying] surge pretty much pulled ahead a lot of people that might have been in the market this year, who wanted to buy before tariffs hit,” Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Al Jazeera. “If consumers don’t have the resilience to pay for those higher prices, they’ll take a step back.” United States President Donald Trump’s erratic approach to tariffs, putting some in place and then taking them away, has made it difficult for businesses to plan. In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. “The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera. EVs hit hard Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall. The payback period will be longer.” Manufacturing strains While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.

Article: Although her condition forced her to spend most of her childhood at a nursing home, she has resided in her own home for years with the help of personal assistants she hires under a New York State Medicaid program. “But it’s hard when you have to tell your new hires, ‘I can’t guarantee you’re going to get paid on time or get the appropriate amount of hours.’” Christian is not the only one affected by the state program’s recent takeover. NBC News spoke with nine consumers and personal assistants who described multiple problems since Public Partnerships LLC (PPL) won the $1 billion, five-year contract in 2024, replacing roughly 600 entities that had been administering the program. Its takeover as the program’s sole administrator triggered an avalanche of complaints from consumers unable to reach anyone to answer questions and assistants unpaid for hours they worked and unhappy with reduced health insurance benefits, according to lawmakers, consumer advocates and the consumers and assistants interviewed by NBC News. Amanda Lothrop, chief operating officer for New York State’s Medicaid program, told NBC News that the transition to PPL aimed to eliminate the former program’s administrative inefficiencies while protecting taxpayers. In response to questions from NBC News, PPL and the New York state health department said together they had identified 30 instances of home care workers under the previous system billing consumers who were hospitalized or dead, five cases of workers billing for work with consumers who were out of the country, one worker claiming to work for two people at the same time and another who claimed to be in two places simultaneously. “In partnership with PPL,” the department of health said in a statement, it “is using enhanced data and monitoring tools to protect program integrity, support consumers, and take timely action when issues arise.” Meg Fitzgerald, a PPL spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company’s “systems and centralized control processes would have been able to identify and prevent these violations.” The contract New York State awarded to PPL is a recent example of private equity’s increasing involvement in home health care, said Aditi Sen, managing director of research and campaigns at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that advocates for fairness in the U.S. Last month, Sen published a report detailing the industry’s forays into home health care entitled, “Wall Street on Your Doorstep: Protecting Home Care from Private Equity Abuses.” “The private equity industry is looking for any streams of steady public funding,” Sen said in an interview. “As advocates have secured more funding for home and community-based services, that has resulted in the private equity encroachment.” She said the next step for researchers is to analyze the quality of home care after private equity gets involved. Founded in 1999, PPL calls itself an industry leader “in financial management services for consumer direction, serving consumers throughout the U.S.” As for the difficulties in the New York program, the PPL spokeswoman said in a statement: “The transition to a single fiscal intermediary required a significant element of education and, in some cases, a change in practices for submitting and approving time. Ultimately, we strive to provide the accountability this program deserves.” Three CEOs in five years Private equity firms have taken over wide swaths of the health care industry in recent years and ill effects on care have been well-documented in independent academic research. PPL’s website does not identify its owners, but a recent court ruling disclosed the two private equity firms that control it — DW Healthcare Partners of Toronto and Park City, UT, and Linden Capital Partners of Chicago. In a lawsuit filed last year against New York’s Department of Health by a home care company over the transition to PPL, the company’s private equity owners were identified in a document that PPL requested the judge keep under seal. If the information were made public, the company argued, it “may put individuals in danger and/or allow them to become targets of violence.” Public disclosure would also increase the risk of “unwanted attention and harassment,” PPL said. The rule mandated that at least 80% of Medicaid payments go to compensation for direct care workers, such as personal assistants, not a company’s “administrative overhead or profit.” Fitzgerald said the company’s objections were not about worker compensation. Rather, she said, the company believed the rule would “make it more difficult for states to initiate new self-directed programs and to maintain small self-directed programs.” Participants in the CDPAP program aren’t the only ones experiencing upheaval in the transition to PPL. “I uploaded them nine times before they were finally accepted in their system.” Murphy’s hourly pay with PPL was 2% less than she had previously earned, she said, and she never received the correct pay under the new program. “Last year, when it was pushed upon us in the budget process I said back then that I thought it was a bad idea,” Rivera said of the switch to PPL. “Unfortunately, what I heard from my constituents is the transition was indeed bungled.” Meanwhile, Christian, the Buffalo mom who has lost five personal assistants since PPL took over, is especially worried about how it might impact her daughter.

Article: If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court. Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said. Advertisement In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers. Advertisement Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.” Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants. Advertisement The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.” Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions. The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.” California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law. “We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues. Advertisement The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out. Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities. “But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country. “The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote. In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it. They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.” The judge presiding over the case has yet to rule on the preliminary injunction.

Article: Since returning to power nearly seven months ago, Donald Trump has taken steps to exert unusual influence and control over everything from the economy to higher education, the judiciary to the media, private businesses to nonprofit organizations, the military to museums, labor unions to law enforcement, health care to sports teams, independent federal agencies to banks, the legal profession to the entertainment industry. NBC News reported: President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would host this year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, his latest move to revamp the Washington, D.C., cultural institution in his image. He didn’t explain who “they” might be, but Trump appointed himself chair of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees earlier this year, and he started naming loyalists to leadership roles at the institution while purging its traditionally bipartisan board. To hear the Republican tell it, he has maintained a hands-on role, personally rejecting prospective Kennedy Center honorees whom he considered “wokesters.” As for this year’s Kennedy Center honorees, the list includes singer George Strait, actor and comedian Michael Crawford, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor and the band Kiss. So to review, the sitting American president, who presumably has a day job that keeps him rather busy, has found time to lead the Kennedy Center, personally scrutinize prospective honorees, agree to host the center’s upcoming awards ceremony and approve an honor for one of his pals.

Article: ROME (AP) — A boat carrying nearly 100 migrants capsized Wednesday in international waters off the Italian island of Lampedusa, killing at least 26 people and leaving about a dozen missing, the Italian coast guard and U.N. The coast guard said in a statement that the death toll stood at 26, but was still “provisional and being updated.” Based on survivor accounts, about 95 migrants left Libya on two boats, International Organization for Migration spokesperson Flavio Di Giacomo said. Lampedusa Mayor Filippo Mannino said that the shipwreck happened “presumably at dawn.” So far this year, 675 migrants have died making the perilous central Mediterranean crossing, not counting the latest sinking, according to the U.N.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni — who made combating illegal immigration a top priority of her right-wing government — pledged on Wednesday to continue fighting “unscrupulous traffickers” by preventing irregular departures and managing migration flows. “That today’s tragedy occurred despite a ready and operational international response warns us that the necessary rescue effort is not sufficient and, above all, does not address the root causes of this tragic problem,” Meloni said in a statement.

Article: government’s ethics watchdog agency warned this week that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has failed to comply with an agreement that required him to divest his financial assets, posing potential conflicts of interest as he leads the Trump administration’s economic policy agenda. Bessent, who was formerly the top investor for the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros, said that he would do so to “avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest.” Cabinet officials are required to shed certain holdings and investments within 90 days of being confirmed to avoid the potential for conflicts of interest. Trump has pushed the boundaries of traditional government ethics norms by publicly pushing his business interests, and top Trump administration officials have reached unusual ethics agreements that have allowed them to oversee government matters that involve former lobbying clients or could benefit family members.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission voted unanimously in favor of the plan during a meeting that drew 168 people for a public hearing in the Panhandle town of Havana, with both supporters and opposents present. Opponents called the hunt cruel, unnecessary and an excuse for hunters to bag a trophy animal when the real issue is the encroaching human population in bear habitat as Florida continues to grow. “Right now, too many of our residents see bears as threats and pests.” There has been only one documented fatal black bear attack in Florida, the May mauling of 89-year-old Robert Markel and his daughter's dog in a rural part of Collier County, in southwest Florida.

Article: Billy Joel’s beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes Billy Joel's beloved motorcycle shop on Long Island, New York, is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes. The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge. Because it’s starting to be a lost aesthetic.” He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay — a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan — where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023. And I’d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.” Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist.

Article: Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and another possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case Weinstein could be sentenced next month, if no retrial on unresolved rape charge Harvey Weinstein appears in state court in Manhattan after a mistrial on a rape charge, Wednesday, Aug. (Steven Hirsch /New York Post via AP, Pool) NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and a possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case, but when they’ll happen — and whether he’ll be back in front of another jury — is still up in the air. At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn’t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013. Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they’re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he’d prefer a trial at “the earliest the court can accommodate us.” Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall. If a fall trial happens, it would likely put Weinstein’s high-profile #MeToo case back in court as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in the final throes of his reelection bid. Bragg, a first-term Democrat who made prosecuting sex crimes cases a priority, has expressed satisfaction with Weinstein's conviction on a criminal sex act charge in the Haley assault and has been resolute in wanting the Oscar-winning studio boss retried on the Mann rape charge. “This work, first and foremost, is about the survivors and that’s why we’re prepared to go forward.” Aidala told reporters outside court that, in his view, it’s on prosecutors to resolve the rape charge — either by dropping it and clearing the way for sentencing, or promptly taking it to trial again. The “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love” producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn’t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.

Article: Spencer Platt | Getty Images Goldman Sachs is taking the heat for its call that heavier tariff-induced consumer inflation is ahead, but it's far from alone in that view among its Wall Street brethren. "There is considerable uncertainty around the degree of pass-through to consumer prices, given that this year's tariff increases are well larger than anything in the post-war US experience." President Donald Trump lambasted Goldman Sachs on Tuesday for research the firm's economists released over the weekend asserting that consumers will take on a significantly stronger hit from tariffs through the end of the year. Inflation to creep higher Most see at least a steady grind higher in prices as tariff clarity emerges and what looks to be effective rates around 18% — compared with around 3% at the start of the year — take root, with some caveats. "We expect inflation to continue on a gradual upward trend as businesses pass along their higher costs, but slowing shelter inflation and push-back from increasingly stretched consumers should help offset some of the tariff impact." To be sure, no one is calling for runaway inflation — more like monthly gains of 0.3%-0.5%. Moreover, whatever the acceleration ends up being, it's not expected to dissuade the Fed from starting to lower interest rates after staying on the sidelines through all of 2025 so far. JPMorgan sees the hit to gross domestic product, two-thirds of which comes from consumption, at "a bit under 1%." The Blue Chip Economic Indicators report for August, which surveys the leading economic names on Wall Street, sees GDP growth averaging just 0.85% in the second half of this year. But that's actually better than the 0.75% forecast from July as some of the most pessimistic forecasters changed their outlooks on the view "that the constraining effect of tariffs is expected to be temporary, as projected growth improves considerably next year," the August report said.

Article: Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens. As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. Khames Alrefi / Anadolu via Getty Images Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request to comment on the incident, but at the time it told the BBC that early in the day it had "identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops" and "fired warning shots." It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired "hundreds of meters away" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West." He added, “I would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.” Polling before Oct. The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. “Despite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,” said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor’s chair at the University of California, Berkeley. Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the “Black September” civil war in 1970, leading to the militants’ eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon. The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country’s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target “Palestinian terrorists.” More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas. “The Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,” Crocker told NBC News. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.

During ABC13's Share Your School Supplies Drive 2025, people from across the Houston area, and really, southeast Texas, pulled together to raise money and collect supplies for teachers, and ultimately, students. HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The community has once again shown that it supports its teachers like no other through the 2025 Share Your School Supplies Drive, benefiting the Houston Food Bank's School Programs. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring "If you want to be educated right, you need the right resources." Here's how the community stepped up for teachers in Spring during Share Your School Supplies. We believe that we have to give back to our educators, our stations, and other organizations that helped build the community the way it is." Volunteers of all ages and across the city also recognized just how large of an impact these school supplies can make. "I think it's really important to be donating school supplies because if you want to be educated right, you need the right resources to be going to school every day, going to college every day," one Texas A &M University student helping at the Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring told ABC13. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Sugar Land Sugar Land was one of five areas where the community showed up and showed out to make sure area teachers have what they need. "We may have a child that may come and needs some supplies, and it'll be there for them, so it just helps us to continue to help our young people." Nivens said that with a ban now on digital devices, some of the most-needed supplies included pens and paper as well as hand sanitizer, folders, and tissue. Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites on Friday, Aug. "Our employees are passionate about education, and anything we can do to support students and teachers in our community, we want to be able to do, so here they are handing out school supplies and wanting to be engaged in this event," said Vickie Yakunin, head of community engagement at Amazon. "This helps build the confidence as well in the children, so we're trying to alleviate that sacrifice from teachers who are pulling out of their own pockets to do so." "We want to be there for the children to help instead," Rascon added. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

Article: Despite being American citizens, three children — a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl — were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families. The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms. “The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States. “This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News. “Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.” McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.” NBC News has previously reported on U.S. Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.” Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states. Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras. “When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.” DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Article: Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has signed into law a controversial piece of legislation that would shield the military, police and other government-sanctioned forces from prosecution for human rights abuses committed during the country’s decades-long internal conflict. On Wednesday, Boluarte held a signing ceremony at the presidential palace in Lima, where she defended the amnesty law as a means of honouring the sacrifices made by government forces. “It brings justice and honour to those who stood up to terrorism.” But human rights groups and international observers have condemned the bill as a violation of international law — not to mention a denial of justice for the thousands of survivors who lived through the conflict. In the case of the current amnesty law, nine UN experts issued a joint letter in July condemning its passage as a “clear breach of [Peru’s] obligations under international law”. But at Wednesday’s signing ceremony, President Boluarte reiterated her position that such international criticism was a violation of her country’s sovereignty and that she would not adhere to the Inter-American Court’s decision. Drawing from Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, the human rights group Amnesty International estimates that the country’s armed forces and police were responsible for 37 percent of the deaths and disappearances that happened during the conflict.

Article: Six reputed members and associates of the Hoover Criminal Gang were arrested Wednesday in what authorities called the first major takedown of a sex trafficking operation in the Figueroa Corridor of South Los Angeles. The Hoovers largely controlled sex trafficking and prostitution along a 3.5-mile stretch of Figueroa Street between approximately Slauson Avenue and Century Boulevard from February 2021 to August 2025, according to a 155-page federal indictment charging 11 people. Advertisement Victims were recruited through false promises of a luxurious lifestyle, intimidation, and actual or threatened violence and were plied with drugs ranging from the synthetic painkiller oxycodone to amphetamines, according to the indictment. Indicted alongside Armstead were Kenyondre Young, 22; Naziz Harris, 19; Derail Robinson, 22; Jalon Phillips, 22; Bryan Isrel, 31, Tejohn Gray, 25; and Tommy Crockham, 30, — all from South L.A. Advertisement Along with the RICO charge, the defendants are facing various other charges, including sex trafficking of minors; sex trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion; transportation of a minor for sex trafficking; sexual exploitation of a child; drug trafficking conspiracy; money laundering to promote specified unlawful activity; and conspiracy to straw purchase firearms. Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in L.A., called the operation “the first step in returning the Figueroa Corridor — long known as prostitution haven — back to its residents who have suffered for too long while criminals were allowed to run amok.” Advertisement “There are no meaningful consequences for their conduct under state law, so the federal government — aided by its local law enforcement partners — will step in to make sure these criminals face lengthy prison sentences,” Essayli said in a news release. Gang members and associates allegedly acted as pimps “by managing and monitoring their victims, pooling resources to rent several motel rooms for commercial sex dates … and sending each other money via Cash App and Apple Pay,” according to the U.S. Prosecutors said sex workers were required to have their hair and nails done at all times “because their grooming was a status symbol that reflected on her pimp.” Advertisement Victims were also branded with tattoos of a defendant’s moniker, according to the indictment. In one case in April 2022, Gray and two accomplices drove to an area of San Bernardino notorious for prostitution activities and allegedly attempted to force two women into their car. In April 2024, according to the indictment, Armstead and Evans allegedly rented rooms at the Stadium Inn, a South Los Angeles motel, including one in which a 14-year-old girl was sex trafficked for at least three consecutive days. Gang members also allegedly posted videos and photographs of their assaults on others to social media, “in order to intimidate their victims and ensure their compliance in performing commercial sex work for the enrichment of their pimps and the Hoover gang itself.” If convicted, some defendants would face a minimum of 15 years and potentially up to life in federal prison.

Article: Last month, I wrote about how the Trump administration’s deep cuts to the State Department budget and workforce had delayed a congressionally authorized annual report that the State Department compiles on international human rights. As NBC News noted, the report is a tenth as long as last year’s report and has already been condemned by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In a departure from previous reports, the Trumpified version completely omits sections dedicated to abuses against women and LGBTQ people, while criticizing “free speech” abuses by countries like Brazil and members of the European Union for attempting to curb the spread of far-right disinformation and hate speech. In the case of Brazil, the report also says the country’s judiciary has unfairly oppressed followers of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who is under house arrest while he is on trial on charges of plotting a coup (a charge he denies). For example, despite extensive documentation of human rights abuses by El Salvador’s MAGA-aligned, self-described dictator Nayib Bukele, the State Department claimed to find no “significant” abuses in the country to which the Trump administration renditioned several hundred immigrants. In its section on Israel, West Bank and Gaza, the report lists under the category “War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, and Evidence of Acts that May Constitute Genocide, or Conflict-related Abuses” only the following: “Terrorist organizations Hamas and Hizballah continue to engage in the indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians in violation of the law of armed conflict.” The report makes no reference to Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza or to tactics that some international groups have gone so far as to label genocide. Here’s how State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the revised report, according to NBC News: ‘The Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,’ Bruce said. I tend to think the statement given to NBC News last week by an unnamed department official ahead of the report’s release is a bit more apt, if not honest: ‘We call out certain abuses that we think deserve highlighting, but just because we focus on one instance does not mean that we are not aware of other instances of human rights abuses,’ the official added, noting that all 198 countries and territories were listed in the reports. So given the opportunity to call out human rights abuses, like those that target women and LGBTQ people, where it knows they exist, this administration seems to prefer to misuse this report to point to policies and places that don’t align with its right-wing ideology.

She said that it was a hopeful sign for Democrats, and that the frustration should make it easier for the party to raise money and “recruit legitimate challengers in some of these districts.” Menendez urged the party to seize the opportunity ahead of the midterm elections: “The fact that there is energy and there is a built-in narrative, which Democrats are now figuring out how to make cohesive, begins to set the stage for those midterms, no matter how far away they are.” You can watch Sanders Townsend and Menendez’s analysis in the clip at the top of the page.

READ MORE: Floodwaters from Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau break record levels and prompt evacuations A search was also ongoing Wednesday for a man who walked through a flooded road in Chattanooga on Tuesday night but hadn’t been seen since, Maxwell said. Troy Plemons, a communications systems technician for EPB, Chattanooga’s electricity and telecommunications utility, said he was stuck in traffic on an interstate in his bucket truck for two to three hours on Tuesday evening when the area started to flood quickly. Then Plemons said he saw the water pick up an SUV, and when he and two Lawson Electric workers encouraged a woman inside to get out, she threw up her hands like she didn’t know if she could. “I tried my best.” Plemons said the water was reaching neck level for the woman in the SUV when he used a boring bit offered by the Lawson Electric workers to break the window and helped the woman get out. “I was doing everything I could to get her out because the water was rising pretty quick.” He helped the woman to the road and she sat down in his vehicle to warm up for a while. There were several rescues of people whose cars were overwhelmed by water in the area until the water receded about two to three hours later and traffic began to move again, Plemons said. “I’m thankful I was there to help that lady.” The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of middle Tennessee through Wednesday night, warning of scattered flash flooding with tropical-like heavy rainfall and the possibility of training storms, especially over already saturated areas. The airport in Chattanooga recorded more than 6.4 inches (about 16 centimeters) of rain Tuesday, marking the second-wettest day recorded for the city dating back to 1879, according to a social media post by the National Weather Service in Morristown.

Hezbollah has rejected the plan, which followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy by Washington aimed at implementing a cease-fire deal signed last year with Israel that ended Lebanon’s deadliest conflict in decades. In recent months, Lebanon’s new government has faced mounting pressure from the United States and Gulf states to complete the group’s disarmament, a key step mandated by the cease-fire agreement reached in November.

Shane Daley, 40, is accused of placing multiple calls to Thompson's family member after the shooting, justifying the killing and saying that the person deserved to die in a similar manner, according to a criminal complaint. Daley, as alleged, gleefully welcomed this tragedy and did all that he could to increase the Thompson family’s pain and suffering." Thompson was fatally shot outside a hotel in New York City in December by a man who prosecutors said was angered over what he viewed as corporate greed.

Article: WASHINGTON — Billy Joel's beloved Long Island motorcycle shop is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes. The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay, New York, in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge. Because it’s starting to be a lost aesthetic.” He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay — a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan — where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023. And I’d like to get a little interest going into the town and the village.” Joel's nearby home in Centre Island is listed for $29.9 million, and he has been living in South Florida, while keeping a home in Sag Harbor on Long Island. In 1982, he was riding a motorcycle on Long Island when he was struck by a car that ran a red light, injuring his left thumb and dislocating his right wrist.

Article: Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that grant recipients challenging the freeze did not meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction restoring the flow of money. WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can suspend or terminate billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated funding for foreign aid. “The parties also dispute the scope of the district court’s remedy but we need not resolve it … because the grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,” Henderson wrote. “The majority opinion thus misconstrues the separation-of-powers claim brought by the grantees, misapplies precedent, and allows Executive Branch officials to evade judicial review of constitutionally impermissible actions.” The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for USAID to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs.

Article: A weak jobs report earlier this month revealed a sharp slowdown of the labor market, which could prompt the Fed to reduce borrowing costs as a means of warding off an economic slowdown, even if it opens up the possibility of higher inflation. Employers added an average of about 35,000 jobs over three months ending in July, which marks a major slowdown from roughly 128,000 jobs added monthly over the prior three months, the U.S. "The Fed will probably choose to make a cut in response." Economists acknowledged that tariff-induced inflation effects could lag behind the onset of the policy, giving policymakers a misguided sense of comfort with price levels. "It’s just coupled with a relatively worsening labor market." President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura/Reuters Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly urged the central bank to lower interest rates, saying the policy would boost economic performance and reduce interest payments on government debt. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate," Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, referring to the Fed chair, just hours after the favorable inflation report. "The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." In recent weeks, Trump has also slammed Powell, citing cost overruns tied to the central bank’s $2.5 billion building renovation project. The Fed attributes spending overruns to unforeseen cost increases, saying that its building renovation will ultimately "reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations," according to the central bank's website. Some analysts said central bankers may lean toward a rate cut in part due to Trump’s urgings, while others said the Fed would make its decision based solely on economic data. Political independence, Powell said last month, gives central bankers the "ability to make these very challenging decisions in ways that are focused on the data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks – and not on political factors."

The phrase “And, baby, that’s show business for you" also appeared when you googled Swift's name on Tuesday.

Article: A federal judge has ordered Ohio State University to resolve via mediation the remaining lawsuits filed by former students who claim it failed to protect them from a sexual predator on the school payroll. “Yet it is today’s Ohio State that must reckon with the consequences of that ugly past in these cases.” If the case went to trial and the accusers won, it would be a “pyrrhic” victory, Watson wrote. “The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education, is through a mutual resolution short of a trial,” the judge wrote. Watson, in his order, referred the cases to Layn Phillips, a former Oklahoma federal judge who mediated the lawsuits filed against Michigan State by some 200 women athletes who were sexually abused by sports doctor Larry Nasser. 27, 2026 to provide the court with a progress report “at which point the Court will consider whether additional mediation would be productive.” In the meantime, lawyers for OSU and the plaintiffs will be allowed to continue taking depositions from witnesses. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News last month. He was deposed about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called “Surviving Ohio State,” in which one of the wrestlers he once coached called him a liar. A spokesperson for Ohio State, Benjamin Johnson, also declined to comment, saying via email, “We don’t typically comment on pending litigation." Ohio State found itself under fire in 2018 after a whistleblowing former wrestler named Mike DiSabato went public with allegations that Strauss had sexually abused him and hundreds of other athletes and that the school knew about it but did nothing to stop him. An independent investigation sponsored by Ohio State and conducted by the Perkins Coie law firm concluded in May 2019 that Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male athletes and students and that coaches and administrators knew about it for two decades but failed to stop him. Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized “to each person who endured” abuse at the hands of Strauss.

Article: The two-to-one ruling on Wednesday overturned a previous injunction that required the Department of State to resume the payments, including about $4bn for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and $6bn for HIV and AIDS programmes. However, the panel’s third judge — Florence Pan, nominated under former President Joe Biden — issued a dissenting opinion that argued Trump should not be allowed to violate the separation of powers by cutting the aid. “The court’s acquiescence in and facilitation of the Executive’s unlawful behaviour derails the carefully crafted system of checked and balanced power that serves as the greatest security against tyranny — the accumulation of excessive authority in a single Branch,” Pan wrote in her opinion. Republicans, however, control both houses of Congress, and in July, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 2025, allowing the government to claw back nearly $9bn in foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. US District Judge Amir Ali previously ruled that the Trump administration must pay its agreed-upon funds to humanitarian groups and other contractors that partnered with the government to distribute aid.

Article: President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he will seek more permanent federal control of the Washington, D.C., police force as he continues his efforts to ramp-up crime enforcement in the nation's capital. Earlier this week, Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops in the nation's capital, declaring a public safety emergency in order to put the Washington police department under federal control and station the National Guard on the city's streets. Asked Wednesday whether he'd work with Congress to extend the emergency authorization allowing him to seize temporary control of local law enforcement, Trump said he'll ask Congress for a "long-term" extension of federal control of the Washington police force. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images "We're going to be asking for extensions on that -- long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days," Trump said at an event at the Kennedy Center Wednesday afternoon. Trump has long threatened to take control of Washington, saying he wants to crack down on violent crime in the District although police statistics show that in the past two years, violent crime has fallen dramatically.

It’s likewise fair for Trump to press each side to compromise, and many Ukrainians seem ready to make concessions: More than two-thirds said in a Gallup poll that they favor a speedy negotiated end to the war, rather than fighting on until victory.

The White House said the review is aimed at portraying a more uplifting view of American history, but the administration has not specified who would be involved in evaluating the Smithsonian content. The White House did say the review would involve collaboration among museum staff, administration officials and personnel from other agencies, though it did not say what those other agencies are. Trump has been at odds with historians since his first term, when many criticized his push to promote what he sees as “patriotic history.” Early in his second term, he stirred deep alarm when he issued an executive order, titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which criticized what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” That order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” It directed Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to take action to redirect it toward promoting “American greatness.”

In July, when Trump first announced the plan, Robert Perosa, president of industry trade group Brazilian Beef Exporters Associations (ABIEC), said that the tariffs would make it “economically unfeasible” to continue to export to the US market. Advertisement Trump has directly tied the 50 percent tariff on many imported Brazilian goods to the judicial situation of his embattled ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest. In late July, the White House said that the order to impose this rate of tariffs is because of “the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil”.

The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not “diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.” “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” HHS Secretary Robert F. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.” Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants The 1996 Personal Responsibility Reconciliation Act restricted the eligibility for federal public benefits to certain “qualified” immigrants, according to KFF, a health policy group. Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that "reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive."

Article: In the hours that followed, they stole two more vehicles before ending up in a Chevrolet Silverado under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights, shielded from the police and TV helicopters overhead. (ONSCENE TV) Advertisement Over the years, pursuit suspects have tried to evade police by driving into parking garages or into Los Angeles International Airport, where there are flight restrictions for news choppers, or trying to run for it. A 2017 Los Angeles County civil grand jury report studied 421 police pursuits in the county that were reported to the California Highway Patrol and found that suspects were immediately apprehended in 67% of the chases, leaving 139 pursuits that did not end in an arrest. In the case of the Sunday chase, police are processing forensics from the stolen vehicles including a loaded gun discovered to see if that can link them to the suspects. They drove the truck which had “Got Milk” signs displayed on the mud flaps along the 5 freeway and 101 freeway through Studio City, Hollywood and downtown and at times went onto surface streets. “They go through the aqueducts or other exits and someone could be waiting for them,” Obayashi said, adding that police often don’t have time to react and set up a perimeter.

Article: Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in waterways through flooding, creating ideal conditions for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike. According to the Minnesota State Health Department, infections are mainly discovered during the summer months of July, August and September because hot weather means higher water temperatures and lower water levels. Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from the amoeba. States monitor waterways during summer months Louisiana, which has numerous warm and shallow waterways because of its proximity to the gulf and marshy terrain, has had numerous reports over the past decade where health officials found samples of Naegleria fowleri in the state's public water systems.

Article: 'Our children are dying' - rare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan city 19 minutes ago Share Save Barbara Plett Usher Africa correspondent, BBC News Share Save Watch: BBC obtains rare video from inside besieged el-Fasher in Sudan The women at the community kitchen in the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher are sitting in huddles of desperation. Our suffering is worse than what you can imagine." Food is so scarce in el-Fasher that prices have soared to the point where money that used to cover a week's worth of meals can now buy only one. This may be the only meal these children get for a day The hunger crisis is compounded by a surge of cholera sweeping through the squalid camps of those displaced by the fighting, which escalated this week into one of the most intense RSF attacks on the city yet. The paramilitaries tightened their 14-month blockade after losing control of the capital Khartoum earlier this year, and stepped up their battle for el-Fasher, the last foothold of the armed forces in Darfur. The UN has amplified its appeal for a humanitarian pause to allow food convoys into the city, with its Sudan envoy Sheldon Yett once more demanding this week that the warring sides observe their obligations under international law. "We have many malnourished children admitted in hospital but unfortunately there is no single sachet of [therapeutic food]," says Dr Ibrahim Abdullah Khater, a paediatrician at the Al Saudi Hospital, noting that the five severely malnourished children currently in the ward also have medical complications. Unfortunately, the international community is just watching." International non-governmental organisations working in Sudan issued an urgent statement this week declaring that "sustained attacks, obstruction of aid and targeting of critical infrastructure demonstrate a deliberate strategy to break the civilian population through hunger, fear, and exhaustion". Makeshift centres have been built to treat patients who have cholera Unlike el-Fasher, in Tawila aid workers at least have access, but their supplies are limited, says John Joseph Ocheibi, the on-site project coordinator for a group called The Alliance for International Medical Action. "We are mobilizing resources to see how best we can be able to respond." Sylvain Penicaud of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) estimates there are only three litres of water per person per day in the camps, which, he says, is "way below the basic need, and forces people to get water from contaminated sources".

Article: There’s a “public safety crisis” and “public safety emergency” in the District of Columbia, the Republican claimed, which is reflected in crime in the nation’s capital that is “rising” and “out of control.” As is often the case with this White House, reality quickly got in the way of the partisan talking points. initiative, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller — who recently made headlines for peddling weird claims about immigrant crime in Minneapolis — published an item to social media that read: Crime stats in big blue cities are fake. The falsehood-per-sentence ratio in this little missive was, in a rather literal sense, 1:1, though it is interesting to see Team Trump add crime statistics to its list of “fake” things, joining U.S. What’s more, let’s not forget that the FBI’s controversial director appeared at the president’s press conference on Monday, when Patel boasted from the White House podium, “The murder rates are plummeting. history.” That was true, though if Miller correct, the boast from Trump’s FBI director should be discarded — because crime stats in cities led by Democratic officials are “fake,” which necessarily throws off the bureau’s figures.

Article: is not short, but this was especially egregious: The conspiracy theorist, who has a lengthy record of promoting bizarre and unscientific ideas, announced that he and the Trump administration are terminating a series of federal contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines. Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, told The Associated Press: “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business.” Around the same time, Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the surgeon general during Donald Trump’s first term, added via social media: “I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions — but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives.” The president tried to defend the decision, but failed. Bhattacharya, a deeply unfortunate choice to lead the NIH, conceded in his opinion piece that the mRNA platform is “promising,” and has the potential to “deliver breakthroughs.” So why in the world is the Republican administration, as Bhattacharya put it, “winding down its mRNA vaccine development activities”? His Post piece stressed a few points, but this was the heart of his defense: [A]s a vaccine intended for broad public use, especially during a public health emergency, the platform has failed a crucial test: earning public trust. The NIH director bolstered his point by pointing to polls showing Americans’ reluctance to get Covid booster shots, which were developed through mRNA research, before peddling some baseless claims about the Biden administration’s “scientific overreach” and “arrogance.” So, let’s take stock. “The vaccines that harnessed it against Covid saved an estimated 20 million lives, a rapid development that was recognized with a Nobel Prize.” The same Times report added that mRNA research has raised hopes of possible treatments — and perhaps even cures — for deadly cancers and a host of genetic and chronic diseases. Even Trump himself has celebrated mRNA vaccines — the president explicitly referred to them as a “modern-day miracle” — before he put the nation’s public health infrastructure in the hands of a guy who has claimed, among other things, that Wi-Fi causes “leaky brain.” But according to the NIH director, the scientific potential apparently doesn’t matter. What does matter, Bhattacharya argued, is that mRNA research hasn’t “earned public trust.” To be sure, I’m not in a position to say which areas of scientific research have been embraced by the American mainstream.

Article: Ahead of Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, The New York Times appeared to give the American president something new to talk about with his Russian counterpart. investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia “is at least partly responsible for a recent hack of the computer system that manages federal court documents, including highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes.” The report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.” Those with sensitive documents within the system have apparently been advised to quickly remove them. The internal memo to Justice Department officials and staffers from the courts system, according to the Times, added: “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.” This was, in other words, a rather serious cyberoffensive. After noting that he “could” bring this up during his scheduled talks with Putin, Trump added that Russian cyberattackers are “good at it.” In other words, there’s reason to believe a foreign adversary launched an offensive targeting highly sensitive U.S. The developments came on the heels of Trump backing off threatened sanctions on Russia — for the fifth time — and extending an invitation to Putin to come to American soil, giving the accused war criminal the validation he was looking for.

Article: MIAMI (AP) — The fate of a makeshift immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” hung in the balance on Wednesday as a federal judge considered whether building on sensitive wetlands violated environmental laws. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing, part of a lawsuit seeking to halt operations and further construction. DeSantis blindsided Florida county officials with ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ plans, emails show The judge concluded a multi-day hearing on Wednesday without making an immediate decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction. President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe have sued over the facility, saying it was hastily set up without the environmental impact considerations needed for all federal projects, even though it deals with immigration, a federal matter. Ron DeSantis has said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after. When asked by the judge why a detention facility needed to be located in the middle of the Everglades, Jesse Panuccio, an attorney representing the state of Florida, referred to government officials’ statements that the remote location and existing runway made it ideal for immigration detention. “Why in the middle of the Everglades?” Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers. Chris Ajizian, an attorney for the Miccosukee Tribe, said that neither the state nor federal government gave the tribe any notice of their plans for a detention facility, despite legal obligations and the tribe’s incontrovertible connection to the Everglades.

Article: Jeff Chiu | AP Perplexity AI's bid on Tuesday to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion represents a dramatic moment for the internet search giant, a week before it celebrates the 20th anniversary of its IPO. Department of Justice, which filed the landmark case against Google in 2020, indicated after its victory in court that it was considering a possible breakup of Google as an antitrust remedy. Google Legal Chief Kent Walker said in response to the DOJ that its "approach would result in unprecedented government overreach" and would harm the country's effort to maintain economic and tech leadership. The company is shelling out tens of billions of dollars a year on artificial intelligence infrastructure and AI services while facing the risk that consumers will be spending a lot less time on traditional search as ChatGPT and other AI-powered alternatives provide new ways to access information. "This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google," co-founder Larry Page said in a blog post at the time. Page moved from CEO of Google to become chief executive of Alphabet, promoting Sundar Pichai, who had been a senior vice president in charge of internet businesses, to run Google. With an increasingly dominant position on the internet, Pichai and team have had to continue looking for growth areas, particularly in AI, while simultaneously fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. Here's a breakdown of how some analysts value Alphabet's top non-search assets: Chrome watch now The browser is key to Alphabet's ad business, which uses data from Chrome to help with targeted advertisements. Google originally launched Chrome in 2008 as an effort to "add value for users and, at the same time, help drive innovation on the web." Perplexity's offer doesn't stack up to analyst estimates, but it's still much higher than Perplexity's own valuation, which reached $18 billion in July. If a deal for Chrome is on the table, analysts at Raymond James value the browser at $50 billion, based on 2.25 billion users and Google's revenue share agreements with phone manufacturers that preinstall Chrome on devices. Bob O'Donnell of market research firm TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that Chrome is "not directly monetizable," because it serves as a gateway and that it's "not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective." Google Cloud A person takes a photo of the Google Cloud logo, during the 2025 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, March 4, 2025. Albert Gea | Reuters Google's cloud unit, which is third in the cloud infrastructure market behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, is one of Alphabet's key growth engines and its biggest business outside of digital advertising. Demand is so high that the company's cloud services now have a backlog, a measure of future committed revenue, of $106 billion, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the earnings call. Davidson analysts, who have the highest ascribed valuation at $682 billion, and TD Cowen analysts note that while Google still trails AWS and Azure, it's growing faster than Amazon's cloud business and has the potential for a premium valuation. Mat Hayward | Variety | Getty Images Google's $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 is generally viewed as one of the best acquisitions ever by an internet company, alongside Facebook's $1 billion deal for Instagram in 2012. Dubbing it the "new king of all media," MoffettNathanson values YouTube at between $475 billion and $550 billion, arguing that it's larger and more powerful than any other player in Hollywood. When Alphabet was formed as Google's parent company, it created an "Other Bets" category to include businesses that it liked to call "moonshots," a term that had already made its way into Google lexicon.

Article: President Donald Trump announced federal take over of the Metropolitan Police Department under the Home Rule Act to assist in crime prevention in the nation’s capital, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 12, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump called Washington, D.C., a city overrun by "violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" as he moved to federalize the city's police force and deploy hundreds of National Guard members. His dire depiction of the nation's capital is at odds, however, with federal data showing that violent crime in the District has dropped to its lowest level in three decades. Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty Images Washington experienced a spike in crime in 2023, with the highest number of homicides reported in the District since the 1990s and a surge in the number of reported carjackings. Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst and co-founder of data analytics firm AH Datalytics, told CNBC that Americans broadly "always think crime is rising," even if the data shows otherwise. A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters — 68% — said that reducing crime should be a top policy priority for the president and Congress in 2024, compared to 47% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Asher told CNBC that policymakers should not "base their crime-reduction strategies and policy and programs on the perception issue." He said that policy decisions should be based on data, but to make "people feel safe, we have to address the perception issue." "I think that they're two very different sides of a similar coin," he continued.

He took a direct role in a peace pledge signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, at the White House, and there have been other regional conflicts in which he’s played an important role. Those, of course, are the Israel-Hamas war and the Russian war with Ukraine, which he famously declared that he would solve in 24 hours, on the basis of his long and, in his view, respectful relationship with Putin. He has now come to question whether that relationship is what he thought it was, or at least what he portrayed it as, because Putin has held a series of perfectly friendly, constructive phone calls with him and then continued on the same battle plan that he was on before, with considerable recent success.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. — Adam Wollner Texas Democrats plot their exit strategy By Ben Kamisar and Natasha Korecki With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the talks. What we will do, what we’re going to do in the future, we’re in discussions right now,” Texas Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu said Wednesday on “Meet the Press NOW.” Wu said they would not finalize their next steps until there was “consensus among our membership.” But he noted Democrats have other avenues to push back against the GOP’s redistricting effort in the courts, through the legislative process and with other states, like California, countering with new congressional maps. We can throw everything at this.” Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum in the state House so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. So while it appears likely that Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. Alex Brandon / AP President Donald Trump is not just taking over the police in the nation’s capital, with FBI and DEA agents on nighttime patrols in Georgetown and armored vehicles lined up in front of the Washington Monument. Trump also told reporters he was “98%” involved in choosing this year’s honorees for one of the nation’s highest lifetime achievement awards: Sylvester Stallone, Michael Crawford, George Strait, Gloria Gaynor and Kiss. Unlike his predecessors, Trump never hosted the awardees at the White House nor attended the gala concert in his first term, citing criticism from some of the Hollywood stars being celebrated. Elsewhere in Washington, the administration now plans to put its stamp on eight of the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, including American history, African American history, air and space, and the National Museum of the American Indian. The criticism by many, if not most, historians is that this risks distorting the reality of America’s founding, which includes the reality that the genius of the Founding Fathers’ creation was scarred by the reality that they were all white, male and largely property owners — including many slave owners. It spawned a reckoning that eventually led to the brutality of the Civil War, followed by a century of legalized segregation, and continuing generational poverty and second-class citizenship for millions of Americans. The administration has already had an impact on the Smithsonian, whose board is led by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and by statute also includes the vice president. According to the 6,000-member Organization of American Historians, the nation’s museums and historic parks are “under assault” by Trump’s March 27 executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” A White House spokesman calls it common sense.

Article: Illinois courts will not force Texas Democrats back to the state, a judge ruled Wednesday, dealing a blow to Attorney General Ken Paxton and House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ efforts to restore the headcount necessary to pass the GOP’s new congressional map. Illinois courts’ cannot consider whether “foreign legislators” were willfully evading their duties, and they cannot direct Illinois law enforcement to execute civil quorum warrants upon “nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois,” Larson said, noting that the warrants specifically say they are to be enforced within Texas. Even if the court were to take up the case, which Larson ruled it lacks the ability to do, the response would be a ruling on whether the lawmakers are willfully disobeying a court order — not an order returning them to Texas as Paxton and Burrows demanded, Larson said. The county voted for Trump by 47 percentage points in 2024, suggesting Paxton was seeking a friendlier venue than he might have found in DuPage County — where the Democrats are staying — which went for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 14 points.

Article: The songwriter Anaïs Mitchell described it in an interview as “absolutely perfect, a whole world, novella, philosophy encapsulated in three verses and a coda.” The song’s lines read, in part: The autumn leaves are tumbling down and winter’s almost here But through the spring and summertime we laughed away the year And now we can be grateful for the gift of memory For I remember having fun Two happy hearts that beat as one When I had thought that we were we But we were you and me. “It’s everything.” It’s no wonder Drake’s songs brim with feeling: Her life was marked by debilitating anxiety in early adulthood; a wartime separation from her husband; and the devastating loss of her son in 1974, when he was 26. (Nick Drake’s own work has received renewed interest with the release last month of the boxed set “The Making of Five Leaves Left.”) Yet for all her struggles, she guarded her inner life. “She made her mystery available to us, without revealing what it was.” She added: “She was a bit of an enigma.” Molly Drake’s wry humor and poetic flavor are evident in original compositions like “Night Is My Friend” that reveal her to be a forerunner of the confessional singer-songwriter movement that emerged in the 1960s and ’70s.

Article: Now researchers at UC Riverside have found that home sale prices are 2.4% to 5.4% lower than they would be if the land were stable, translating to per-home losses of $6,689 to $16,165. Mehdi Nemati, a UC Riverside assistant professor of environmental economics and policy who led the study, said his team knew that sinking land was already affecting homes and homeowners across the Central Valley, with cracking foundations, dry wells, higher insurance premiums and increased stress. “Land subsidence is a very slow problem.” The economists found that land subsidence has lowered the value of homes across eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley by $1.87 billion over the six-year period. “And I expect that land subsidence is going to be very low on their list of things that they think affect the price.” Agricultural wells have been drawing heavily on groundwater, lowering aquifer levels. In another recent study , Stanford University researchers also found that the problem has been worsening in recent years, and that large portions of the valley have subsided at a record pace since 2006. Advertisement The study’s findings show that lower home values are one more costly effect of chronic groundwater overpumping that warrants attention, said Amanda Fencl, climate science director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. The goal, Fencl said, should be to prevent the “very clear harms that are occurring from this extensive groundwater overuse.” She said she hopes the link between subsidence and home values will lead to a “rallying cry” from people in the valley who feel it’s unfair that “we aren’t the ones pumping, and yet you’re affecting our ability to maintain and sell our homes.” The researchers said it’s a major problem that requires big solutions — and fast. Areas with rapid subsidence dropped about 7 or more inches a year across the eight counties they studied, with parts of Tulare and Kings counties seeing the most dramatic movement, up to a foot or more a year. She blames the ongoing implementation of the state’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act as well as “bad actors,” including hedge funds and other outside investors that are among the region’s major water users.

Article: In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan off following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on Aug. AFP via Getty Images Russian media is crowing about the choice of location for the summit -- cheering the idea that Trump and Putin will decide the fate of the war alone and that Alaska's distance from Europe underlines how European countries and Ukraine are being sidelined. Some Russian media commentators also note how Alaska was once Russian territory, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the United States for a pittance in 1867 Many observers, particularly Russian, are dismissing the meeting as a sign Trump has allowed Putin to once again deceive him. Some Russian analysts have suggested the surprise summit, in fact, is a graceful way for both Putin and Trump to sidestep the awkward issue of Trump's own deadline last week to impose the new sanctions if Russia didn't end the war. "For Trump, it's an opportunity to save face in a situation when he actually has few ways of pressuring Moscow," Farida Rustamova and Margarita Lituova, Russian journalists who closely cover the Kremlin, wrote on their Substack. "For Putin, a personal meeting would help him to maintain a relationship with Trump, who is clearly inclined to sympathize with the Russian position." Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference during his visit to Vienna, Austria, June 16, 2025. has received a signal from Russia that it may be "ready to end the war, or at least to make a first step towards a ceasefire." "This was the first such signal from them," Zelenskyy told reporters. The Wall Street Journal and others have reported Putin is now demanding Ukraine hand over the remainder of unoccupied eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in exchange for halting his offensive on two other southeastern regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But those demands would still be extreme -- Ukraine would be giving up a huge swath of territory, home to hundreds of thousands of people and important defensive strongholds, in exchange for almost nothing. Andrii Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told ABC News he believes Putin will almost certainly propose demands he knows are unacceptable so that Ukraine will alienate Trump by rejecting them.

A Tract spokesperson said last week in a statement to The Charlotte Observer that the company was “both disappointed and surprised” by the mayor’s previous comments indicating he no longer supported the project. When he wasn’t at the racetrack, he was an avid outdoorsman, and neighbors said he used the North Carolina property at the center of the recent battle for hunting and fishing. Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s eldest son, blasted efforts to rezone the property on social media recently, saying his father “would be livid for his name to be associated” with the project. Wednesday’s announcement makes Mooresville the latest city where developers have either backed off their plans for a data center, or had their plans for a data center voted down by local leaders amid public backlash. “We can’t just take rural residential land and destroy it forever.” Late last week, Carney, the mayor, cast doubts on the project’s prospects because Tract hadn’t said which tech company would ultimately use the facility once it was built.

Article: 13 Investigates: New Uvalde records show district limited information, teachers felt ignored UVALDE, Texas (KTRK) -- After a teenager killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one teacher told the district's superintendent, "it feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." On June 12, 2022, a Robb Elementary teacher whose classroom sustained gunshots through its windows recalled details of the attack in an email to the superintendent. I had shrapnel in my back from when he shot in my window, I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students." I told my students I loved them, I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray. Robb Elementary School teacher In an email sent 19 days after the deadly shooting, the teacher said she gave every part of herself to the school and her friends and students who died gave their lives. We were asked to be patient and understanding, so I have; but it feels as if the Rodd (sic) staff that survived, especially us in that 4th grade building are being ignored. It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." That teacher's email was among thousands of pages of emails released this week by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District and provides a peek into behind-the-scenes communications at the district in the days and weeks after the shooting. RELATED: Uvalde school district releases records for 2022 classroom shooting after legal fight over access Previously released body camera video shows Uvalde CISD police and other responding officers stood in the hallway for 77 minutes before breaching the classroom on May 24, 2022. Uvalde CISD records for the now-deceased shooter Salvador Ramos indicate he was absent for 161 days during the 2019-2020 school year and considered "at risk." Notes in his student file say he "has excessive absences and is missing a lot of work," and that he is "failing due to unsubmitted assignments." He was ranked near the end of his class as the 312th student out of 318 students. He withdrew from Uvalde High School in October 2021 for "poor academic performance" and "lack of attendance." Seven months later, Ramos crashed his car near Robb Elementary, entered with an assault rifle, went into a classroom, and within minutes fired more than 100 rounds at elementary school students and teachers. Four days after the shooting, an email from Uvalde CISD's director of student services to nearly 20 employees reminding them not to share campus safety plans with reporters or other outside sources because they are "not public information." "I watched a couple news reports last night and unfortunately there is information being reported that is not accurate. Review your plans and be refreshed on what you have in place and what deficiencies you have at your campus and how they are being addressed," the director said in an email on May 28, 2025. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, told ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." 13 Investigates reached out to Uvalde CISD and asked if the district's perception changed after more information came out about how things played out that day. "We have pledged to inform our families and the greater Uvalde school community about the release of these documents before they are made available to the media, and this notice serves to uphold that promise," the district said.

Article: President Donald Trump says homeless people in the nation’s capital will be moved far from the city as part of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia and crackdown on crime. takeover as statistics show decline in crime With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. Washington’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.” READ MORE: Why this widespread form of homelessness is often overlooked and unsupported Citing a city regulation that she said gives local police “the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments,” Leavitt said homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services.” Those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.” In the past five months, the U.S. Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed. He said the outreach would continue through the week with a “greater level of urgency.” Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.” What are people in Washington saying? Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call. Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said. Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday’s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. “There’s a very good chance that we’re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I’m going to find out where we are and what we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there.” The president also said Russia will face “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war.

Defenders popped up with Spurs’ goals, with Micky van de Ven showing quick reactions to prod home the opener in the 39th minute after new PSG goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha’s shot onto the crossbar. Chevalier – playing ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced Tuesday he was leaving PSG – might have been unlucky with the first goal but was to blame for the second after failing to keep out a header from newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero in the 48th. Advertisement Tottenham is further along in its preparations for the new campaign than PSG, whose players have only just returned to training after being involved in the Club World Cup until mid-July, and looked much sharper at Stadio Friuli. PSG finished strongly, though, and hit Tottenham with late goals as Lee smashed in a low shot from the edge of the area and Ramos headed home Ousmane Dembele’s right-wing cross. Frank took over in the offseason following the firing of Ange Postecoglou, who led Tottenham to its first trophy in 17 years with a victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final in May. “I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world – maybe the best in this moment in time,” Frank told TNT Sports. It is a flip of a coin when you go into a penalty shootout.” PSG completed the Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season, also winning the Trophee des Champions in January.

Article: Stop Killing Civilians” on the pitch before the Super Cup football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham in Udine, Italy, in the wake of heavy fallout over its meek tribute to a Palestinian player killed by Israel. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah last week criticised a UEFA tribute to the late Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pele”, after European football’s governing body failed to reference the circumstances surrounding his killing. Salah responded, “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Speaking to Al Jazeera last week, Bassil Mikdadi, the founder of Football Palestine, said he did not expect the football body to respond to the criticism. Advertisement “Suleiman al-Obeid is not the first Palestinian footballer to perish in this genocide – there’s been over 400 – but he’s by far the most prominent as of now.” Salah, one of the Premier League’s biggest stars, has advocated for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza during the nearly two-year-long war. The banner move came a day after the UEFA Foundation for Children announced its latest initiative to help children affected by war in different parts of the world – a partnership with Medecins du Monde, Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF), and Handicap International.

Article: Petition to recall Texas City mayor did not meet minimum number of signatures, city says Texas City Mayor Dedrick Johnson vowed not to resign in an interview with ABC13, an hour after critics delivered a recall petition to city hall. The video above is from the original report: Texas City mayor won't resign after recall petition submitted On Wednesday, Texas City officials announced they were only able to validate 989 of the approximately 1,600 signatures that were reportedly submitted. The TCMPA sent a response to Wednesday's outcome, which read, in part: "The Texas City Municipal Police Association (TCMPA) board would like to extend its deepest gratitude to the citizens, officers, and community leaders who supported the recent effort to recall Mayor Dedrick Johnson. We are incredibly proud of the courage, unity, and support displayed by those who stood with us not just for the interests of law enforcement, but for the greater good of Texas City. The TCMPA remains steadfast in its mission to advocate for transparency, accountability, and respect for the dedicated officers who serve our city, as well as the citizens who call Texas City home. We also acknowledge with concern the multiple reports of blatant acts of retaliation faced by both officers and citizens who simply legally exercised their right to support this democratic process, as well as allegations of the unlawful release of confidential information by city officials that we ensure will be investigated by the attorney generals office." The city said it would take no further action advancing the petition, adding that the forgery allegations would be investigated.

Article: 9 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save Reuters The pictures from last week's sit-in protest in Parliament Square over the banned group Palestine Action were unprecedented. As demonstrators held up placards reading, "I support Palestine Action", some 522 of them were arrested on suspicion of breaking terrorism laws - more than double the total such arrests in 2024. The battle over the ban on Palestine Action (PAG) - last month, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - now feels as much a political and PR battle as a legal one. And the organisers of the campaign are trying to capitalise on perceived sympathy among some of the public by organising another demonstration in September - hoping to force the state, through numbers, to lift the ban. "I've seen police look incredibly uncomfortable with the fact that they are having to treat these elderly people as criminals," said solicitor Katie McFadden, who advised many protesters, after their arrests, last Saturday. "I've seen them in police custody and they've certainly been considerate and looked, frankly, quite shocked and horrified that this is what they were having to do as part of their job when they've signed up to go out and protect the public from dangerous criminals." The real challenge for the police and prosecutors is how many protesters do they need to charge with support of a banned terrorist organisation to send a message to the public. EPA The average age of those arrested was 54, police say, with 112 over the age of 70 So far, three people have been charged with displaying an item showing support for Palestine Action during the first demonstration on 5 July. The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had to consult the Attorney General's Office before he could go ahead with the charges because of additional safeguards in some terrorism cases. That means that Lord Hermer, the Attorney General and also a cabinet minister, or his deputy, may have to be involved in each of the files that police send to prosecutors. That, in turn, means the vast majority of the 700 may not know for months if they are going to end up on trial - in cases that could be more than a year away from a jury. Huda Ammori, Palestine Action's co-founder, has said on social media: "The system can't cope when thousands resist." EPA But ministers hope that the difference between the organisation she founded and other forms of protest over Gaza will become clear thanks to the second of the three linked legal battles soon to take centre stage. That incident prompted national security officials and the police to look at whether a terrorism ban on PAG could be justified, after having previously concluded that the vast majority of its highly disruptive activities amounted to minor criminal damage. Metropolitan Police The police set up two arrest processing points in central London to deal with the number of protesters who were arrested Documents disclosed to the BBC in the High Court show how the thinking on a ban had evolved. So when Cooper banned PAG, her decision was largely informed by what the Home Office has described as millions of pounds of criminal damage, not an assessment that it was a group of murderous militants. "There may be people who are objecting to proscription who don't know the full nature of this organisation due to court restrictions on reporting while serious prosecutions are under way but it's really important that no one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock If the ban is overturned in the High Court then hundreds of those arrested would see their cases collapse

Article: New York’s attorney general has sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case under the Trump administration FILE - Options to use the Zelle payments network are seen on a mobile banking app in New York, Dec. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) NEW YORK -- New York's attorney general on Wednesday sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case as the Trump administration was gutting the agency. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year dropped a similar case after President Donald Trump fired the agency's leader and his administration halted nearly all the bureau's work, closed its headquarters and moved to fire many of its workers. In a statement, James' office noted that its suit was filed after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned its lawsuit following a “change in the federal administration.” “No one should be left to fend for themselves after falling victim to a scam,” James said in a statement. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures.” James has been a leading antagonist of Trump, a Republican, and has sued him dozens of times. Last week, The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that the Justice Department has subpoenaed James as part of an investigation into whether she violated Trump's civil rights, according to people familiar with the matter. In one instance cited by the attorney general's office, a Zelle user got a call from someone posing as an employee of the utility company Con Edison who told the user that his electricity was going to be shut off unless he sent them money through Zelle. The user then transferred about $1,500 to a Zelle account named “Coned Billing" and then realized he had been scammed but was told by his bank that he could not get his money back, James' office said. In a statement issued through a spokesperson, Zelle called James' lawsuit “a political stunt to generate press, not progress.” “The Attorney General should focus on the hard facts, stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law, not overreach and meritless claims,” the statement said.

Article: The governor of New Mexico has declared a state of emergency in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities SANTA FE, N.M. -- The governor of New Mexico declared a state of emergency Wednesday in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities. Michelle Lujan Grisham makes $750,000 available in response to calls by local governments and tribal officials in Rio Arriba County for reinforcements against violent crime as well as other crime and hardships associated with illicit drugs. The vast area stretches from the city of Española, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Santa Fe, to the Colorado state line and has long been afflicted by opioid use and high drug-overdose death rates, with homeless encampments emerging in recent years in more populated areas. “The surge in criminal activity has contributed to increased homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses, placing extraordinary strain on local governments and police departments that have requested immediate state assistance," Lujan Grisham said in a statement. In April, Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency in New Mexico’s largest city, Albuquerque, saying that a significant increase in crime in Albuquerque warrants the help of the New Mexico National Guard. The tribal governor of Santa Clara Pueblo on the edge of Española urged the state to address a growing public safety crisis stemming from the use and abuse of fentanyl and alcohol in the community at large. “But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime, and increased homelessness extend to the wider community.” In 2020, President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime.

Article: Plans to expand the oldest wildlife refuge in Texas have been scrapped in favor of President Donald Trump’s effort to “unleash American energy.” The reversal, which was announced last month, has conservationists and advocates concerned about the future of wildlife in the Texas High Plains. At the refuge, located in the small town of Muleshoe about 68 miles northwest of Lubbock, the plan aimed to protect and restore grasslands that are an essential habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Jodey Arrington and Ronny Jackson, Republicans who represent the region and called the acquisition a “land grab.” However, the Biden plan was voluntary, and the service would have worked with willing sellers to expand conservation efforts. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to reducing regulatory burdens, strengthening partnerships with state and local stakeholders, and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources,” said Justin “J” Shirley, the principal deputy director of the U.S. The refuge may have never expanded into all of those acres, it was just plotted out where they wanted to acquire land if private landowners wanted to sell it to them.” Leahy said the expansion would have brought more hunting and fishing opportunities to the area. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement to the Tribune that the service will “take no actions to acquire lands within the acquisition boundary, seek any appropriations from Congress or submit any land acquisition proposals for approval by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for any lands within the LPP expanded acquisition boundary.” Jarid Manos, founder of the Great Plains Restoration Council, said the land, water and native wildlife in the High Plains, including prairie dogs and pronghorn antelope, are clinging to survival.

Article: ADHD drugs have wider life benefits, study suggests 20 minutes ago Share Save Philippa Roxby Health Reporter Share Save Getty Images Drug treatment can help people newly diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to reduce their risk of substance misuse, suicidal behaviour, transport accidents and criminality, a study suggests. The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of: suicidal behaviour - 17% substance misuse - 15% transport accidents - 12% criminal behaviour - 13% When recurrent events were analysed, the researchers found ADHD medication was linked to reductions of: 15% for suicide attempts 25% for substance misuses 4% for accidental injuries 16% for transport accidents 25% for criminal behaviour "Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," said Prof Samuele Cortese, study author and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at University of Southampton. "Now we have evidence they [drugs] can reduce these risks." This could be explained by medication reducing impulsive behaviour and lack of concentration, which might reduce the risk of accidents while driving and reduce aggressive behaviour which could lead to criminality.

Article: That the mainstream press wasn’t, in his view, doing an effective job of conveying the functional racism at play in the Donald Trump-backed gerrymandering effort in Texas, which is deliberately designed to target majority-Black and majority-Latino districts. Unfortunately, we have grown to the point in this country where you can use racism against people of color, but people of color can't respond and say, ‘That’s racism.’ If we do, you’re not going to print it. Just last week, Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights-averse head of the DOJ’s civil rights division, claimed during an interview that the racist gerrymandering effort in Texas isn’t truly racist but, instead, an effort to dismantle the “racial spoils” that Democrats have purportedly reaped from laws designed to combat racist gerrymandering. Abbott essentially claimed that the GOP plan couldn’t possibly be racist, because it would create additional Hispanic-majority districts, though that obviously doesn’t preclude the maps from being racist to Black people — and it’s worth noting that the new districts were were drawn specifically to favor conservative-leaning Hispanics. During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, DeSantis said he’s entitled to further gerrymander his state’s congressional map because then-President Barack Obama and then-Attorney General Eric Holder “gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade’s census.” That’s another lie, though Obama and Holder have advocated against gerrymandering. In reality, Florida Republicans — who controlled their state’s most recent redistricting process — drew gerrymandered maps that DeSantis pressured them to gerrymander further with a proposal from his office that diluted Black voter power. Nonetheless, the governor portrayed Florida’s map as unfairly weighted in favor of minority groups and claimed “there’s some racial gerrymandering that’s still lingering that we have to correct, per a recent Florida Supreme Court decision.” Indeed, Florida’s Republican-packed Supreme Court ruled last month that DeSantis could move forward with his gerrymandering plan, but the court also acknowledged that the plan would diminish the power of Black voters. All this to say, evidence abounds that Republicans are waging a racist assault on the American voting system — even as they wage a propaganda campaign to present this push as something else entirely.

Article: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones could soon be forced to stop airing his Infowars show and give up the company's property, including everything from desks and microphones to the Infowars brand name. A state judge in Texas Wednesday ordered Infowars' assets to be turned over to a newly-appointed state receiver, who will sell them to pay the families of the Connecticut children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The move paves the way for the receiver — or sheriffs — to start the process of seizing cash and property owned by Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, within days. The families, who've spent some three years in federal bankruptcy court trying to collect what Jones owes them, could start seeing their first payouts through the state court in weeks or months. Sponsor Message "The families are pleased that the court has placed InfoWars parent company into receivership, which will finally lead to accountability for Alex Jones' monstrously cruel harassment" said Mark Bankston, one of the attorneys for the families. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble's order in Travis County, Texas district court appointing a receiver, Gregory Milligan, will also be key to whether Jones gets to keep broadcasting under his Infowars brand or has to start over in some new form. toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America Most of the Sandy Hook families still want the Infowars name and property sold to the satirical site The Onion, which vowed to turn Infowars into a parody of itself. It was a win for Jones, who argued his company should have been sold to First United American Companies, which has ties to Jones and was widely expected to keep him on air. The order adds that "any Sheriff, Constable or officer of the Peace shall assist the Receiver in carrying out his duties and exercising his powers under this Order." Sponsor Message "Now that there's a receiver in place, Alex Jones is no longer going to control the Infowars brand. "It's not a panacea, but it's a more favorable venue to be in," says Larry Ponoroff, dean and professor emeritus at Tulane Law School and a professor of legal practice at Wilmington University School of Law. The Onion did not respond to requests for comment on its plans, but the company has previously vowed to continue trying to buy Infowars to ensure "a positive outcome for the horror [the Sandy Hook families] endured." There was no immediate comment from Jones' lawyers, but Jones himself railed against the judge on his show after the hearing, accusing her of overreach, and saying her order runs afoul of federal bankruptcy court orders. But because the bankruptcy judge ruled Jones' behavior "willful and malicious," the bankruptcy will not erase Jones' debt, meaning families can keep claiming any money he makes in the future until he pays the $1.3 billion he owes them. Sponsor Message The Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his companies for defamation in Connecticut and Texas in 2018, after twenty young children and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting.

Article: Tata Consultancy Services , one of the country's biggest private sector employers, announced last month that more than 12,000 staff in mostly middle and senior management roles would be cut. "Indian IT services companies exploded over the last six months and we've gradually reduced our positions and sold all of them in our portfolio," said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex Japan equity team. And for that kind of growth, valuation and yield, it doesn't make any sense to own it in Asia-Pacific where there are opportunities to buy much cheaper companies with higher yield and growth," Duhra said. India's Nifty IT Index — which comprises 10 Indian IT companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — has plunged nearly 20% so far this year, underperforming the 22.2% surge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and the 12.16% gain in the Nasdq-100 Technology Sector Index. Not a unique problem But Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M & G Investments, said the problems arising from automation that Indian tech firms face are not unique to the country. "We expect Infosys to post 3.8% y-y USD revenue growth in FY26F (including around 40 basis from acquisitions )," he said, adding that he has a buy rating at a price target of 1,880 Indian rupees ($21.47), giving it 31.86% upside potential. Bhandari also pointed out that the company added 210 staff in its fiscal first quarter ended June, which represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of around 0.1% after accounting for attrition. Coforge is Bhandari's "preferred pick" in this segment, as he forecasts it can "easily deliver around 30% revenue growth this year — multiples of what large-caps are going to do."

Article: As a wary Washington waited, the White House promised a ramp-up of National Guard troops and federal officers on the streets of the nation's capital around the clock starting Wednesday, days after President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the city's police department for at least a month. The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an "authoritarian push" at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix - even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago.

Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. She added, "It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?" Targeting a variety of infractions The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Violent crime has dropped in the district The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, "I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too." She had previously called Trump's moves "unsettling and unprecedented" while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. "It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American." ___ Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report.

Article: Jimmy Lai: Landmark trial of Hong Kong's rebel mogul resumes 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save Getty Images Lai is on trial for breaching national security and colluding with foreign forces Hailed by some as a hero and scorned by others as a traitor, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is in the final stage of his national security trial. Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. "I have a very rebellious character." He is the most prominent person charged under the controversial national security law which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. Reuters Lai is among the most prominent people charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city. Getty Images Apple Daily was unafraid to be openly critical of the Chinese state When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the "death knell" for the territory. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: "Mr President, please help us." For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.

Article: President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to streamline federal regulation governing commercial rocket launches, a move that would benefit Elon Musk's SpaceX and other private space ventures. It added: "Overly complex environmental and other licensing and permitting regulations slow down commercial space launches and infrastructure development, and benefit entrenched incumbents (who can afford to bear the expense of regulatory compliance) over new market entrants (who cannot)." Although Musk and Trump have remained embroiled in a high-profile feud for months, the billionaire entrepreneur's SpaceX rocket and satellite venture potentially stands to be the single biggest immediate beneficiary of Trump's order on Wednesday. Musk has complained that environmental impact reviews and post-flight mishap investigations have repeatedly slowed down testing of SpaceX's ambitious new Starship rocket vehicle, under development at the company's South Texas launch facility.

Article: Hot, dry summers bring new 'firewave' risk to UK cities, scientists warn 1 hour ago Share Save Justin Rowlatt • @BBCJustinR Climate Editor Share Save Getty Images A firefighter tackling a fire in east London on Tuesday Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called "firewaves" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned. The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry. "Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable," explained Professor Rein, "it becomes much more flammable." "Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire," he added. "I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed," said Prof Rein. "And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent." Managing fire risk Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible. "We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach." BBC / Kevin Church This area of Dagenham was hit by a fire earlier this year To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment. "It allows us to target our efforts where the risk to life and property is greatest." In addition to drones, the brigade has introduced off-road vehicles capable of reaching fires in difficult terrain, such as heathland and grassland.

Article: 'No surrender' from Ukraine and 'Policing minister provokes ridicule' 15 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Ukraine leads the majority of the papers on Thursday, ahead of peace talks between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. "Protect Ukraine from 'bluffing' Putin, Zelensky urges Trump" says the i Paper, after the Ukrainian president and other European leaders, who are not attending the meeting in Alaska, held a joint call with Trump on Wednesday to reiterate their position. The paper reported that European leaders have been worried that Trump "might be prepared to strike a deal on territory" without the input of Zelensky, and that the Wednesday meeting went some way to "calm their fears". After meeting with European leaders, the Guardian reports that Trump said he would push for a second meeting with Putin "almost immediately" if his Friday summit in Alaska goes well. The front page also features a story on foreign aid, with the paper reporting that ministers are considering "scrapping" a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid on projects that support gender equality. The Telegraph says that the meeting in Alaska will see Trump offer Putin access to "rare earth minerals" as an "incentive" to end the war in Ukraine, and that the US president is also prepared to lift sanctions on the Russia's aviation industry. The Times has similarly headlined with Trump's "warning to Putin on eve of talks", and allege the US and Russia have already discussed a "model" for ending the war that would "mirror Israel's occupation of the West Bank". "Fight house" reads the Daily Star's front page, as the paper reports Trump is planning to "host UFC fight bouts on the lawns of the White House" in 2026 to celebrate 250 years of America. The Express says policing minister Dame Diana Johnson "provoked ridicule" after her comments on BBC Radio 4 when she condemned shoplifters but said "stores need to play their part in making sure that items that are high value are not at the front".

The pop superstar used the appearance to announce her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and give some updates on her life since the Eras Tour, which ran almost two years and spanned five continents before ending in December. More than 1.3 million tuned in live for the programme as Swift offered insights into her relationship with Travis, the notorious easter eggs she plants in music for fans and even titbits on her sourdough-bread-baking hobby. Teaser clips of the New Heights podcast went viral before her episode aired, including one video clip where Swift unveils a briefcase with "TS" on it and pulls out her new 12th studio album, which will be available 3 October. Poking fun at male sports fans The episode begins with a screaming introduction from Jason, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, who runs through a long list of his brother's girlfriend's accomplishments, including being the only artist to win the album of the year Grammy four times. In 2023 when the pair started dating and she started making appearances, game cameras looked for the singer in the stands - cutting to her more than a dozen times during some games. Swift was booed by NFL fans during her appearance on the jumbotron screen at the Super Bowl last February, which drew headlines and even social media posts by President Donald Trump. What the cover of her new album looks like Taylor Swift announces new album during podcast As the countdown clock ran down on her website and the podcast started, Swift's website updated with the cover of her 12th studio album. Insights into how she crafts her hidden easter eggs She also spoke about all the ways she uses easter eggs to tease her music and plant hidden clues for fans. The hidden clues are "something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason, but you'll go back and be like 'Oh my God!'" She said that her favourite example was a speech she gave when she received an honourary doctorate. "I put so many lyrical easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnights album came out, after that, the fans were like, 'The whole speech was an easter egg!'" She spoke about her love of numbers and dates. Taylor gets emotional speaking about her masters In May this year, it was announced that she had bought the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running and highly publicised battle over the ownership of her music. "I want this because it was my handwritten diary entries from my entire life." She said that her mother and brother talked with with Shamrock Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, about purchasing her music. She also thanked loyal fans for listening to her re-recorded albums, saying they reacted to the dispute over rights to her music with the Western cowboy expression, "We ride at dawn". "I think a lot of the vocals I did on the re-records were better than the original," she said, adding that she is especially fond of the remake of her 2012 album Red.

Last week Trump warned there could be "some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both", leading to fears Ukraine might have to give up some areas in order to end the bloody conflict. Addressing a virtual meeting of the European leaders following the call with Trump, Sir Keir said "any ceasefire would have to be lasting and to be lasting it would need security guarantees". The coalition is a group of mainly European countries who have pledged to provide military support to Ukraine - including potentially boots on the ground - in order to deter Russia from breaching any agreed peace deal. "Now we do have that chance, because of the work the president has put in." Vance is currently on a private family holiday in the UK, and also joined the call with Sir Keir and other European leaders on Wednesday. The vice-president said the two countries had a "beautiful alliance" and that the US had "worked with our friends from the United Kingdom to achieve great victories" over the past 100 years. "When we fight together, when we make it clear that we always approach every situation with an open hand - but if things go poorly, we're willing to do what we have to do, we make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world."

"The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells." In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit," Warren said.

Article: President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon "should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ." In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle. "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost," Mericle said. UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that "the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices," while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase , said in a note that tariffs could "add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred." Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.
