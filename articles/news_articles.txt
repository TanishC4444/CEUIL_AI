Article: Who: Real Madrid vs Osasuna What: Spanish La Liga Where: Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid, Spain When: Tuesday 9pm (19:00 GMT) How to follow: We’ll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 6pm (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream of the match. The 36-time Spanish domestic champions approach the new season with several new signings and fresh hope under recently appointed coach Xabi Alonso and are looking to turn the page on a disappointing end to the Carlo Ancelotti era with “ambitious” football. But as Alonso saw firsthand in his Real managerial debut at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States this summer – Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Madrid 4-0 in the semifinal – there is plenty of work to do if the megaclub wants to reclaim its La Liga title from Barcelona in the new season. Alonso’s Vinicius-Mbappe challenge Alonso, who wants to implement some version of the 3-4-2-1 formation that won him the Bundesliga title with Bayer Leverkusen in 2023, faces a huge challenge to unlock the chemistry between his two superstar forwards: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior. Both Mbappe, who scored 44 goals in his debut season at Real, and Vinicius, whose scoring output dipped substantially after the Frenchman’s arrival, are being told they must contribute more off the ball this season and set a better example for the team, according to reporting by the Marca newspaper. If the two players again fail to consistently connect up front in the 2025-2026 season, the constant rumour mill of a Vinicius exit from the club will begin churning once more. The teams played out a controversial 1-1 draw on February 19 when 10-man Real squandered a chance to cement their lead on top of the La Liga ladder after Jude Bellingham was sent off in the 39th minute for what appeared to be an argument with the match referee. Los Blancos’ hope is for Turkish playmaker Arda Guler, who is entering his second season with the club, to be able to thrive there and become a player who can control the tempo of a game. Towering centre back Dean Huijsen joins the club from Bournemouth after signing a 50 million pounds ($67m) deal on May 17 and is also expected to line up in the starting XI. “Following tests conducted on Eduardo Camavinga by the Real Madrid Medical Services, the player has been diagnosed with a sprain to his right ankle,” the 15-time European champions wrote on their website. Possible lineups: Real Madrid possible starting XI: Courtois (GK); Alexander-Arnold, Huijsen, Militao; Carreras, Guler, Tchouameni, Ceballos; Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr; Mbappe Osasuna possible starting XI: Herrera (GK); Arnaiz, Boyomo, Catena, Cruz; Torro, Garcia; Oroz, Munoz, Gomez; Budimir Head-to-head: In their last five matches against Osasuna, Real Madrid have won four and drawn once: Osasuna 1, Real Madrid 1 – February 16, La Liga Real Madrid 4, Osasuna 0 – November 10, La Liga Osasuna 2, Real Madrid 4 – March 17, 2024, La Liga Real Madrid 4, Osasuna 0 – October 8, 2023, La Liga Real Madrid 2, Osasuna 1 – May 7, 2023, Copa del Rey final

Article: Jason Tartick says 'never say never' to being the next 'Bachelor' on this week's 'Playing The Field' You may remember Jason Tartick from his stint on "The Bachelorette" years ago. He's written two books called "Restart Roadmap Rewire and Reset Your Career" and "Talk Money to Me: The 8 Essential Financial Questions to Discuss with Your Partner." Tartick said that he's been watching this season of "Bachelor in Paradise," and he has some advice for whoever wins the show's $500,000 prize. "So for whoever does win it, I think the biggest thing is you can't decide what you are going to do with the money or how you are going to do it, or what percentage goes where until you understand everyone, and each individual's relationship with money." When it comes to whether or not he'd do reality television again, possibly being the next "Bachelor," he didn't rule it out. "I always say like, you never say never, but I will say since like I don't know what was it, like the last two years there have been five different shows that have approached me to go on and my desire to go back on reality tv is quite low right now, so never say never, but I'd prefer if I was going to go back in for it to be a competition like show but you never know," Tartick said.

Article: President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Alaska meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, U.S., August 15,2025. Friday's Alaska summit raised concerns in Europe that Trump might have softened his stance toward potential sanctions on Russia, and is now pushing for a permanent peace deal in Ukraine instead of an initial ceasefire — an approach more aligned with Moscow's position. EU officials still recall Zelenskyy's incendiary appearance in the Oval office in February, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized the Ukrainian leader in front of TV cameras for not being thankful enough for U.S. "The idea is to make sure [Trump] has the same objectives as Europe." The same diplomat outlined: "Our main objectives are: security guarantees, stop the killing and go for a trilateral meeting."

Article: RUN YTD mountain RUN YTD chart As a catalyst, Dendrinos pointed to guidance issued Friday from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits under President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline. "We believe the guidance provides longer term demand visibility and largely removes the uncertainty under Trump's EO calling for stricter Treasury guidance on enforcement of 'commence construction' rules." Furthermore, the expiration of the federal homeowner rooftop solar tax credit in December of this year could drive demand to the third-party ownership market, where a solar company owns and maintains a solar system versus the homeowner, Dendrinos said. "We believe this presents RUN with an opportunity to take share and selectively onboard additional dealers and hire others as non-TPO installers look to restructure and partner with a TPO provider." The analyst added that Sunrun's value proposition lies in its cash generation stemming from opportunities such as higher solar adoption, cost reductions in customer acquisition and higher utility power pricing.

Article: Zelenskyy brings Europe's top leaders with him to meet Trump on ending Russia's war Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings with him an extraordinary cadre of European leaders to show U.S. The European political heavy-hitters were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they are looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. By arriving as a group, they hope to avoid any debacles like Zelenskyy's February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. The meeting also is a test of America's relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump's tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. Monday's showing is a sign both of the progress and the possible distress coming out of the Alaska meeting as many of Europe's leaders are descending on Washington with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine's interests, a rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!" Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, "We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably." He went on to say that "peace must be lasting," not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and "Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack." The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. and European countries Ukraine will be able to force Russia to "true peace." European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in America's capital are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The president also bemoaned media coverage of his summit with Putin, saying on Truth Social: "I had a great meeting in Alaska." Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that "the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." 'A very big move' European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. "How that's constructed, what we call it, how it's built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that's what we'll be talking about over the next few days with our partners who are coming in from overseas," Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press." Rubio said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that such a commitment "would be a very big move" by Trump. Ahead of Monday's meeting, France's Macron stressed the importance of building up Ukraine's military and the need to show Putin that Europe interprets his moves as a threat to other nations. "If we are weak with Russia today, we'll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and - make no mistake - they can impact us, too," Macron said. Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched a total of four Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 140 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight, of which 88 drones were intercepted or jammed.

Trump expanded his winning coalition two years later, in part with promises to prevent the rest of America from becoming like the cities he called “unlivable, unsanitary nightmares,” deriding the data that showed improvement across the country. While his tactics in Washington, D.C., are extraordinary, the effort is an actualization of one of his most tried-and-true political arguments: Democrats — often Black Democrats — have let lawlessness run rampant in the cities and states they were elected to run.

Article: Martin Barraud | OJO Images | Getty Images The so-called "great resignation" has become the "great stay." But experts say workers aren't just staying — they're "job hugging." Job hugging is the act of holding onto a job "for dear life," consultants at Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm, wrote this week. "There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low," said Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. "There's just not a lot of movement at all." 'Uncertainty in the world' The rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs has lingered near lows unseen since around 2016, outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic. "There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.

Article: And the system has been rigged for as long as I remember, but it’s clearly gotten worse.” In a video accompanying his campaign launch, Brown lays out three principles important to him: “standing up for workers, treating everyone with dignity and respect, working as hard as possible.” “I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,” Brown says in the video. “That’s why I’m running for Senate.” Brown, 72, lost his race for a fourth term last year to Republican Bernie Moreno by about 3.5 percentage points as President Donald Trump carried Ohio by 11 points. Word of his decision to run for Senate — and not for governor, as many Ohio Democrats had been hoping — trickled out last week, reported first by Cleveland.com and confirmed by NBC News. “I really, legitimately, don’t know.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had aggressively lobbied Brown to choose a Senate bid over a run for governor and traveled twice to Ohio to persuade him to take on Husted. The move, which placed Brown and Schultz closer to their grandchildren and to Schultz’s teaching job at Denison University, nonetheless fueled chatter that he was leaning more toward a run for governor. I could have gone either way in that case, but I just think I can have more impact in the Senate.” Brown singled out Husted’s vote for the Trump-backed “big, beautiful bill,” a megabill that has come under fire for its cuts to Medicaid and other federal safety net programs. “By any measure, this is the worst vote he’s cast in the Senate, but it’s a continuum of his running for special interests his whole career.” Husted, 57, like Brown, has spent much of his adult life in public office.

Article: Air Canada suspends restart plans after flight attendants union defies return to work order Air Canada suspended plans to restart operations after the union representing 10,000 flight attendants said it will defy a return to work order. Air Canada said in a statement that the union "illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board." "Our members are not going back to work," Canadian Union of Public Employees national president Mark Hancock said outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job,)Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada's prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full "due to the summer travel peak." Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said "would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada." But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.

Today’s meeting is an important opportunity for the leaders to discuss two major sticking points: security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future invasions and the status of Ukrainian land desired by Putin. In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump appeared to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, while emphasizing that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and its hopes of joining NATO — a key demand from Putin.

Article: Three Republican-led states to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital. Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention. The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. National Guard members are coming from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio The Republican governors of the three states said they were sending hundreds of troops at the request of the Trump administration. Patrick Morrisey said he directed 300 to 400 Guard troops to head to Washington, adding that the state "is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital." South Carolina Gov. Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police from the Guard to "carry out presence patrols and serve as added security" and that they were expected to arrive in the coming days. Protest pushes back on federal crackdown in Washington A protest against Trump's intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, "No fascist takeover of D.C.," and some in the crowd held signs saying, "No military occupation." Morgan Taylor, one of the protest organizers, said they were hoping to spark enough backlash to Trump's actions that the administration would be forced to pull back on its crime and immigration agenda. "I can't believe that this is happening in this country at this time." Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreaching and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. "Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities," Finnigan said. Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was "very uncomfortable and worried" for the safety or her students given the "unmarked officers of all types" now roaming Washington and detaining people. Dickstein said she turned out to the protest with friends and relatives to "prevent a continuous domino effect going forward with other cities." Surge of federal law enforcement in Washington draws mixed reactions Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an "emergency police commissioner" after the district's top lawyer sued.

He said that impeded the "federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence."

She added that if Washington residents stick together, "we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy - even when we don't have full access to it."

Today’s meeting is an important opportunity for the leaders to discuss two major sticking points: security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future invasions and the status of Ukrainian land desired by Putin. In a post to Truth Social Sunday night, Trump appeared to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, while emphasizing that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and its hopes of joining NATO — a key demand from Putin. More on the war in Ukraine: Despite Trump’s new goal of a peace agreement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that a ceasefire was “not off the table,” though Russia has not agreed to stop fighting. He also said there “have to be some security guarantees for Ukraine.” Police search for multiple gunmen after 3 people killed in shooting at Brooklyn club A view of the crime scene where three people were killed and eight other people are injured in a mass shooting inside of Taste of the City Bar and Lounge on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York, on Aug.

Article: What each side wants from Ukraine talks at White House 28 minutes ago Share Save Laura Gozzi and Tom Geoghegan BBC News Share Save AFP via Getty Images It promises to be a day unlike any other at the White House later, when world leaders make a rare collective visit for crunch talks on Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the EU and Nato have dashed across the Atlantic to have their say on how the three-year-old war with Russia should end and on what terms. Since meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Trump appears to have ditched his criticism of Moscow and the threat of sanctions, and decided to pile the pressure on Zelensky instead. Follow live updates Whirlwind day of talks could reshape Ukraine's future In a late Sunday night social post, he warned the Ukrainian president he must forgo hopes of Nato membership and will have to concede Crimea, which Putin illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine - refuse concessions on territory Zelensky finds himself in the unenviable position of having to stand his ground in the face of an increasingly impatient Donald Trump, who appears to have been swayed by Putin and who has already accused Zelensky of standing in the way of peace. This will be extraordinarily difficult for the Ukrainian president to give in to as it would entail retreating from Donetsk and Luhansk, regions which thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have fought and died to protect since 2022. The vagueness of US statements on the matter is alarming to Europeans who feel protection from potential future attacks by Russia will have to come from a credible American commitment. Last week, a virtual US-EU meeting ahead of the Alaska summit seemed to have the effect of hardening Trump's criticism of Russia; now that he is appearing to be teetering on Moscow's side again, European leaders will try to impress on him that their concerns about the continent's long-term security have not changed.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: US special envoy Tom Barrack has asked Israel to withdraw from the Lebanese territory after Beirut approved a plan to disarm the Hezbollah group by the end of the year, in exchange for an end to Israeli military attacks on its territory. The US-backed plan sets out a four-phase roadmap for the Hezbollah group to hand in their arsenal as Israel’s military halts ground, air and sea operations and withdraws troops from Lebanon’s south. Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan on August 7 despite Hezbollah’s outright refusal to disarm, raising fears that Israel could intensify attacks on Lebanon, even while it carries out near-daily violations of the November truce it signed with Hezbollah to end its war. Barrack described the cabinet’s decision as a “Lebanese decision that requires Israel’s cooperation” and said the US was “in the process of now discussing with Israel what their position is” but provided no further details. ‘An economic proposal’ The US envoy also said Washington would seek an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in the country, after months of shuttle diplomacy between the US and Lebanon. I believe we will witness progress in several areas in the coming weeks.” “This is the first visit of the American envoy to Lebanon after the Lebanese cabinet mandated the Lebanese army to assess how to disarm Hezbollah,” said Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Beirut. “However, there are a lot of concerns with respect to how this process is going to happen, given the fact that Hezbollah refused.” On Friday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem raised the spectre of civil war, warning there would be “no life” in Lebanon should the state attempt to confront or eliminate the group. Under phase one of the US-backed plan, the Lebanese government is to issue a decision committing to Hezbollah’s full disarmament by the end of the year – which it now has – and Israel will cease military operations in Lebanese territory. In phase three, which should happen within 90 days of that, Israel is to withdraw from the last two of the five disputed border positions, and money would be secured for Lebanon’s reconstruction. Advertisement Just on Monday, Israeli attacks blew up a house in the town of Meiss el-Jabal, a sound bomb went off in the border town of Dahra, and drones could be overheard in the towns of Wadi Zefta, al-Numairiyeh and Wadi Kafra, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.

Article: After a summit in Alaska on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, Trump suggested on Sunday that a peace agreement could come quickly if Zelenskyy cedes eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region to Russia. Zelenskyy will be joined in Washington, DC, by several European leaders who will be there to support Ukraine’s position and push for its direct involvement in any peace deal and for that deal to be backed by US security guarantees. In addition to Trump, confirmed participants at Monday’s meeting are: Finnish President Alexander Stubb French President Emmanuel Macron German Chancellor Friedrich Merz Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte What are they going to discuss? On Sunday, special Trump envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Putin had agreed for the US and Europe to provide future security protections to Ukraine, similar to NATO’s Article 5 self-defence pact. Von der Leyen welcomed the proposal of NATO-style security guarantees from the US, noting that the “coalition of the willing, including the European Union, is ready to do its share”. On the matter of ceding Ukrainian land to Russia, Zelenskyy appeared to push back against the idea in a post on X in which he described Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and subsequent invasion of eastern Ukraine as a cautionary tale. Zelenskyy wrote that today’s situation is “not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East – part of Donbas – and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Brussels has fretted about Ukraine giving up land and its repercussions for Europe – namely about the potential for Russia to try to expand its borders beyond Ukraine. Since meeting Putin in Alaska, Trump has increased pressure on Ukraine to accept an agreement to end Russia’s war, claiming that Zelenskyy could choose to end the conflict “almost immediately”. Trump’s remarks may spark alarm among European diplomats eager to avoid a repeat of Zelenskyy’s public humiliation during his last visit to the White House in February when Trump and US Vice President JD Vance accused him of ingratitude and disrespect. As mentioned, the Alaska summit ended with no peace deal, and no arrangements were made for follow-up, working-level meetings, which would have been expected if any agreements had been reached in principle. According to sources close to the matter who spoke to the Reuters news agency, Russia has suggested giving up small pockets of Ukrainian land in return for Ukraine giving it stretches of land in its east.

Article: Volodymyr Zelenskyy will bring heavyweight reinforcements to the White House on Monday — a troop of European leaders likely hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office showdown at a moment of even greater stakes for his country and the continent. Trump accused a waspish Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War 3,” and of disrespecting the White House as the cameras rolled, before cutting the meeting short and telling the Ukrainian leader to come back “when he is ready for peace.” Zelenskyy was in Brussels over the weekend before arriving in Washington as European leaders scrambled to respond to Trump's changing stance. Simon Wohlfahrt / AFP via Getty Images He returns Monday flanked by leaders from Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Finland, plus the heads of the European Union and NATO — a show of solidarity and an effort to ensure Europe has a real voice in peace talks after being excluded from Trump’s summit with Putin in Alaska. "It’s a demonstration of European unity and support to Ukraine precisely to avoid what happened in February repeating itself," Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group, told NBC News. He added that the European side would be "eager to prevent Zelenskyy being bullied into making concessions,” after Trump fueled new alarm among Ukraine's allies by appearing to lean toward the Kremlin’s view of things following his talks with Putin. Trump put the onus on Zelenskyy, saying he could “end the war almost immediately, if he wants to,” and that there was “no going into Nato by Ukraine” and “no getting back” the Crimean Peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images This public pressure has fueled fears that he could turn up the heat on Zelenskyy to agree to territorial concessions in exchange for a peace deal. Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals told NBC News. Rahman said the nature of the security guarantees was "absolutely key to prevent Russian aggression in the future," saying the Europeans would travel to Washington hoping to "pin down the detail of what U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s future security will be." Citing a deadly strikes in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, Zelenskyy said Monday that Russia was continuing its attacks on his country even as talks were ongoing in order “to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts.” And in Kyiv, many feel that conceding territory as part of the broader peace deal Trump is now pursuing wouldn’t end the war at all — it would only embolden Moscow to push further. "It is precisely this so-called long-term peace of Putin’s that would allow him to continue waging war," said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a lawmaker for Ukrainian opposition party "European Solidarity." "The quickest step is to establish a ceasefire first, and only then begin negotiations." Europe’s leaders appear to share that instinct. “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday.

"It was exactly 09:00 when I had a last glance at the stream and sensed it was going to burst its banks due to continuing rains," Saeed Ahmad, 59, told Anadolu news agency. Mr Ahmad ordered an immediate evacuation, and within 15 minutes all teachers and children had left - moments before raging floodwaters surged through the school, washing away half the building, its boundary walls and playground.

Article: Those who didn't play Fifa had no idea why Medvedev fell to the court, on his side like a dead fish, when he beat Novak Djokovic in their 2021 US Open final. It is also why many fans will be rooting for the 29-year-old Russian at this year's US Open as he looks to get through one of the most testing periods of his career. With many athletes reluctant to show too much personality - although that has started to change in the social media era - Medvedev is seen as a breath of fresh air. "Being myself is the easiest way to be because if you try to act - or over-act - people will see through it and you will lose yourself." Earlier this year he was surprised by the ATP Tour presenting him with a book of positive comments from fans on social media.

Article: In a post on Truth Social Friday morning, the president claimed that the people protesting his decision to leverage hundreds of National Guards members to combat a seemingly unfounded rise in crime were actually paid Democratic agents. Indeed, a couple of months ago, amid protests in the Los Angeles area, Trump railed against “paid insurrectionists,” “professional agitators” and “paid troublemakers” As regular readers might recall, it’s been one of his go-to claims for a long while. Trump assured the public once more that these Americans deserved to be ignored — because, he assumed, they were “paid protesters.” The following year, Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination inspired another round of progressive activism. The protesters, Trump insisted, were “paid professionals.” Earlier this year, as congressional Republicans faced public backlashes at local events, the president assured the public: “Paid ‘troublemakers’ are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Russia’s Vladimir Putin has embraced the same tactic. Let’s instead consider the unavoidable bottom line: For Trump and too many in his party, Americans who disagree with them are effectively an impossibility that can only be explained through corrupt schemes and illicit payments. It’s hardly a stretch to draw a straight line from “paid protesters” rhetoric to election denialism: Americans who side with Trump and Republicans are real, while Americans who disagree must necessarily be seen as inauthentic. Whether the president is prepared to accept this or not, the fact remains that Americans who take to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with him, as happened again over the weekend, don’t need to be compensated: Their outrage is sincere.

"This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation." While MSNBC and NBC News will have duplications in coverage, such as covering politics, CNBC's news organization is already separate enough from NBC News that executives decided it didn't need a name change, according to people familiar with the matter. MSNBC will soon kick off a national marketing campaign to accompany the launch of the new name, "unlike anything we have done in recent memory," Kutler noted in her memo Monday.

Article: "Lilly doing this isn't shocking and I think that we'll see more to come," Kavita Patel, NBC News & MSNBC medical contributor and Stanford University professor, told CNBC's "Fast Money" on Thursday. President Trump earlier this month delivered an ultimatum to pharma firms as part of his ongoing campaign to stamp out what he deems as unfair pricing practices in the U.S. list price of its popular treatment from a range of £92 (about $124.57) to £122 a month, depending on the dose size, to between £133 and £330 — a 170% price jump. Several European pharma firms have spoken out in support of the White House's pricing demands, with AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot saying last month that Trump was "right" to push for price equalization. Stanford University's Patel noted that firms like Eli Lilly may also be willing to accede to Trump's pricing demands as they seek coverage for their weight loss drugs under forthcoming changes to the U.S. Novo Nordisk 's Chief Financial Officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said earlier this month that Trump's drug pricing demands had "resonated" with the company and that it was already lowering the price of its Wegovy and Ozempic treatments stateside. markets, there's rather limited history in terms of raising prices … I believe it will be challenging to significantly raise prices outside the U.S.," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." Industry bodies, meanwhile, have warned of the damaging impact sudden prices hikes could have on patient care if implemented to meet Trump's Sept. "Short notice changes to pricing for medicines such as this also have a serious effect on access to an important public health service and pharmacy business themselves," Henry Gregg, chief executive of the U.K.'s National Pharmacy Association, said in a statement.

Article: Google has agreed to pay 55 million Australian dollars ($ 35.8m) in fines after the country’s consumer watchdog found it harmed competition by paying the country’s two largest telecommunications companies to pre-install its search application on Android phones, excluding rival search engines. The fine extends a bumpy period for the Alphabet-owned internet giant in Australia, where last week a court mostly ruled against it in a lawsuit brought by Fortnite maker Epic Games, accusing Google and Apple of preventing rival application stores in their operating systems. On anti-competitive tie-ups with Australian telcos, the country’s consumer watchdog on Monday said Google struck deals with Telstra and Optus, under which the tech giant shared with them advertising revenue generated from Google Search on Android devices between late 2019 and early 2021. Google admitted the arrangement had a substantial effect on competition from rival search engines, and has stopped signing similar deals while also agreeing to the fine, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) added. “Today’s outcome … created the potential for millions of Australians to have greater search choice in the future, and for competing search providers to gain meaningful exposure to Australian consumers,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. “We are committed to providing Android device makers more flexibility to pre-load browsers and search apps, while preserving the offerings and features that help them innovate, compete with Apple, and keep costs low,” the spokesperson added.

In the middle, President Donald Trump has often been accused of siding with the latter, suggesting that Russia should keep Crimea as part of a deal he once said would take 24 hours to knock together but has in reality proved far harder. “But it’s not just that somebody was baptized there, or that it was the origin of Russian spirituality,” said Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at London’s Chatham House think tank. “Crimea is a military asset for Russia.” Indeed, Putin himself has described the peninsula as Russia’s “unsinkable aircraft carrier” — turning this erstwhile tourist haven into a garrison of fighter jets and missiles with which to attack Ukraine. It also allowed him to harbor his formidable Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city, and less than 200 miles from both Romania and Turkey, two key NATO members and allies of Washington in the region.

Article: To the extent that Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin was about ending the war in Ukraine, the talks in Alaska were a fiasco for the United States: The Russian leader flew home after scoring a series of easy victories, leading to “pronounced gloating” in Moscow in the wake of Trump’s failure. But it’d be an overstatement to suggest that the American president walked away completely empty-handed: Trump didn’t end the fighting, but he picked up some praise from Putin about the Republican’s own domestic political fights. In his post-summit interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, for example, the Republican declared, “Vladimir said just a little while ago, he said, ‘I’ve never seen anybody do so much so fast.’ He said, ‘Your country is like hot as a pistol.’ And a year ago, he thought it was dead.” Trump similarly cited Putin when attacking mail-in voting — because if there’s one person an American leader should turn to as an authoritative voice on election administration, it’s an unelected foreign dictator. NBC News reported: Putin thanked Trump for the bilateral meeting this afternoon, and said that Trump was correct in saying that his war with Ukraine would not have begun had he been president in 2022 when the war got underway. The Russian leader specifically said, in reference to one of his American counterpart’s claims, “I can confirm it.” Trump, naturally, added soon after that this made him “very happy.” While that reaction is hardly surprising, it’s worth appreciating just how little sense the exchange made. But that was less of a boast than he probably realized: John Bolton, Trump’s former White House national security advisor, was among many observers who noted that Putin was unlikely to launch a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country during Trump’s tenure because at that point, he already had a White House giving Moscow everything it wanted — and there was no reason to upset that balance with an unnecessary war. But complicating matters further, at the heart of the claim is a dubious assumption: Trump would have the world believe that Putin was so impressed with the awesomeness of Trump’s awesomeness that he wouldn’t have dared to do anything provocative with President Goliath in the White House. Indeed, in Alaska, Trump vouched for Putin’s interest in “peace,” which was soon followed by Russia launching a new round of ballistic missiles and attack drones against Ukraine, killing at least seven people in Kharkiv.

Greece’s conservative government last month suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week. It also marked a further hardening of Greece’s stance towards refugees and migrants under Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s government, which has built a fence at its northern land borders and boosted sea patrols since it came to power in 2019.

Article: WASHINGTON — Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. And the peace must be lasting." European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in Washington are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that “the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." 'A very big move' European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched a total of four Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 140 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine overnight, of which 88 drones were intercepted or jammed.

Article: And it's not medical toggle caption Svetlana Repnitskaya/Getty Images/Moment RF To save the lives of infants and small children living in low- and middle-income countries, there are a handful of tried and tested tools, like anti-malarial drugs, bed nets and vaccines. Infants born to people who received $1,000, no-strings-attached, were nearly half as likely to die as infants born to people who got no cash, according to a report published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Sponsor Message "This paper is really well done, and the result itself is pretty stunning," says Heath Henderson , an economist at Drake University who wasn't involved in the study. "Infant and child mortality in rural Kenya is an order of magnitude higher than it is in the U.S.," says Edward Miguel , an economist at the University of California Berkeley and study co-author. Statistically speaking, that means we need a really large sample size to have precise and reliable estimates of the effect of cash on child mortality." Sponsor Message $1,000 to 10,000 families In 2014, the nonprofit GiveDirectly began a massive experiment. "When I worked in rural parts of Uganda, one of the things that was really clear for pregnant women was they did not attend antenatal care, because it's so difficult to get to a health care facility," says Miriam Laker-Oketta , GiveDirectly's senior research adviser. "You're making the decision between, should I go for antenatal care and have my family sleep hungry, or should I stay home and hope that my baby is fine because I'm not feeling sick and we can have a meal that day," she says, since often women would have to forgo work for a day to go to the doctor. "Those are some of the decisions people have to make." Sponsor Message Extra cash seems to make those decisions easier, as long as health care facilities weren't too far away. "We've given people the means to access the care that they need and not to make some of these really difficult choices between getting care and feeding a family." The extra cash also helped put more food on the table. Women who got cash while pregnant also worked about half as much — roughly 21 fewer hours per week — in their first trimester and the months after delivery than women who didn't get cash. "She's also available after the baby is born to take the child to any early health visits." A 'very important' data point Altogether, the results impressed Aaron Richterman , a physician who studies poverty reduction at the University of Pennsylvania and wasn't involved in the study. Sponsor Message Just how big a difference cash could make may depend, in part, on how readily people in other locations can use the extra money to get health care. "I think this paper underscores the point that it's really adequate access to health care that's making all the difference," said Henderson, the Drake economist and author of the book Poor Relief : Why Giving People Money Is Not The Answer To Global Poverty. "It just so happens that in this particular place, people needed cash to access health care." That's likely the case in many places across sub-Saharan Africa after years of investment in bolstering health care systems, says Laker-Oketta, but not all.

Article: As the next quarterly earnings release approaches, many of the points we made then remain true now, so I encourage a review of that prior article, but because we provided a trade example then, it makes sense to review: how it performed some trade maintenance "best practices" what to do now If you do not review the prior article, this was the trade structure we laid out three months ago: Buy 1 Sept 19 110 call ($5.73 premium) Sell 1 June 27 115 call ($1.51 premium) Sell 1 June 27 84 put ($1.49 premium) That entire structure required an outlay of ~$2.73 in premium. One notices that the calendar spread, which was long the Sep 110 calls and short a nearer-dated June 27 expiration strangle, saw its value increase within the first couple of weeks. Consider that the most a trader could expect to make over the 16 days remaining in the short strangle was just 47 cents, or less than half of 1% of the stock price. As it happens, the strangle did indeed expire worthless, and the only remaining component of the trade, the long September calls are still worth more than the initial structure cost making the trade profitable even if one did nothing. However, one would have done far better by actively managing the trade by rolling the short options, to a longer-dated 16 delta (sometimes abbreviated 16^) strangle such as the July 25 expiration 90/115. That trade had roughly 45 days to expiration and would have collected about $2.43, net of the 47 cents one would have to pay to cover the prior short strangle that would have brought in $1.98 in additional premium. Within the next 18 days, the new short July 25 90/115 strangle would be worth only 46 cents, also having decayed by more than 80% of the value when the trade was initiated, at which point a trader could have rolled the short strangle yet again. The chart below illustrates the difference in the P & L of buying the spread with a "set and forget," versus managing the trade by rolling the short strangles once they have lost more than 80% of their value. In this example, I simply suggest that if you sell a 16 delta (16^) strangle, you roll it once it has decayed by 80%, identifying a new short option of ~16^ with 6-7 weeks until expiration to replace it. 26 weekly 90 puts at $1.38 If the short strangle loses 80% or more of its value, roll the options out to expirations of six weeks or so, selecting strikes of 16-20^. For me, the rule of thumb is 12% annualized, or 1% a month or more, particularly if the underlying stock is highly volatile, is in a volatile industry, or has a lot of debt.

Article: Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani has held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to discuss a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as Israel intensifies its offensive to seize Gaza City. “El-Sisi and the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar stressed the importance of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza,” according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency on Monday. The two leaders “affirmed their rejection of the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of Palestinians”, as Israel plans to seize Gaza City and force Palestinians from the enclave’s main urban centre. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been mediating between Israel and Hamas since the beginning of the war in Gaza that has killed 62,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Efforts by mediators have so far failed to secure a lasting ceasefire in the ongoing war, which over more than 22 months has created a dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said that Qatar’s prime minister was visiting “to consolidate our existing common efforts in order to apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible”. Alluding to the dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip, where United Nations agencies and aid groups have warned of a humanitarian crisis, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching an agreement. ‘Genocides don’t end through negotiated solutions’ Commenting on the Qatari prime minister’s trip to Egypt, Abdullah Al-Arian, an associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar, said it was important to remember that similar negotiations have occurred before, but it is “a lack of Israeli political will” that has ultimately stalled them. Israel “has continued to pursue this genocide and taking it to new, horrific, unprecedented levels”, he told Al Jazeera, adding that there has been a lack of international pressure to secure a ceasefire agreement. “Historically, genocides don’t end through negotiated solutions … They end usually because the party that committed the genocide is forced to end it, usually through external pressure, external intervention of some kind, and that has not happened yet,” the academic stressed. On Monday, human rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza as the UN and aid groups continued to warn of famine in the Palestinian enclave. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” The UN and the international community have been slamming Israel for blocking necessary aid from entering the war-torn enclave.

For more than a decade, the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine — of which Kramatorsk is one of the largest cities still holding out — has been the focal point of intense battles and diplomatic disputes. Pierre Crom / Getty Images For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots. For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force. After Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations. Russia’s conditions to end the war include Ukraine ceding the territories Putin claims — roughly 20% of the country — and agreeing to permanent neutrality, including a ban on joining NATO. While Ukraine is deeply fatigued by the war, about 75% of Ukrainians also object to formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.

Article: Won't stop': Documentary filmmakers face federal funding shortfall toggle caption Stacey Holman/PBS The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has helped make PBS a home for independent documentaries for more than 50 years. The government's decision to rescind CPB's entire $1.1 billion budget in July, subsequently causing it to announce its closure, led last week to PBS's announcement that it would be reducing its budget by 21%. This on top of sweeping grant cancellations earlier this year at both the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts, which both served as important sources of federal funding for documentarians. Won't stop," said filmmaker Carol Bash, whose 2015 documentary about jazz musician Mary Lou Williams, Mary Lou Williams: The Lady Who Swings the Band, was made with public media support. " We're going to continue to find ways to think outside the box to get our films out there to audiences." Sponsor Message Bash said her community is now trying to figure out how to make up for the funding shortfall. (Popular creators can earn revenue through such mechanisms as YouTube's Partner Program and brand deals.) Streaming platform Tubi does occasionally produce or co-produce documentaries, such as When Black Women Go Missing, a 2024 co-production with Vice about the disproportionately high number of Black, female missing persons. "For many documentarians, if you say, 'Are you looking to recoup your investment, or do you want your story to be seen by as many people as possible?' The answer is always both. But ultimately they'll lean toward, 'We just want our content to be seen.'" Sponsor Message The challenges of the open marketplace Indie documentary insiders said it's tough for most indie films to gain visibility in the profit-driven streaming marketplace because they aren't necessarily made for mass audiences. Lozano expects roughly 10 films to lose out on funding this year — a big cut from the up to 40 feature and short documentaries the group typically supports annually. It's an equity issue as much as an artistic one." But for people like Mike Gonzalez, who've fought for decades to stop the flow of federal dollars into public media, there's no reason why these films should get special treatment in the form of federal dollars. A senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, Gonzalez told NPR that PBS — and NPR — needed to be defunded at the federal level owing to "the very biased programming" — a claim both networks' leaders reject. "I don't want to suppress views that are opposite to my own in the least," Gonzalez said, adding that it's simply a matter of independent documentaries vying for eyeballs just like everything else in the content universe. "Maybe this is the opportunity to create a much larger fund specifically for Black stories that is not hampered by the whims of the political movement at the time," said Leslie Fields-Cruz, the executive director of Black Public Media. " IDA is trying to pursue more strategic litigation to see how we can get the support to challenge some of the actions that have been taken at the federal level," said Dominic Willsdon, the IDA's executive director. Sponsor Message " Removing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting out of the media landscape means the world becomes much more impoverished, and the stories that get told will be much more anodyne," said Robb Moss, a documentary filmmaker and professor in Harvard University's department of art, film and visual studies.

Article: But according to Frédérique Carrier, head of investment strategy for RBC Wealth Management in the British Isles and Asia, one pocket of the European market remains overlooked by international investors. "Most of our wealth clients who enquire about Europe have France and Germany in mind, and perhaps Italy and Spain, but few think of the Nordics where macroeconomic trends are encouraging," she said. Pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Zealand Pharma have each shed around 48% so far this year, amid threats from Trump to slap tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical goods. "Denmark is widely seen as a resilient economy, thanks to its low level of indebtedness at the national level (debt to GDP a mere 28% while it enjoys a fiscal surplus of close to 4% of GDP), even as its pharmaceutical sector — which has largely driven growth in the past — is currently in the cross hairs of President Trump's new tariffs strategy," she said in an email. She noted that equity investors looking to allocate to European stocks should take "a highly selective approach to investment." "Our focus would be on high quality companies with a strong business model, a broad international revenue base and robust cash flow generation, an area where the Nordics are particularly well represented," she said. "Such quality does not necessarily come cheap and investors might want to wait for an opportunistic price correction before building positions." 'Unmatched advantage' The Nordic region is rich with opportunities in emerging industries, according to Tor Langøy, founder of London-based investment advisory BD Globe Capital Partners and Viking Digital Campus, a hydro-powered digital corporate campus on Norway's west coast. Brookfield Asset Management, which manages assets worth more than $1 trillion, announced in June it would allocate up to 95 billion Swedish krona ($10 billion) to support the development of AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced at the end of July that it would spearhead a multibillion-dollar data center project in Norway that would deliver 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units by the end of 2026. "[It boasts the] lowest electricity costs in Europe, powered by 100% renewable hydropower, accelerated grid connection timelines, enabling faster go-to-market, [and] supportive, pro–data center government policies that welcome strategic infrastructure investment." He argued that Norway will "continue to lead" thanks to its energy security, connectivity resilience and geopolitical stability. "As the world leader in mobile network technology, Ericsson is well positioned to capitalize on its strong market positions and find new growth avenues over time," AB Investor's President and CEO Christian Cederholm, said in the firm's second-quarter earnings report. "While we operate in an unpredictable world, I remain confident in Investor's and our companies' ability to generate attractive long-term total returns." Cederholm later told CNBC that there were also opportunities in the Nordic region's private markets. "So we're not bargain hunters, we're in this for the long term … on the positive side, I would say that between our focus markets, which are the Nordics and North America, there are a really good investment opportunities." — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

Article: The brigades were called in by Ayad Kadhim Ali after he was dismissed as the head of the ministry’s office in Baghdad’s Karkh district, according to Mehmet Alaca, an expert on Iraq’s Shia militias. Proponents of the bill argue it would incentivise the PMF to act within the confines of the law, but detractors fear it would give legal cover to militias, which are already too strong. The group received Iranian support to become a major powerbroker in Iraq and later intervened in Syria’s civil war to support then-President Bashar al-Assad as he tried to crush a popular rebellion. Advertisement Kataib Imam Ali is another, albeit smaller, group in the PMF that reportedly received training from the Lebanese group Hezbollah in Iran and also dispatched fighters to Syria during the height of its war. Like Kataib Imam Ali, most PMF factions were formed after Iraqi Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani issued a fatwa in 2014, urging all able-bodied men to join the state to defend Iraq from ISIL (ISIS). But the law lacks clarity around command and control and budgetary oversight, and it has failed to prevent some groups from taking unilateral action to attack United States assets and soldiers stationed in the country. While the figure is small relative to the $21.1bn allocated to Iraq’s Ministry of Defence that same year, it is a sizeable amount that the state allocated to a body that it did not even have an accurate membership list for. Over the past 10 years, PMF factions have created political wings, run in parliamentary elections and gained access to lucrative state money after securing important administrative positions in key ministries. In 2021, PMF groups linked to Iran launched a drone at the home of then-Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, reportedly an attempt to upend the government after losing many parliamentary seats and thus access to state money in the recent elections, said Alaca, the expert on Iraqi Shia militias. It would give all PMF factions official, stable employment and bring them under the control of Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani as commander-in-chief Proponents of the draft law mainly include a bloc of five Shia parties known as the Coordination Framework. “The argument pushed by those advocating for the law is that by offering an institutional safe haven for armed factions under a reformed PMF, it would incentivise those to comply with the national chain of command – thereby diminishing their appetite to take action outside the state,” explained Inna Rudolf, an expert on the PMF and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Statecraft & National Security at King’s College London. During the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, PMF groups did not attack US assets or personnel, likely out of fear of giving Israel a pretext to attack their command structure and resources as Israel did against Hezbollah, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute. “I would say that the stronger and more embedded PMF groups are the ones who have been practising restraint and telling the smaller [pro-Iran] factions not to get involved in the regional conflict [between Iran and Israel],” Mansour said. The follow-up on the Ministry of Agriculture incident will test the willingness of PMF commanders to cooperate with the state to hold their own members accountable, as well as the state’s seriousness in holding PMF members accountable, according to Rudolf. “Sudani’s administration wants to demonstrate power over the PMF and [to prove] that everyone affiliated with it not only has the same privileges as members of the security forces but has to abide by the same code of conduct,” Rudolf told Al Jazeera. As a result, civil society is wary of seeing all PMF factions given the same privileges as Iraq’s army and police and would prefer the government absorb only those that do not have close ties with Iran, al-Kinani said. Advertisement US officials are also pressuring Iraq not to pass the law with Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly telling al-Sudani the law would “institutionalise Iranian influence and armed terrorist groups undermining Iraq’s sovereignty”.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers said they had returned to the state Monday after a two-week absence that temporarily blocked Republican leaders from enacting a plan aimed at padding their party's majority in the U.S. The legislators decided to end their standoff after they prevented Texas Republicans from passing a redrawn congressional map during a first special legislative session and after California Democrats countered with their own redistricting proposal. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu said in a statement. Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying Republicans pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday. The issue became a national rallying cry for Democrats, amid their argument that President Donald Trump and national Republicans were pursuing a power grab to insulate themselves from potential political peril in next year's midterm elections. But Democrats have been fiercely critical of those accusations, arguing the Legislature could have dispatched with bipartisan flood relief first, and only waited to hold the issue as hostage to compel Democrats to return. During Friday morning's final meeting of the first special House session, the House had 95 of the 100 members necessary to move forward, meaning that it would take the return of a only few Democrats to allow the House to go back into session.

Article: President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss how to end Russia’s three-year war in Ukraine. After that summit, Trump abandoned the requirement of reaching a ceasefire in order to hold further talks and aligned with Putin’s position that negotiations should focus on a long-term settlement instead. WATCH: Trump meets Putin in Alaska with future of Ukraine war hanging in balance The presence of several European leaders at the talks in Washington shows how central the conflict — and any settlement — is to wider security questions on the continent. They are looking to safeguard Ukraine and Europe more broadly from any further aggression from Moscow — but also are providing a show of support for Zelenskyy after his last visit to the White House led to an angry confrontation. On “Trump’s ultimate policy towards the Russia-Ukraine war hangs not just the future of Ukraine security, but Europe’s as well,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. A lot of issues need to be resolved, however, and the two sides have previously established red lines that are incompatible, including questions of whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine’s army and whether the country will have any guarantee against further Russian aggression. Putin wants the Donbas As a condition for peace, the Russian leader wants Kyiv to give up the Donbas, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the most intense fighting but that Russian forces have failed to capture completely. As part of a deal, Putin has said the United States and its European allies can provide Ukraine with a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense pledge, according to a senior U.S. READ MORE: Putin agreed to let U.S., Europe offer Ukraine NATO-like security protections, Trump envoy says Trump envoy Steve Witkoff called that a “game-changing” step though he offered few details on how it would work. Ukraine won’t surrender land to Russia Zelenskyy has rejected Putin’s demand that Ukraine surrender the Donbas region, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, since the Ukrainian Constitution forbids giving up territory or trading land. Europe’s security is also at stake in the talks European leaders see Ukraine’s fight as a bulwark against any Kremlin ambitions to threaten other countries in eastern Europe and beyond. French President Emmanuel Macron described Ukraine as an “outpost of our collective defense if Russia wanted to advance again.” “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” Macron said Sunday. The European political heavyweights expected in Washington are Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Civilians are killed as the fighting continues Ukraine has in recent months been losing more territory against Russia’s bigger army, and Moscow’s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of minor infiltrations in the Donetsk region ahead of the Alaska summit.

Article: A surviving roommate who encountered the masked intruder who slaughtered four University of Idaho students in an off-campus home in 2022 initially told investigators she heard an unknown male voice refer to a victim by her name. Amid the rampage, roommate Dylan Mortensen said she had opened her door and "heard a male say, 'It's OK Kaylee, I'm here for you,' and crying," according to a newly unsealed document written by Idaho State Police trooper Jeffory Talbot, based on a briefing received from a police sergeant in Moscow, Idaho. Investigators used DNA found on the button of a knife sheath left behind the room where Goncalves and Mogen were killed to help tie the attack to Bryan Kohberger, then a criminology Ph.D. Mortensen later adjusted what she told police after gathering "additional information," and said she believed it was Kernodle who had been crying in a bathroom, according to the documents, adding, "She advised she knows the male's voice was not Ethan's voice." From top left, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle. In the wake of Kohberger's sentencing last month, various law enforcement agencies, including police in Idaho and Washington state, have released new details about the case in documents and videos that were previously sealed. One professor warned colleagues that Kohberger "is smart enough that in four years, we will have to give him a Ph.D." "Mark my word, I work with predators, if we give him a Ph.D., that's the guy that in many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing" students, the professor said. A fellow student who spoke with police said she had a conversation with Kohberger after the murders and he told her that "whoever committed the homicides must have been pretty good." And, according to the student, Kohberger said the timing of the killings just before the start of winter break "made it a good choice." Kohberger declined to speak at his sentencing.

Article: WASHINGTON — Russia's illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 was quick and bloodless, and it sent Moscow's relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War. Putin has called the peninsula “a sacred place” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine — particularly the Crimean Tatars, who strongly opposed the annexation. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court’s finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it. A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin called its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin’s prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022, in July 2023 and in June 2025. Those also include Ukraine ceding the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022, dropping its bid to join NATO, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population.

Article: Soho House bought for £2bn as Ashton Kutcher joins board Just now Share Save Karen Hoggan Business Reporter Share Save Getty Images Ashton Kutcher will join the Soho House board Private members' club chain Soho House has been snapped up for $2.7bn (£2bn) by a consortium involving Hollywood actor turned investor Ashton Kutcher. The group opened its first club in London in 1995, and now has 46 Soho Houses in Europe, North America and Asia, as well a string of other up-market hospitality businesses. It is widely regarded as being a popular haunt of A-list celebrities, and one of its London venues was reportedly where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had their first date. But since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 the value of its shares has dropped sharply, as it struggled to make a profit amid a sense that it had lost the exclusivity it once had. The consortium is led by MCR Hotels, the third-biggest US hotel group, whose high profile properties include the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport in New York and the BT Tower in London. "We have long admired Soho House for bringing together cultures from around the world into a global network of 46 houses, and we look forward to the continued growth of that fabric, starting with four new houses opening soon." Reuters The first Soho House, opened by Mr Jones, was in London's Greek Street above his restaurant, Cafe Boheme. However, this expansion had resulted in accusations that Soho House was no longer as exclusive as members would expect given its membership fee, which can run into several thousand pounds. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while Soho House "can now boast a Hollywood star as a director", the chain would need "a bit more than celebrity stardust to cement its long-term future". "MCR Hotels, Ashton Kutcher and the other investors will have their work cut out to put Soho House back onto a more stable footing given concerns about the viability of its business model," she said. "Its rapid expansion in recent years has sparked concerns that its 'exclusive' label was wearing thin." She said it was a "challenging time" for the restaurant business, with "aspirational shoppers tightening their stylish belts".

WATCH: ‘Stop the insanity’: Texas Democrat urges GOP to end redistricting battle The nation’s two most populous states have been at the forefront of a national fight to reshape the congressional landscape ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Article: fired all of the members of an influential vaccine panel earlier this summer, he said the committee was “plagued with persistent conflicts of interest.” But new research, published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, finds that the two major vaccine advisory committees have had record-low conflicts of interest for nearly the past decade. Kennedy has long held that members of the vaccine advisory panels to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration maintain close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. “When he started citing these big statistics like 97%, I thought, ‘Wow, that’s really big,’” said lead study author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy. “When I started looking at the vaccine data, I wasn’t really seeing those kinds of numbers.” The study looked at how common conflicts of interest were over the last two decades for members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Kanter said that in the early 2000s, conflicts of interest on the committees were much higher — peaking at 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007. But starting around 2007 and 2012, members of the FDA’s VRBPAC started to undergo a more stringent vetting process, including requirements to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist, Kanter said. “You do want people who have done the clinical research on safety and efficacy.” She added that her previous research has shown that people who have financial ties to the competitor of any given product being discussed often don’t vote any differently than people who have no financial ties. In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “Secretary Kennedy is committed to eliminating both real and perceived conflicts to strengthen confidence in public health decisions.” ​​Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said it’s important for advisory panels to maintain low conflicts of interest because it helps prevent “skewed decision-making.” After Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP, he replaced them with eight new appointees, including several well-known vaccine critics. “They believe in a grand conspiracy where pharma controls the media and government, so for them, for example, an NIH grant would be a conflict of interest, or working in a health care organization.” Several of Kennedy’s new appointees, however, have ties to anti-vaccine groups or have served as expert witnesses in vaccine-related lawsuits, testifying on behalf of the plaintiffs suing vaccine makers. Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, said he wasn’t surprised by the new study's findings, noting that it’s common practice for committee members to recuse themselves from voting if a conflict arises.

But their real aim is to stop US President Donald Trump threatening long-term European security after his abrupt change of course over how best to end the war in Ukraine. Not only did Trump drop calls for a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks about long-term peace, he also - diplomats say - made clear he had no intention of imposing further economic sanctions on Russia. President Macron of France was the latest to use the C word, saying on Sunday: "There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia." Follow live updates on this story It takes a great deal for heads of government to upend their schedules at short notice – especially in August – when some are on holiday. But such was the scale of President Trump's change of strategy after meeting President Putin – and the consequent potential threat to Europe – that the European leaders changed their plans fast. Our question is what are we trying to achieve here?" They added: "The European position has long been that Putin needs to show a genuine desire to get around a table and stop the war, and that would involve a ceasefire. That means convincing Trump of two things: one, that questions about territory and security guarantees cannot be separated, and two, that security guarantees must be about more than verbal or textual promises. That's not good enough for Ukraine or us." Reuters Trump dropped calls for a ceasefire as a condition for talks about long-term peace after meeting Putin in Alaska last week

Article: Starmer offers support and pragmatism ahead of Ukraine meeting 3 hours ago Share Save Joe Pike Political correspondent Share Save PA Media President Zelensky visited Downing Street last week, just as President Trump was preparing to meet Russia's President Putin In all of Sir Keir Starmer's interventions on a possible Ukrainian peace process, there seems to be a significant gap between his careful public pronouncements and more pragmatic private views. Sir Keir has not said it explicitly but I am told the UK government privately accepts the premise of "land for peace" - Ukraine ceding territory as part of a peace deal with Russia. Secondly, Keir Starmer and his European colleagues want to flesh out details of what they hope will be "ironclad" security guarantees - measures to protect and defend Ukraine in the event a peace deal is struck. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff's recent endorsement of these proposed security guarantees as "game changing" is seen in No 10 as proof that months of work on Starmer and Macron's 'coalition of the willing' is finally paying off. We've got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just." But what exactly will Donald Trump contribute? Keir Starmer's calculation seem to be that for now he should be supportive and pragmatic, even if his hostility and scepticism towards Vladimir Putin does not seem to be shared by the US president.

Article: 21 minutes ago Share Save Tom Edgington and Nick Eardley BBC Verify correspondent Share Save Getty Images As Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives at the White House for talks aimed at ending the war, the scale of United States (US) support is once again under the spotlight. BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution. The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, according to the Kiel Institute, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine. Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed: "We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference" Getty Images BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and concluded Trump's numbers did not add up as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn. Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations. This prompted Macron - who was sat next the US president in the Oval Office at the time - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans. How much has the UK given to Ukraine The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

Article: Russian attacks on major Ukrainian cities have killed at least 12 people as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, DC, supported by European leaders, for high-stakes peace talks with United States President Donald Trump that could determine Ukraine’s future and its fate in the war, now in its fourth year. An entire family, including a toddler and a 16-year-old, were among seven people killed in an overnight drone strike on a residential neighbourhood in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, authorities said on Monday. Russian forces killed five people and injured four in attacks in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, where some of the fiercest fighting on the ground rages on and where Russian President Vladimir Putin, feeling Moscow has the upper hand, seeks Ukraine’s withdrawal from the third of the region Kyiv still controls. According to the United Nations monitoring mission on Ukraine, about 2,600 drone attacks were recorded in the past month, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, and more than 300 civilians were killed. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said on Monday that its drones had struck an oil-pumping station in the Tambov region, a strike 1,923km (1,195 miles) from Ukraine, leading to the suspension of supplies via the Druzhba pipeline. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said Zelenskyy saw the killing of civilians as a strategy aimed at giving Trump more bargaining chips with which to pressure Ukraine into accepting an unfavourable peace deal. It is also forbidden under the Ukrainian Constitution, The meeting comes on the heels of a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that ended with no clear breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Bell said a “catalyst” was needed to bring the war to a close, the most effective of which he believed to be Trump’s stiff tariffs on buyers of Russian oil and gas, like India. Advertisement Strength and safety in numbers appear to be factors in the group visit by European leaders with memories still fresh about the hostile reception Zelenskyy received in February from Trump and US Vice President JD Vance in a public White House dressing-down.

Article: CLEVELAND — Isaiah Bond, a rookie wide receiver who went undrafted after being arrested for sexual assault, has signed a contract with the Cleveland Browns just days after a grand jury in Texas declined to file charges. “We’ve spent much of the last calendar year getting to know Isaiah as a player and professional and much of the last four months gaining a full understanding of his legal situation," said Browns GM Andrew Berry in a statement released by the team. After his release, Bond said on social media that the accusation against him was "patently false." He later filed a federal lawsuit against the woman who made the accusation, which included a defamation claim. Last week, Collin County (Texas) District Attorney Greg Willis announced that the sexual assault case against Bond was no-billed by a grand jury, and he faces no further criminal charges. The full statement, which was posted to X, can be viewed below: In his statement, Bond addressed recent allegations, saying he has "refuted these allegations and maintained [his] innocence" and thanked the legal system for deciding not to pursue charges. "On the legal side, we have done extensive research that includes but is not limited to hearing from both sides of the case and receiving the results of an independently administered polygraph test," Berry added.

Article: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is visiting Armenia for talks on a planned corridor linking Azerbaijan near the border with his country, days after Iran said it would block the project included in a United States-brokered peace accord that puts a potential Washington presence on Iran’s doorstep. The land corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity” (TRIPP), is part of a deal signed earlier this month in Washington between former foes Armenia and Azerbaijan. Before departing for the Armenian capital Yerevan on Monday, Pezeshkian described the possible presence of American companies in the region as “worrying.” “We will discuss it [with Armenian officials] and express our concerns,” he told state television. Tehran has long opposed the planned transit route, also known as the Zangezur corridor, fearing it would cut the country off from Armenia and the rest of the Caucasus while bringing potentially hostile foreign forces close to its borders. Since the deal was signed on August 8, Iranian officials have stepped up warnings to Armenia, saying the project could be part of a US ploy “to pursue hegemonic goals in the Caucasus region”. “They [Armenian officials] have assured us that no American forces … or American security companies will be present in Armenia under the pretext of this route,” he told the official IRNA news agency. Trump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News soon after the deal was signed, adding that the area would become “a graveyard for Trump’s mercenaries”. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.

Article: The government of the United Kingdom has warned Irish novelist Sally Rooney against funding Palestine Action after she pledged support to the campaign group banned by the Labour-led government as a “terrorist” group last month. “There is a difference between showing support for a proscribed organisation, which is an offence under the Terrorism Act, and legitimate protest in support of a cause,” a spokesperson was quoted by PA Media. In an opinion piece in the Irish Times on Saturday, Rooney, the author of best-selling novels such as Normal People and Conversations with Friends, criticised the government’s move to ban the pro-Palestinian group. Palestine Action was banned after its activists broke into a military base in central England in June and sprayed red paint on two planes in protest against the UK’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Rooney said she chose the Dublin-based newspaper to publicise her intention rather than a UK one as doing so “would now be illegal” in Britain after the government banned Palestine Action. I want to be clear that I intend to use these proceeds of my work, as well as my public platform generally, to go on supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can,” she wrote. The spokesperson from the prime minister’s office said Palestine Action was proscribed “based on security advice following serious attacks the group has committed, following an assessment made by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre”. The government ban on Palestine Action came into force on July 5, days after it took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.3m) of damage to two aircraft. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the proscription of the group, stating: “UK national security and public safety must always be our top priority.” Advertisement “The assessments are very clear – this is not a nonviolent organisation,” she said. In her article, Rooney accused the UK government of “willingly stripping its own citizens of basic rights and freedoms, including the right to express and read dissenting opinions, in order to protect its relationship with Israel”.

Article: How you're using AI at work right now YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP via Getty Images On The Indicator's recent Jobs Friday episode, we told a few stories of how you all are using AI on the job. A high school teacher creates custom lessons, like an AI-generated pop song about monopolies and a Keynesian chatbot; A wedding photographer makes unwanted tables and exit signs disappear from her client's photos, but has to keep an eye out for creepy mistakes; A software engineer told us how AI is both boosting his productivity and triggering anxiety. We couldn't fit all the insightful, surprising, useful and unsettling ways you are using AI at work into one episode of The Indicator, so we've collected a few more use cases for you here. Overall, a portrait emerges: While many of you say AI is a time-saver, sometimes freeing you up for more face-to-face work, it also makes mistakes that beg for careful (and time-consuming) oversight. (Some of you even used AI to email us — check out listener Paul Elder's conversation with Gemini about emailing us, which he gave us permission to share here.) "Make this sound better" is Nick Messina's go-to prompt whenever he writes a proposal as a civil engineer in Portland, Maine. "I have to dial it back to make it sound more like the words of an engineer rather than a marketing influencer." He also uses AI to summarize reports, but has run into some trouble with that use. Freeing up time for human work The budget at the public library in Norwood, Colorado — population 526 — where Erin Dann works is "razor thin." So, the 46-year-old, who is tasked with designing programs for all ages, has outsourced some of that work to AI. "I usually heavily edit whatever AI spits out," Erin wrote, "but even just having an outline to work from is very helpful." Role play Jeffrey Anvari-Clark, a 47-year-old listener in Grand Forks, North Dakota, has been using AI to get more done as an assistant professor of social work. German is not Genevieve's native language, so AI helps her write letters of congratulations to people who have accomplished certain items from a list of dozens of possibilities in the language. She's trained the LLM she works with to accept a 'yes-or-no' checklist of accomplishments, then rephrase everything with a 'flowery congratulations.' Genevieve has to look over the letters before she sends them, though — occasionally, it adds a sentence referring to a previous candidate. Paul runs every AI-generated script through a different AI for "independent review." Once, an AI returned him a script with a "severe error that could have caused a system-wide meltdown." The near-catastrophe reinforced an important lesson for Paul: AI is not a replacement for human expertise. "I must understand my job, the systems, and the potential risks." Not everyone finds it time saving to have AI help, including Lynn Pepin, a 29 year-old software engineer in Connecticut. "Even when these tools do things right (and they increasingly do!), I spend more mental energy going over the generated code with a fine-tuned comb than I would writing it myself." And more … Thanks to everyone who wrote to us about how you use AI at work. And if you have more innovative or anxiety-inducing ways that AI is changing your industry that you think we're missing, please reply to this email and tell us about it.

Article: Putin is offering to freeze the conflict in the rest of Ukraine along the current front lines and to provide a written promise not to attack again, according to the senior European officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. The Ukrainian authorities estimate that more than 200,000 civilians still live in the corner of the Donbas that they control, primarily in the densely populated and heavily fortified industrial sprawl in and around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Putin has initially presented the invasion as the defense of the region’s pro-Russian separatists, who had fought against the government in Kyiv with the Kremlin’s military and financial support since 2014. “Donetsk is perceived as way more ‘ours’ than Dnipro, Sumy or Kharkiv,” said Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political scientist and former Kremlin adviser, referring to Ukrainian regions with a limited presence of Russian troops. The Donbas has been contested since Ukraine first emerged as a state in the early 20th century, when Ukrainian nationalists, Communists and Russian monarchists battled for the region’s industrial riches in a chaotic period after the Bolshevik Revolution. Most of the region’s population was Ukrainian until Stalin’s campaigns of forced industrialization and terror led to the migration of Russian workers to the region’s coal mines and factories, mass killing of Ukrainian farmers and the suppression of Ukrainian language. Putin has periodically alluded to annexing other parts of Ukraine, leading Ukrainian officials and many Western politicians and analysts to argue that the war would continue after Russia takes the Donbas, whether by force or diplomacy. “Russian society is in such a deplorable state that it would be willing to accept almost any outcome of the war,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian politics expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “We can imagine various degrees of discontent from certain marginal segments of society — “ultra-patriots” and the likes of them — but the Kremlin can manage it.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Berlin, and Constant Méheut from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Article: Putin’s revised ask — the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, often referred to as the Donbas — has been interpreted by Washington as a concession, even though the original proposal had been laughable to U.S. Witkoff said Russia previously demanded the entirety of all five regions in Ukraine that the Kremlin had declared annexed, including Crimea, up to the administrative borders, but “the Russians made some concessions at the table.” Mr. Putin agreed that the United States and its Western allies could provide security guarantees to Ukraine, along the lines of NATO’s Article 5, so long as Ukraine wasn’t admitted to the alliance. But at the time, Moscow also tried to insert a clause that would have given the Kremlin veto power over an international response in the event of a new invasion, a deal breaker for Ukraine. But critics quickly seized on the Kremlin’s history of disregarding Russia’s own laws, including a Constitution that, among other things, guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of the press, both of which Mr.

Article: The major averages finished last week on a high note , after the latest inflation data suggested higher pricing pressures in some parts of the economy that nevertheless wasn't so severe as to take a September rate cut off the table. On Friday, Fabio Bassi, head of cross-asset strategy at JP Morgan, told investors to brace themselves for incoming volatility, especially if macroeconomic data continues to come in weaker than expected. Investors are questioning the catalysts for a correction in risk assets, when the Fed is 'coming to the rescue' and the outlook in 2026 looks rosier," Bassi wrote in a note titled "Estote Parati: Calm Markets Can Precede Volatility." "Estote Parati" is a Latin phrase that translates to "Be Prepared." "However, investors should not be complacent," he continued. "Bad macro news so far has been perceived as good news for risk assets given shallow and temporary weakness cushioned by the 'Fed put'; however, bad news could turn truly detrimental if macro weakness appears large or persistent." Bassi said he does not hold a recession in his base case, but he nevertheless worries that downside risk has grown especially after the market's major runup this year. Many market observers point out that the S & P 500, which is currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is priced for perfection and could be due for a pullback. Bassi expects a 5% to 10% pullback is in the cards, which would knock the S & P 500 back down to about 5,800 or 6,000, from around 6,450 where it was last. "In the short term, we expect growth risks to come to the forefront for investors, as the impact of tariffs gets reflected in prices and consumer spending, amid a retracement for the large frontloading of the first half of the year," Bassi wrote.

Article: Darryl George's case against Barbers Hill ISD dismissed and sex discrimination claim proceeds A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed claims of racial discrimination while allowing claims of sex discrimination to proceed in a federal civil rights lawsuit regarding a Texas student who has faced suspensions and disciplinary actions over the length of his locs hairstyle. District Court Judge Jeffrey Vincent Brown said in his decision that the claims of racial discrimination in the lawsuit brought by Darryl George, a student at Barbers Hill High School, and his family "have not shown a persistent, widespread practice of disparate, race-based enforcement" of the hair policy. "At most, the plaintiffs allege only two instances: the allegations underlying George's case and those underlying the Arnold case also pending in this court," Brown said, referencing another case of a Black teen who was suspended over his hair. "But these two instances alone are insufficient to establish a pattern of conduct going on 'for so long or so frequently' that it evinces a 'persistent, widespread practice.'" Regarding the claims of sex discrimination, Brown said while the school district gives reasons that show why they have a dress code, "they provide no support for the narrower question that forms the basis of this claim: what is the rationale for the dress code's distinction between male and female students?" RELATED: Judge sides with Barbers Hill ISD in hair discrimination trial involving high school student "Because the district does not provide any reason for the sex-based distinctions in its dress code, the claim survives this initial stage," Brown said. The judge dismissed all of the family's other claims, including infringement of George's First Amendment free expression rights and request for "compensatory damages and injunctive and declaratory relief" for claims of "mental anguish." CNN has reached out to George's attorneys for comment. Barbers Hill Independent School District Superintendent Greg Poole said in a statement Wednesday that the decision to dismiss the racial claims "validates what our district has maintained throughout this ordeal ... high expectations for all students in all things are not racist." "Our policies and our procedures for 95 years have been established by our community via a locally elected board of trustees. Having high expectations for all students in all things is why we are one of the highest achieving districts in the state, and it is why parents of all ethnicities continue to move to our district in record numbers," Poole wrote. "Our district will not succumb to a cancerous cancel culture that seeks to intimidate, falsely accuse, and use race in a disingenuous way to serve a political end." RELATED: A Black student punished for his hairstyle wants to return to the Texas school he left The ruling comes months after a separate federal judge ruled the state's CROWN Act - a law that prohibits discrimination against hair texture and protective hairstyles like locs and braids that are "commonly or historically associated with race" - does not make it unlawful for school dress codes to limit a student's hair length, meaning it did not violate state law for the district to continue punishing George for the length of his locs hairstyle. George and his family were seeking an injunction against Abbott and Paxton to compel them to stop the school district from "exposing BHISD and Texas students to disciplinary punishment and disciplinary measures due to locs, braids, twists, and other protective styles that are alleged to be or that are longer than the District or schools' length requirement." Brown, in his decision, also dismissed the claims against Abbott and Paxton. Attorneys for Abbott and Paxton had argued for dismissal, citing claims of immunity from lawsuits and saying they do not have "enforcement authority under the CROWN Act, nor do they have a general duty to intervene when a public school district is merely accused of violating a student's constitutional rights or rights provided under a provision of State law." CNN has reached out to attorneys for Abbott and Paxton for comment.

Article: Two months into his second term as president, Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order intended to overhaul dramatically how elections are administered in the United States, taking aim at everything from voter registration requirements to election equipment to mail-in ballot deadlines. Election experts said that Trump was claiming power he does not have and that lawsuits over the measure were all but guaranteed.” Predictably, the executive order faced immediate legal challenges, and a federal judges blocked the Republican’s outlandish power grab from going forward. NBC News reported: Trump said in a post to Truth Social that he would sign an executive order to try to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines, a move that would almost certainly face immediate challenges in court. The 288-word online tantrum — complete with six exclamation points, a robust number of sentences written with the caps lock on and the word “woke” — was remarkable in its inanity. But the Republican, who’s become increasingly unsubtle about his authoritarian ambitions, also made clear that he’s eyeing yet another power grab, claiming an administrative authority over elections that the Constitution explicitly gives to states. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.” As part of the same tirade, the president added, “WE WILL BEGIN THIS EFFORT ... He’s already talked about a new census count to help Republicans in the 2026 cycle, which coincides with a White House effort to get red states to rig their district maps to boost GOP candidates.

Article: Around this time five years ago, Belarus’ Aleksandr Lukashenko named himself the winner of a rigged presidential election, extending a tenure that began in 1994, and held a secret inauguration ceremony. The path forward should be a national dialogue leading to the Belarusian people enjoying their right to choose their leaders in a free and fair election under independent observation.” A lot can happen in five years, however. While the Trump’s team in his first term made a rather obvious diplomatic call by rejecting an illegitimate election in a country led one of Vladmir Putin’s regional puppets, things are far different in the American president’s second term. Bloomberg reported: US President Donald Trump spoke with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, a Kremlin ally under a range of international sanctions, in a rare direct call ahead of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. We discussed many topics, including President Putin’s visit to Alaska.’ The Republican added, in reference to the Belarusian leader his administration refused to acknowledge as legitimate five years earlier, “I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future.” I won’t pretend to know whether Trump intended for this online missive to be significant, but it raised a few eyebrows for a few reasons. Aliyev, who’s been repeatedly accused by international observers of being a dictator, replied, “It’s been 22 years.” The American president, clearly impressed, said, “Twenty-two years, that’s pretty good.” At that point, Trump turned to attendees and added, “That means he’s tough and smart.” It was a timely reminder: The Republican doesn’t admire dictators despite their despotism, he admires them because of their despotism. The American has also celebrated North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as an “absolute leader” and praised China’s Xi Jinping as a “brilliant man” who controls 1.4 billion people with an “iron fist.” As Election Day 2024 approached, Trump told voters, “It’s nice to have a strongman running the country,” adding, “Sometimes you need a strongman.” With this in mind, his praise for Lukashenko was ridiculous — but hardly out of character.

Article: Rodrigo Paz, and a right-wing former president, Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, will face off in October after a first round of voting knocked out candidates allied with the nation’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party. Paz, a former mayor, campaigned with the slogan “Capitalism for all” — rejecting the statist policies of MAS while pitching a more inclusive approach to rescuing Bolivia from its worst economic crisis in four decades. “The vast majority of people have expressed that desire for renewal — merchants, the self-employed, transport workers, the great majority of this country.” Paz had been trailing in opinion polls for weeks. But he gained unexpected traction as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing who was fired for denouncing corruption in the security services. “We did not invest millions, we invested in the people’s trust,” Lara told local media on Monday, seeking to portray his ticket as a humble alternative to that of the wealthy right-wingers who poured exorbitant sums into campaigning. “While others spent fortunes on posters and TV spots, we trusted in the strength of the citizens and a message of unity.” Paz secured a lead over Quiroga with over 32% of the votes cast. “Now, the ball is in the hands of the Bolivian people,” said leftist President Luis Arce, who will leave office following plummeting approval ratings reflecting popular frustration with his government’s mismanagement of the economy. “Democracy has triumphed!” A shift away from decades of leftist party rule The results delivered a blow to Bolivia’s hegemonic MAS party, which has governed almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leaders who swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country’s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs. READ MORE: Bolivia’s economic turmoil fuels distrust in government and its claim of a failed coup Annual inflation rate has soared from 2% less than two years ago to 25% as of last month. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades, even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite. Followers of Morales heed calls to vote null Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president. Whisked away by guards, Rodríguez later called it a “difficult moment.” A centrist draws leftists wary of a right-wing lurch Paz’s victory came as a shock, as opinion polls had long suggested that Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina would be the top two contenders. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. “People wanted something new, and, after not finding that in a radical on the right or someone who fully represented socialism, they have obviously opted for Paz,” said Álvaro Chipana, who was strolling Monday in the affluent southern part of Bolivia’s capital of La Paz. a former president Paz’s supporters have described the former mayor Bolivia’s southern town of Tarija as a fresh face with new ideas, in contrast to Doria Medina and Quiroga, who served in the U.S.-backed neoliberal administrations that Morales repudiated when he stormed to office in 2006, declaring an end to Bolivia’s 20-year experiment with free-market capitalism.

The Democrats did not confirm any specific action they plan to take on or off the House floor, but they say that they are going to build a "legal case against the discriminatory map". "We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation -- reshaping the entire 2026 landscape," Democratic Caucus chair state Rep. "We're returning to Texas more dangerous to Republicans' plans than when we left." After the Texas state legislature began a second special legislative session on Friday and failed still to meet quorum, Republican legislators are expected to try for a quorum Monday and then to work to advance proposed new congressional maps, which will have to once again pass through the House's redistricting committee and procedural votes. Gavin Newsom formally announced plans to get new congressional maps to go before voters in November in a counter to Texas, the state legislature will convene on Monday from recess and is set to rapidly work on passing legislation to get the maps on the ballot.

The multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. They regard the operation as an ineffectual waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah’s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese Armed Forces that the government says it is not yet capable of doing. funding to the peacekeeping force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed off early last week on a plan that would wind down and end UNIFIL in the next six months, according to Trump administration officials and congressional aides familiar with the discussions. ambassador to Turkey and envoy to Lebanon, they successfully lobbied Rubio and others to support a one-year extension of the peacekeeping mandate followed by a time-certain wind-down period of six months, according to the administration officials and congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations. vote expected at the end of August now appears to be resistance by France and others to setting a firm deadline for the operation to end after the one-year extension, according to the officials and congressional aides.

Khalil Helou said that if UNIFIL’s mandate were to abruptly end, soldiers would need to be pulled away from the porous border with Syria, where smuggling is rife, or from other areas inside of Lebanon — “and this could have consequences for the stability” of the country.

Article: President Donald Trump walked into a summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin pressing for a ceasefire deal and threatening “severe consequences” and tough new sanctions if the Kremlin leader failed to agree to halt the fighting in Ukraine U.S. ((Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump walked into a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin pressing for a ceasefire deal and threatening “severe consequences” and tough new sanctions if the Kremlin leader failed to agree to halt the fighting in Ukraine. After calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote as he flew home from Friday's meeting in Alaska that it had been “determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” It was a dramatic reversal that laid bare the challenges of dealing with Putin, a cunning adversary, as well as the complexities of a conflict that Trump had repeatedly boasted during his campaign that he could solve within 24 hours. While European leaders were relieved that Trump did not agree to a deal that ceded territory or otherwise favored Moscow, the summit allowed Putin to reclaim his place on the world stage and may have bought Russia more time to push forward with its offensive in Ukraine. “We’re back to where we were before without him having gone to Alaska,” said Fiona Hill, who served as Trump’s senior adviser on Russia at the National Security Council during his first term, including when he last met Putin in Helsinki in 2018. president and think he’s “not the big guy that he thinks he is and certainly not the dealmaking genius.” “All the way along, Trump was convinced he has incredible forces of persuasion,” she said, but he came out of the meeting without a ceasefire — the “one thing” he had been pushing for, even after he gave the Russian leader the “red carpet treatment." Trump has “run up against a rock in the form of Putin, who doesn’t want anything from him apart from Ukraine," she said. At home, Democrats expressed alarm at what at times seemed like a day of deference, with Trump clapping for Putin as he walked down a red carpet during an elaborate ceremony welcoming him to U.S. Trump seemed to revel in particular in Putin echoing his oft-repeated assertion that Russia never would have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been in office instead of Democrat Joe Biden at the time. Before news cameras, Trump did not use the opportunity to castigate Putin for launching the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II or human rights abuses he's been accused of committing. “The President rolled out a red carpet and warmly greeted a murderous dictator on American soil and reports indicate he got nothing concrete in return.” “Enough is enough," she went on. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he supports diplomacy but “peacemaking must be done responsibly.” “Instead of caving to Putin, the U.S. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, wrote on social media after the summit that “while the press conference offered few details about their meeting" she was "cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made." Murkowski said it “was also encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings" but that Ukraine “must be part of any negotiated settlement and must freely agree to its terms.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, offered that he was “very proud” of Trump for having had the face-to-face meeting and was “cautiously optimistic” that the war might end “well before Christmas” if a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin transpires. For some Trump allies, the very act of him meeting with Putin was success enough: conservative activist and podcaster Charlie Kirk called it “a great thing.” But in Europe, the summit was seen as a major diplomatic coup for Putin, who has been eager to emerge from geopolitical isolation. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, praised the summit as a breakthrough in restoring high-level dialogue between Moscow and Washington, describing the talks as “calm, without ultimatums and threats.” Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said the summit was “a distinct win for Putin.

Article: It has been 150 years since miners first flocked to South Dakota's Black Hills in a gold rush that displaced Native Americans This image provided by EcoFlight shows an aerial view of a road winding through the pine-covered Black Hills on Tuesday, May 23, 2023. Now, a new crop of miners driven by gold prices at more than $3,000 an ounce are seeking to return to the treasured landscape, promising an economic boost while raising fears of how modern gold extraction could forever change the region. “These impacts can be long term and make it so that tourism and outdoor recreation is negatively impacted,” said Lilias Jarding, executive director of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance. “Our enjoyment of the Black Hills as a peaceful place, a sacred place, is disturbed.” The Black Hills encompass over 1.2 million acres (485,622 hectares), rising up from the Great Plains in southwest South Dakota and extending into Wyoming. The jagged peaks are smaller than those of the Rocky Mountains, but the lush pine-covered hills are sacred to the Lakota Sioux people and serve as a destination for millions of tourists who visit Mount Rushmore and state parks. One gold mine now operates in the Black Hills, but companies have proposals before state and federal agencies for another one, plus exploratory drilling sites that they hope will lead to full-fledged mines. That’s why gold as an asset in investment.” President Donald Trump also boosted the industry by issuing an executive order in March to increase American mineral production, calling for expedited permitting and reviews. Jack Henris, president and chief operating officer of Dakota Gold, estimated the open pit mine would create up to 250 jobs and result in the company paying the state up to $400 million in taxes over the life of the mine. “So we’re a big part of the Hills and we love them just as much as other folks.” To a great extent, gold mining helped create the modern Black Hills region. government signed a treaty in 1868 that recognized the Sioux Nation's right to the Black Hills, but the government seized the land after the discovery of gold and allowed settlers into the region. “There’s a central truth about mining in the Black Hills in that it was never the most mineral rich place there ever was,” said Taylor Gunhammer, local organizer with the Indigenous advocacy group NDN Collective and an Oglala Sioux, one of the Lakota people. It’s the permissive nature of the officials who oversee mining.” Some proposed projects, such as Dakota Gold’s mine, are on private land and only subject to state rules, not the U.S. Coeur’s environmental manager, Jasmine McCauley, said in a statement that each spill was "thoroughly investigated, mitigated, and corrective actions are put in place to prevent reoccurrence.” The company is always improving its processes, she added.

Article: President Donald Trump a united front against Russia WASHINGTON -- Ukraine's future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings with him an extraordinary cadre of European leaders to show U.S. The European political heavy-hitters were left out of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they are looking to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. By arriving as a group, they hope to avoid any debacles like Zelenskyy’s February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. The meeting also is a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. Monday’s showing is a sign both of the progress and the possible distress coming out of the Alaska meeting as many of Europe’s leaders are descending on Washington with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine’s interests, a rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He went on to say that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. and European countries Ukraine will be able to force Russia to “true peace.” Planning to join Zelenskyy in America's capital are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The president also bemoaned media coverage of his summit with Putin and said on Truth Social: "I had a great meeting in Alaska." Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a ceasefire was still possible but that “the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal." European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it. "How that’s constructed, what we call it, how it’s built, what guarantees are built into it that are enforceable, that’s what we’ll be talking about over the next few days with our partners who are coming in from overseas,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Rubio said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that such a commitment “would be a very big move" by Trump. Ahead of Monday's meeting, France's Macron stressed the importance of building up Ukraine's military and the need to show Putin that Europe interprets his moves as a threat to other nations. “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too,” Macron said.

Article: Road safety activists and some states are pushing to depart from a longstanding rule that sets speed limits in the United States based largely on how fast drivers actually travel Rose Hammond pushed authorities for years to lower the 55 mph speed limit on a two-lane road that passes her assisted living community, a church, two schools and a busy park that hosts numerous youth sports leagues. “What are you waiting for, somebody to get killed?” the 85-year-old chided officials in northwest Ohio, complaining that nothing was being done about the motorcycles that race by almost daily. The reason dates back to studies on rural roads from the 1930s and 1940s that still play an outsized role in the way speed limits are set across the U.S. Born from that research was a widely accepted concept known as the 85% rule, which suggests a road’s posted speed should be tied to the 15th-fastest vehicle out of every 100 traveling it in free-flowing traffic, rounded to the nearest 5 mph increment. If drivers think the speed limit should be raised, they can simply step on the gas and “vote with their feet,” as an old brochure from the Institute of Transportation Engineers once put it. “People speed, and then the speed limits will be ratcheted up to match that speed.” The association developed an alternative to the 85% rule known as “City Limits,” which aims to minimize the risk of injuries for all road users by setting the speed limit based on a formula that factors in a street's activity level and the likelihood of conflicts, such as collisions. The report points out the 85% rule is based on dated research and that “these historic roads are a far cry from the vibrant streets and arterials that typify city streets today.” Amid a recent spike in road deaths across the country, the Federal Highway Administration sent a subtle but important message to states that the 85% rule isn't actually a rule at all and was carrying too much weight in determining local speed limits. In its first update since 2009 to a manual that establishes national guidelines for traffic signs, the agency clarified that communities should also consider such things as how the road is used, the risk to pedestrians, and the frequency of crashes. Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said she wishes the manual had gone further in downplaying the 85% rule but acknowledges the change has already impacted the way some states set speed limits. Under its “20 is Plenty” campaign, the Wisconsin capital of Madison has been changing signs across the city this summer, lowering the speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph on local residential streets. When Seattle took a similar step in a pilot program seven years ago, not only did it see a noticeable decline in serious injury crashes but also a 7% drop in the 85th percentile speed, according to the Vision Zero Network. “There’s still a very heavy mindset that automobiles are the primary method of travel and they should be given priority and reverence.” But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said following the 85% rule is usually the safest way to minimize the variation in speed between drivers who abide by the posted limit and those who far exceed it. It would be patently unfair for a government to build a road to encourage people to drive 45 mph, put a 30 mph speed limit on it, and then ticket everyone for doing what they built the road to do.” Fears about oil prices prompted Congress in the 1970s to set a 55 mph national maximum speed limit, which it later relaxed to 65 mph before repealing the law in 1995 and handing the authority to states. Although high-speed freeways outside major population centers aren't the focus of most efforts to ease the 85% rule, a 2019 study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — a research arm funded by auto insurers — illustrates the risks. “Maybe back when you were driving a Model T you had a real feel for how fast you were going, but in modern vehicles you don't have a sense of what 80 mph is. The state now gives more consideration to roadway context and allows cities to reduce speed limits based on the lower standard of the 50th percentile speed when there's a large presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. “States have very slowly started to move away from the 85th percentile as being kind of the gold standard for decision-making,” said Michelle May, who manages Ohio's highway safety program. “People are traveling and living differently than they did 40 years ago, and we want to put safety more at the focus.” It's unclear whether any of these changes will ultimately impact the posted speed on Mitchaw Road.

Takeaways from the Trump-Putin meeting: No agreement, no questions but lots of pomp President Donald Trump, right, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin depart at the conclusion of a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. After about 2 1/2 hours of talks at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, the two men appeared before reporters for what had been billed as a joint news conference — but they took no questions. after being shunned by Western allies since early 2022 for ordering the invasion of Ukraine, thanked Trump for hosting the meeting and suggested with a chuckle that the next time the two sit down it could be in Moscow. There, the pair were joined by two of their top aides: Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff for Trump and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and national security adviser Yuri Ushakov for Putin. Putin, who spoke first after the meeting concluded, lauded the historical relationship between the United States, Russia and the former Soviet Union, recalling joint missions conducted by the two countries during World War II. Trump had gone into the meeting hoping to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine — or at least a commitment from Russia to enter into negotiations to reach one. Trump said he and Putin had made some significant progress toward the goal of ending the conflict but gave no details on what that entailed and had to acknowledge that they had been unable to bridge substantial gaps. Putin praised Trump for the “friendly” tone of the talks — Trump said nothing publicly about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Moscow's attacks — and for “understanding that Russia has its own national interests.” Putin said Moscow and Washington should “turn the page,” with relations having sunk to the lowest point since the Cold War. In a social media post, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told followers that the Western press would be on the verge of “losing their minds.” “For three years, they talked about Russia’s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet being rolled out to greet the Russian president in the United States,” she said. The news conference ended up being less than 15 minutes of rather standard diplomatic comments — and gave no indication that any concrete results were achieved — and offered little departure from their previous comments on the war in Ukraine. Trump had gone into the summit saying here was a 25% chance that the summit would fail and that it was meant to be a “feel-out meeting,” but he had also floated the idea of bringing Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting if things went well.

Article: we’re just gonna turn back and be safe so we can do this again another time.” The extreme temperatures in this stretch of California desert attract visitors every year, some determined to finish a grueling, multiday race, others just curious about the sizzling heat and the landscape's vast beauty. Yet despite the warnings, the heat kills one to three people annually, and park rangers respond to overheated visitors multiple times per week, making communication about heat safety a priority for the National Park Service. Death Valley holds the record for the hottest temperature ever officially recorded — 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 — although some experts have disputed it and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) there in July 2021. Information that explicitly says rescue might not be an option if it’s too hot “takes away that sense of the control that can lead to underestimating risk.” Failing to recognize those risks can be deadly. “Depending on their situation,” Wines said, that's “probably too late.” Two of the park's busiest months are in the summer, and it sees a small bump in visitors when temperatures are expected to hit the high 120s or 130s F (48.89s to 54.44s C). “That's why people disregard it.” Jennifer Marlon, senior research scientist at the Yale School of the Environment, has studied public perceptions of the health risks of extreme heat across the U.S. And while this isn't something the park would initiate, if scientists gave names to heat waves, similar to how hurricanes are named, that could better grab people’s attention because human brains are attuned to novelty, Marlon said. “Whatever the recommended behavior is, show them pictures of that behavior because we’re incredibly and fundamentally social animals, and body language is so much of how we communicate,” Marlon said.

Article: California man rescued after being trapped for 2 days behind waterfall California police used a helicopter to rescue a man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, law enforcement official said. Ryan Wardwell, 46, of Long Beach, California, had planned to rappel down waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups on Sunday in a remote area about two hours south of Sequoia National Park, the Tulare County Sheriff's Office said. It was early Tuesday when a dive and rescue team used a drone to pinpoint Wardwell, who was alive and responsive behind a large waterfall, police said He came off his rappelling lines when “the extreme hydraulics of the river” trapped him behind the cascade, police said. The Seven Teacups is a popular outdoor recreational area, made up by the cascades of the Dry Meadow Creek forming distinctive pools along their route to the North Fork of the Kern River.

Brighty is a small but important part of what will be a yearslong effort for the National Park Service as it charts a path for restoration and reconstruction on the North Rim. Persistent hot, dry and windy weather has hampered crews over the past several weeks, making it more difficult to fight the flames on the North Rim and elsewhere around the West — from Idaho and Montana to California, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico.

According to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Herman was fired in May 2024 after detectives with the Specialized Investigations Divisions discovered the video and identified him while wearing his MNPD uniform. Officials say Herman can be seen taking part in a mock traffic stop in the video that was posted on OnlyFans, a site where fans pay creators for their photos and videos. In August 2024, a state board indefinitely suspended Herman of his certification to be a law enforcement officer in Tennessee, with the understanding that he could argue to be reinstated once the criminal case is closed.

The Department of Corrections' critical incident review of Grant Hardin's May 25 escape from the Calico Rock prison provides the most detailed description so far of his planning and the issues that allowed him to walk out of the facility. Hardin, who worked in the prison's kitchen, said he spent six months planning his escape and used black Sharpie markers and laundry he found lying around the kitchen to create the fake uniform, according to the report. They include a kitchen employee who allowed Hardin on a back dock unsupervised and a tower guard who unlocked the back gate that Hardin walked through without confirming his identity. He was the subject of the TV documentary “Devil in the Ozarks.” The report is one of two reviews into Hardin's escape, which is also being investigated by the Arkansas State Police. The Department of Corrections' review says officials had taken several steps since Hardin's escape, including removing the electric locks from the gates to prevent someone from walking out without an officer present. The report also calls for additional cameras after finding a blind spot on the dock Hardin used, and for any “shakedown” searches for contraband to include mechanical rooms and side rooms.

"As a result, the Court must accept that this choice advances the public interest and operate from that premise.” Conservation groups that are appealing the decision acknowledged that the clock was ticking but said they were not giving up. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, the group Apache Stronghold and other plaintiffs having been fighting in court for years to save what tribal members call Chi’chil Bildagoteel, which is dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. Before the land exchange can happen, they argued that the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that considers “every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure.” The plaintiffs also raised concerns that an appraisal failed to account for the value of the copper deposits underlying one of the federal parcels to be exchanged The fight over Oak Flat dates back about 20 years, when legislation proposing the land exchange was first introduced. Resolution Copper — a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP — estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona’s economy and create thousands of jobs.

Article: -- California is the first Democratic-led state to wade into a brewing national redistricting fight after President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to draw new maps to maintain the party's slim U.S. The Texas plan was temporarily stalled when minority Democrats left the state to stop the Legislature from passing any bills, but some lawmakers said they'll return to Texas now that California is moving forward with its counter act. State Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers — enough to act without any Republican votes — and Newsom has said he’s not worried about winning the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers to advance the maps. On Friday, a coalition of county officials urged the Legislature to provide money in advance, because many counties are cash-strapped, and officials worry they won't have enough money to administer the election. Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., who spent tens of millions to support the California ballot initiative that gives redistricting power to an independent commission, also plans to “vigorously defend” nonpartisan redistricting, his spokesperson said.

Article: South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea South Korean protesters stage a rally to oppose the joint military exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield or UFS, between the U.S. and South Korea." (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea and the United States began their annual large-scale joint military exercise on Monday to better cope with threats by nuclear-armed North Korea, which has warned the drills would deepen regional tensions and vowed to respond to “any provocation” against its territory. The 11-day Ulchi Freedom Shield, the second of two large-scale exercises held annually in South Korea, after another set in March, will involve 21,000 soldiers, including 18,000 South Koreans, in computer-simulated command post operations and field training. The drills, which the allies describe as defensive, could trigger a response from North Korea, which has long portrayed the allies’ exercises as invasion rehearsals and has often used them as a pretext for military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program. In a statement last week, North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol said the drills show the allies’ stance of “military confrontation” with the North and declared that its forces would be ready to counteract “any provocation going beyond the boundary line.” Ulchi Freedom Shield comes at a pivotal moment for South Korea’s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who is preparing for an Aug. Trump has raised concerns in Seoul that he may shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the American troop presence in South Korea and possibly reducing it as Washington shifts its focus more toward China. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high as North Korea has brushed aside Lee’s calls to resume diplomacy with its war-divided rival, with relations having soured in recent years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerated his weapons program and deepened alignment with Moscow following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “What's needed now is the courage to steadily take steps toward easing tensions, grounded in a firmly maintained state of ironclad security readiness,” Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume frontline military activities and propaganda campaigns. When asked whether the Lee government’s steps to restore the agreement would affect the allies’ drills, the South’s Defense Ministry said Monday that there are no immediate plans to suspend live-fire training near the Koreas’ disputed western maritime border. military officials denied South Korean media speculation that the scaled-back drills were meant to make room for diplomacy with the North, citing heat concerns and flood damage to some training fields. Public comments by senior Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have suggested a push to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”

Article: Bolivia’s presidential vote is headed to an unprecedented runoff after Sunday’s election ended over two decades of ruling party dominance in the Andean nation Bolivia heads to a runoff after an election ends 2 decades of ruling party dominance Presidential candidate Rodrigo Paz, center, waves to supporters after early results showed him leading in the presidential election in La Paz, Bolivia, Sunday, Aug. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia’s presidential vote is headed to an unprecedented runoff after Sunday's election ended over two decades of ruling party dominance in the Andean nation. Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition’s push for austerity to rescue Bolivia from a looming economic collapse, will face off against former President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, who finished second. “This economic model must change,” Paz declared to crowds who cheered and chanted, “Renewal!” Paz’s campaign had gained unexpected traction as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing whose supporters see him as someone willing to stand up to corruption in the security forces. “Bolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.” The results delivered a blow to Bolivia’s Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leaders who swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country’s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades, even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite. Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president. Whisked away by guards, Rodríguez later called it a “difficult moment.” The win for Paz came as a shock to a nation that had been conditioned by weeks of opinion polls to expect that the leading contenders, Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina, would capture the top two spots. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. The 57-year-old lawmaker is the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who began his political career as a co-founder of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a party persecuted under the bloody military dictatorship of Hugo Banzer in the 1970s.

Article: Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area Cloudbursts are causing chaos in parts of India and Pakistan. (AP Photo/Muhammad Sajjad) ISLAMABAD -- Cloudbursts are causing chaos in mountainous parts of India and Pakistan, with tremendous amounts of rain falling in a short period of time over a concentrated area. Here’s what to know about cloudbursts: A cloudburst occurs when a large volume of rain falls in a very short period, usually more than 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) within an hour over a localized area, around 30 square kilometers (11.6 square miles). The frequency of cloudbursts in these two South Asian nations has been steadily rising due to a warming atmosphere, because a warmer air mass can hold more moisture, creating conditions for sudden and intense downpours. Asfandyar Khan Khattak, a Pakistani official from the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said there was “no forecasting system anywhere in the world” that could predict the exact time and location of a cloudburst. The Pakistani government said that while an early warning system was in place in Buner district, where hundreds of people died after a cloudburst, the downpour was so sudden and intense that it struck before residents could be alerted. “Rising global temperatures have supercharged the hydrologic cycle, leading to more intense and erratic rainfall,” said Khalid Khan, a former special secretary for climate change in Pakistan and chairman of climate initiative PlanetPulse. In short, climate change is making rare events more frequent, and frequent events more destructive." ___ Associated Press writers Munir Ahmed and Riaz Khan contributed to this report from Islamabad and Peshawar, Pakistan, respectively.

Article: President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House to discuss how to end Russia’s three-year war in Ukraine The stakes are high as Zelenskyy and European leaders head to Washington In this photo taken from video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Monday, Aug. President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss how to end Russia's three-year war in Ukraine. After that summit, Trump abandoned the requirement of reaching a ceasefire in order to hold further talks and aligned with Putin's position that negotiations should focus on a long-term settlement instead. They are looking to safeguard Ukraine and Europe more broadly from any further aggression from Moscow — but also are providing a show of support for Zelenskyy after his last visit to the White House led to an angry confrontation. A lot of issues need to be resolved, however, and the two sides have previously established red lines that are incompatible, including questions of whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine's army and whether the country will have any guarantee against further Russian aggression. As a condition for peace, the Russian leader wants Kyiv to give up the Donbas, the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the most intense fighting but that Russian forces have failed to capture completely. As part of a deal, Putin has said the United States and its European allies can provide Ukraine with a security guarantee resembling NATO’s collective defense pledge, according to a senior U.S. Zelenskyy has rejected Putin’s demand that Ukraine surrender the Donbas region, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, since the Ukrainian Constitution forbids giving up territory or trading land. French President Emmanuel Macron described Ukraine as an “outpost of our collective defense if Russia wanted to advance again.” “If we are weak with Russia today, we’ll be preparing the conflicts of tomorrow and they will impact the Ukrainians and — make no mistake — they can impact us, too.” Macron said Sunday. The European political heavyweights expected in Washington are Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Ukraine has in recent months been losing more territory against Russia’s bigger army, and Moscow’s forces breached Ukrainian lines in a series of minor infiltrations in the Donetsk region ahead of the Alaska summit.

Now, the heavy use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which let an operator see the target before striking, has turned areas up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line into kill zones. The growing use of FPVs has also made moving the wounded between points more difficult, said the commander of the 59th Brigade medical unit with call sign Buhor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons. Everything burns from those FPVs — everything, even tanks.” He explained that the munitions carry a charge from a rocket-propelled grenade — a shoulder-fired weapon that launches an explosive designed to pierce armored vehicles. When Artem Fursov arrived at the stabilization post late one night with three other soldiers, Buhor inspected his wounds and praised the bandage on his arm, asking who had done it. “And the Russians are coming in like it’s their own backyard.” Valentyn Pidvalnyi, a 25-year-old assault soldier wounded in the back by shrapnel, said that one month on the positions in 2022 was easier than trying to survive one day now as infantry. “It’s a very hard sector,” he said, “but if you don’t destroy them, they’ll take the tree line, then the town, then the whole region.” Buhor has worked in the Pokrovsk area since late 2022.

(AP Photo) ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- When 19-year-old Nigus Yosef told his parents he was going to leave home in Ethiopia’s Tigray region and try to get to Saudi Arabia, they begged him not to go. “They can’t even voice their sorrow.” Nigus Yosef is one of 132 missing from the boat that capsized this month; one of countless people from African countries gone missing on a journey in search of a new life. Senait Tadesse says that her 27-year-old daughter made it to Yemen, only to be held captive by kidnappers who communicated with Tadesse through Facebook, demanding a US$ 6,000 ransom to release her only child. Tadesse said in an interview with The Associated Press in the capital, Addis Ababa, that she sold her car and all her jewelry to raise the cash and deposited the money in an Ethiopian bank account. “Many young people no longer see a future for themselves within a nation that does not prioritize their needs,” explained Yared Hailemariam, an Ethiopian human rights advocate based in Addis Ababa. Young people are faced with a choice of either taking up arms to fight in endless conflicts, or providing for their families.” The war in Tigray was the reason why Nigus Yosef never finished school. After the boat capsized, a relative of one of the survivors managed to send a voice message to them from Saudi Arabia via the messaging app Imo, confirming that Eden’s dead body had been recovered. “The pain is truly overwhelming.” In response to the recent tragedy, the Ethiopian government issued a statement warning citizens “not to take the illegal route,” and to “avoid the services of traffickers at all cost,” while urging people to ”pursue legal avenues for securing opportunities.” But Girmachew Adugna, a migration scholar specializing in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, points out that legal migration channels are slow and time-consuming. “Young people often have little or no access to legal migration pathways, which leads them to migrate through irregular means.” More than 1.1 million Ethiopians were classified as migrants who left their home country and were living abroad in 2024, up from about 200,000 recorded in 2010, according to United Nations figures.

Article: Bolivians have headed to the polls for a pivotal election that could end the long reign of the leftist Movement Toward Socialism party Bolivia heads to the polls as its right-wing opposition eyes first victory in decades FILE - Bolivian presidential candidate Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga attends his campaign rally ahead of the upcoming presidential election, in La Paz, Bolivia, Aug. (AP Photo/Juan Karita, File) LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivians headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in presidential and congressional elections that could spell the end of the Andean nation's long-dominant leftist party and see a right-wing government elected for the first time in over two decades. With the nation’s worst economic crisis in four decades leaving Bolivians waiting for hours in fuel lines, struggling to find subsidized bread and squeezed by double-digit inflation, the opposition candidates are billing the race as a chance to alter the country’s destiny. “I have rarely, if ever, seen a situational tinderbox with as many sparks ready to ignite,” Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, founding partner of Aurora Macro Strategies, a New York-based advisory firm, writes in a memo. Breaking the MAS party's monopoly on political power, he adds, pushes “the country into uncharted political waters amid rising polarization, severe economic fragility and a widening rural–urban divide.” The outcome will determine whether Bolivia — a nation of about 12 million people with the largest lithium reserves on Earth and crucial deposits of rare earth minerals — follows a growing trend in Latin America, where right-wing leaders like Argentina’s libertarian Javier Milei, Ecuador’s strongman Daniel Noboa and El Salvador’s conservative populist Nayib Bukele have surged in popularity. Doria Medina and Quiroga have praised the Trump administration and vowed to restore ties with the United States — ruptured in 2008 when charismatic, long-serving former President Evo Morales expelled the American ambassador. After storming to office in 2006 at the start of the commodities boom, Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, nationalized the nation's oil and gas industry, using the lush profits to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure and improve the lives of the rural poor. After three consecutive presidential terms, as well as a contentious bid for an unprecedented fourth in 2019 that set off popular unrest and led to his ouster, Morales has been barred from this race by Bolivia's constitutional court. Rather than back the candidate widely considered his heir, Morales, holed up in his tropical stronghold and evading an arrest warrant on charges related to his relationship with a 15-year-old girl, has urged his supporters to deface their ballots or leave them blank. Doria Medina and Quiroga, familiar faces in Bolivian politics who both served in past neoliberal governments and have run for president three times before, have struggled to stir up interest as voter angst runs high. “There's enthusiasm for change but no enthusiasm for the candidates,” said Eddy Abasto, 44, a Tupperware vendor in Bolivia's capital of La Paz torn between voting for Doria Medina and Quiroga. “It's always the same, those in power live happily spending the country’s money, and we suffer.” Doria Medina and Quiroga have warned of the need for a painful fiscal adjustment, including the elimination of Bolivia’s generous food and fuel subsidies, to save the nation from insolvency. “Both candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures.” All 130 seats in Bolivia’s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house. If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct.

Paz, a former mayor who has sought to soften the edges of the opposition’s push for tough austerity to rescue Bolivia from a looming economic collapse, will face off against right-wing former President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, who finished second. “This economic model must change," Paz declared to crowds who cheered and chanted, “Renewal!" Paz’s campaign gained unexpected traction in recent weeks as he teamed up with Edman Lara, a social media savvy ex-police captain with evangelical backing whose supporters see him as a bold leader willing to stand up to corruption in the security forces. “Bolivia told the world that we want to live in a free nation.” The results delivered a stunning blow to Bolivia's hegemonic Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, which has governed Bolivia almost uninterrupted since its founder, charismatic ex-President Evo Morales, rose to power as part of the “pink tide” of leftist leaders that swept into office across Latin America during the commodities boom of the early 2000s. During his almost 14 years in power, Morales expanded the rights of the country’s Indigenous majority, defended coca growers against U.S.-backed eradication programs and poured natural gas profits into social programs. A power struggle between Morales and Arce fractured the bloc and handed the opposition its first real shot at victory in decades even as its uncharismatic candidates failed to unite. In perhaps the most visible sign of how fed up Bolivians are with the party, leftist politicians casting their ballots across Bolivia on Sunday faced barrages of boos, insults and thrown objects. Blocked from running by a court ruling on term limits, Morales has been holed up in his tropical stronghold of Chapare for months evading an arrest warrant for allegedly impregnating a 15-year-old girl while president. Whisked away by guards, Rodríguez later called it a “difficult moment.” The win for Paz came as a shock to a nation that had been conditioned by weeks of opinion polls to expect that the leading right-wing contenders, Quiroga and businessman Samuel Doria Medina, would capture the top two spots. Paz has sought to distance himself from pledges by Quiroga and Doria Medina to sell Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves to foreign companies and turn to the International Monetary Fund for billions of dollars of loans. “If they couldn’t govern well before, what makes us think they’ll do it now?” asked Yaitzel Poma, 30, referring to Paz’s right-wing rivals as she celebrated along the main avenue of Bolivia’s capital of La Paz on Sunday. “We want new people, new proposals, another chance for young people,” said 38-year-old Jaqueline Cachaca, a Paz supporter who lost her job at a bank this year amid a wave of layoffs and now sells street food. He's the son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, who began his political career as a co-founder of the Revolutionary Left Movement, a radical party persecuted under the bloody military dictatorship of Hugo Banzer in the 1970s, before striking a pact with Banzer’s right-wing party in order to become president from 1989 to 1993.

Article: Pakistani officials say they are expanding rescue and relief operations after flash floods killed more than 220 people in a single northwest district and destroyed homes, roads, and businesses By MUHAMMAD SAJJAD Associated Press and RIAZ KHAN Associated Press Local residents remove mud to recover vehicles from debris after Friday's flash flooding, in Mingora, the main town of Swat Valley, in Pakistan's northwest, Saturday, Aug. An emergency services spokesman in Buner, Mohammad Sohail, said more than half of the damaged roads in the district have been reopened, allowing vehicles and heavy machinery to reach isolated villages. In one of the deadliest incidents, 24 people from one family died in the village of Qadar Nagar when floodwaters swept through their home on the eve of a wedding. According to a government statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is monitoring the relief operations and has ordered faster distribution of aid, evacuation of stranded people, and intensified searches for the missing. The country also suffers regular flash floods and landslides during the monsoon season, which runs from June to September, particularly in the rugged northwest, where villages are often perched on steep slopes and riverbanks. In Kishtwar district, teams are continuing their efforts in the remote village of Chositi, looking for dozens of missing people after the area was hit by flash floods three days earlier.

Article: Iraqi officials have begun excavation of what is believed to be a mass grave left behind by the Islamic State extremist group during its rampage across the country a decade ago. (AP Photo/Khalid Mohammed, File) IRBIL, Iraq -- Iraqi officials have begun the excavation of what is believed to be a mass grave left behind by the Islamic State extremist group during its rampage across the country a decade ago. Local authorities are working with the judiciary, forensic investigations, Iraq’s Martyrs’ Foundation, and the directorate of mass graves to carry out the excavation of the site of a sink hole in al-Khafsa, south of the northern city of Mosul, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday. The war against IS officially ended in March 2019, when U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, which was the last sliver of land the extremists controlled. Rabah Nouri Attiyah, a lawyer who has worked on more than 70 cases of missing people in Nineveh, told the AP that information he obtained from the foundation and different Iraqi courts during his investigations points to Khasfa as “the largest mass grave in modern Iraqi history." Al-Asady, however, said investigators “cannot confirm yet if it is the largest mass grave” to be found in Iraq, “but according to the size of the space, we estimate it to be one of the largest.” Attiyah said roughly 70% of the human remains at Khasfa are believed to belong to Iraqi army and police personnel, with other victims including Yazidis. Testimonies and witness statements, as well as findings from other mass graves in Nineveh, indicate that most of the military, police and other security forces personnel killed by IS are expected to be found at Khasfa, along with Yazidis from Sinjar and Shiite victims from Tal Afar, he said.

Diane was taking part in a “school for husbands,” a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about “positive masculinity” in health and social issues and promote them in their communities. In Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health. Following his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed.” The program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality. The classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women’s access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants. “By educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital and helping with domestic work at home, you’re protecting people’s health,” Malick said.

The tech company said in a statement: “We’re pleased to resolve the ACCC’s concerns, which involved provisions that haven’t been in our commercial agreements for some time.” Commissioner chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb said: "Conduct that restricts competition is illegal in Australia because it usually means less choice, higher costs or worse service for consumers.” “Importantly, these changes come at a time when AI search tools are revolutionising how we search for information, creating new competition,” Cass-Gottlieb added. Last year, Telstra, Optus and their smaller rival TPG agreed to court-enforceable undertakings with the commission that they would not renew or make similar deals with Google to limit search options.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy -- Pope Leo XIV spent the last Sunday of his summer vacation with several dozen refugees, homeless and poor people and the church volunteers who help them, celebrating a special Mass for them and inviting them into the Vatican’s lakeside estate for a lunch of lasagna and roast veal. “And I encourage you not to distinguish between those who assist and those who are assisted, between those who seem to give and those who seem to receive, between those who appear poor and those who feel they have something to offer in terms of time, skills, and help,” he said. Former parishioners and church workers say he greatly reinforced the work of the local Caritas charity, opening soup kitchens and shelters for migrants and rallying funds to build oxygen plants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article: The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration Picketers march around the departures level at the Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, British Columbia, Sunday, Aug. (Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- The Canada Industrial Relations Board declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal Monday and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration. The strike at Canada's largest airline entered its third day on Monday and is affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season, and the two sides remain far apart on pay and other issues. “The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” the Canada Industrial Relations Board board, or CIRB, said in a written decision. The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labor laws, said the union needs to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties. CUPE national President Mark Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants. Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

(AP Photo/Esteban Felix) Actor Sebastián Solorza, who has Down syndrome and aims to run for president as an independent candidate, smiles during an interview at his home in Santiago, Chile, Thursday, July 31, 2025. 16, with the campaign so far defined by the mutual attacks between the two main contestants: The far-right José Antonio Kast, who lost to current leftist president Gabriel Boric in 2021, and Jeannette Jara, the ruling coalition’s communist nominee. While it's unlikely he will secure the necessary support to run for president — he has collected a little over 600 of the 35,000 signatures required — he sees his political foray as a success. On the streets of Huechuraba, a quiet and green neighborhood in the northern part of Chile's capital, Solorza is often greeted by supporters, fans, and workers from restaurants and cafés where he is a regular. “Let it be the people who ultimately decide our future.” Solorza's political aspirations open the door to “raise the voices of people with Down syndrome” and help to “demystify myths and prejudices still present in society,” said Carolina Gallardo, director of the Chilean nonprofit Down Up Foundation, which offers support and community for families raising children with Down syndrome. His mother, Jenny Solorza, recalls his early years as “very dark,” because doctors never provided a clear diagnosis for their son, leading them to search for information on their own. As a result, “Sebastián has a very broad musical culture, and that’s what he grew up with.” Solorza attended special schools where he developed his passion for the arts, fueled by music, rather than focusing on traditional academics. He later rose to national fame for his leading role as Tomy in the Chilean thriller “Chromosome 21.” The series, which follows a detective trying to determine if a young man found at a murder scene is a witness or a suspect, ranked second on Netflix in Chile just two days after its release in 2022.

The move in relation to the key White House meeting on Monday is an apparent effort to prevent a repeat of the heated encounter Zelenskyy faced when he met Trump in the Oval Office in February. The European leaders’ presence at Zelenskyy’s side, demonstrating Europe’s support for Ukraine, could potentially help ease concerns in Kyiv and in other European capitals that Zelenskyy risks being railroaded into a peace deal that Trump says he wants to broker with Russia. Von der Leyen, head of the European Union’s executive branch, posted on X that “at the request of President Zelenskyy, I will join the meeting with President Trump and other European leaders in the White House tomorrow.” In a quick succession Sunday, a stream of European leaders also announced that they'll be going.

Article: The Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval masterpiece depicting the 1066 Norman conquest of England, is set for a new chapter With the Bayeux Tapestry that tells of their long rivalry, France and Britain are making nice FILE - This photo taken Wednesday, Sept. The Bayeux Tapestry, with its scenes of sword-wielding knights in ferocious combat and King Harold of England's famous death, pierced by an arrow to an eye, has since the 11th century served as a sobering parable of military might, vengeance, betrayal and the complexity of Anglo-French relations, long seeped with blood and rivalry but also affection and cooperation. Now, the medieval forerunner of today's comic strips, commissioned as propaganda for the Normandy duke William known as “the Conqueror” after he took the English throne from Harold, is being readied for a new narrative mission. Next year, the fragile artistic and historic treasure will be gingerly transported from its museum in Bayeux, Normandy, to star in a blockbuster exhibition in London's British Museum, from September 2026 to July 2027. outing in almost 1,000 years will testify to the warming latest chapter in ties across the English Channel that chilled with the U.K.'s acrimonous departure from the European Union in 2020. Bayeux Museum curator Antoine Verney says the cross-Channel trip will be a home-coming of sorts for the tapestry, because historians widely believe that it was embroidered in England, using woolen threads on linen canvas, and because William's victory at the Battle of Hastings was such a major juncture in English history, seared into the U.K.'s collective consciousness. Moving an artwork so unwieldy — made from nine pieces of linen fabric stitched together and showing 626 characters, 37 buildings, 41 ships and 202 horses and mules in a total of 58 scenes — is further complicated by its great age and the wear-and-tear of time. Believed to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror’s half-brother, to decorate a new cathedral in Bayeux in 1077, the treasure is thought to have remained there, mostly stored in a wooden chest and almost unknown, for seven centuries, surviving the French Revolution, fires and other perils. Since then, only twice is the embroidery known to have been exhibited outside of the Normandy city: Napoleon Bonaparte had it shown off in Paris' Louvre Museum from late 1803 to early 1804. During World War II, it was displayed again in the Louvre in late 1944, after Allied forces that had landed in Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, of that year had fought onward to Paris and liberated it. But at the same time, this is a work that has already traveled extensively and been handled a great deal.” During the treasure's stay in the U.K., its museum in Bayeux will be getting a major facelift costing tens of millions of euros (dollars). 1 this year, with reopening planned for October 2027, when the embroidery will be re-housed in a new building, encased on an inclined 70-meter long table that Verney said will totally transform the viewing experience. “The studies required to allow its transfer to London and its exhibition at the British Museum are not finished, are under discussion, and are being carried out between the two governments,” Verney said. “How can one imagine, in my view, that the British Museum would risk damaging, through the exhibition, this work that is a major element of a shared heritage?” he asked.

Article: A federal judge is considering whether detainees have been denied their legal rights at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades MIAMI -- A federal judge will hear arguments Monday over whether detainees at a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades have been denied their legal rights. The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don’t have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. “The situation at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ is so anomalous from what is typically granted at other immigration facilities,” Eunice Cho, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said Thursday during a virtual meeting to prepare for Monday's hearing in Miami. But before delving into the core issues of the detainees’ rights, Ruiz has said he wants to hear about whether the lawsuit was filed in the proper jurisdiction in Miami. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district. “I think we should all be prepared that, before we get into any real argument about preliminary injunctive relief, that we at least spend some time working through the venue issues,” Ruiz said Thursday. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren't followed. The state's lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: North Carolina farmer Jamie Ager is part of a new crop of Democratic candidates the party is turning to as it tries to compete in the tough, often rural districts it may need to flip to retake the U.S. -- Jamie Ager has spent much of the past year rebuilding his 250-acre farm in the foothills of western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene tore through the region, cutting power, destroying fences and scattering livestock. Now, the fifth-generation farmer is running for Congress — part of a new crop of Democratic candidates the party is turning to as it tries to compete in the tough, often rural districts it may need to flip to retake the U.S. And in parts of North Carolina, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, the party is betting that kind of local credibility can cut through skepticism in places where the Democratic brand has fallen. Ager says he sees national Democrats as out of touch with rural life: too “academic” and “politically correct and scripted.” “That’s just not what people are interested in,” he says. But the execution of a lot of those ideas has been gummed up, you know, not well executed.” Heading into next year’s midterms, Democrats believe momentum is on their side. With power, water and telecommunications down due to last year's hurricane, Ager's Hickory Nut Gap farm became a hub for the community — hosting cookouts and using propane to grill food for neighbors. “We have to look in the mirror and say, ‘Let’s try something new.’” In a district where nearly 62% of residents live in very low-density areas, Barnette believes Ager’s identity — as a business owner, coach and father with deep local roots — could cut through. In the video launching his campaign, Ager shows flooding on the farm and is seen on the porch of his home, feeding chickens, driving a tractor and spending time with his wife and three sons. He’s buttoned-up and soft-spoken, with a long resume in elected office and deep roots in Kalamazoo, having served for a decade on the city commission before winning a seat in the state House in 2010. In a district anchored by conservative and religious values, Democrats see McCann as the kind of steady, experienced figure who can make inroads — especially as backlash builds to Trump’s tax bill, which includes deep spending cuts.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) FILE - Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguilar-Curry, D-Winters, talks with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, D-Hollister, as lawmakers discuss the state budget at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif., June 27, 2023. Here's a look at what's ahead for lawmakers in their last month in session: Lawmakers are expected to spend the first week back after summer break advancing the new congressional map at the urging of Gov. Newsom wants lawmakers to extend the program through 2045, commit $1 billion annually from the fund for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project and set aside $1.5 billion a year for state fire response. The proposal makes exceptions for officers wearing a medical grade mask, coverings designed to protect against exposure to smoke during a wildfire, and other protective gear used by SWAT officers while performing their duties. A first-in-the-nation state task force released a report in 2023 with more than 100 recommendations for how the state should repair historic wrongdoings against Black Californians descended from enslaved people. The California Legislative Black Caucus introduced a reparations package last year inspired by that work, but the measures did not include direct payments for descendants, and the most ambitious proposals were blocked.

(AP Photo/Marc Levy,File) FILE - Stacy Garrity, the Republican state treasurer of Pennsylvania, poses for photos at a campaign event at the Beerded Goat Brewing Co., Thursday, April 25, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa. Garrity said in a statement that she will "will bring jobs back, strengthen our economy and make Pennsylvania more affordable for families in every corner of the state.” Some top Pennsylvania Republicans support Garrity in the 2026 race for governor and hope she’ll see a clear primary field, although those hopes have been buffeted in recent weeks by 2022’s losing gubernatorial candidate, Doug Mastriano, suggesting that he'll run again. In campaign fundraising appeals, she accused Shapiro of being soft on law and order and hostile to her “pro-worker, pro-energy, pro-America agenda.” Shapiro has returned fire, blasting her for supporting President Donald Trump’s big tax break and spending cut package. Shapiro has won three statewide races, carries a reputation as a disciplined messenger and powerhouse fundraiser who spent more than $70 million alone in his sole campaign for governor, smashing Pennsylvania’s campaign finance record. He’s grown into a national figure after he made Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ shortlist for vice presidential running mates last year and is viewed as a potential White House contender for the party in 2028.

Article: As the Republican president pushes states to redraw their congressional districts to the GOP’s advantage, Democrats have shown they are willing to go beyond words of outrage and use whatever power they do have to win. Democrats in the Texas Legislature started it off by delaying, for now, Republican efforts to expand the GOP majority in the state's delegation and help preserve party control of the U.S. "For everyone who’s been asking, ‘Where is the fight?’ – well, here it is.” There is no guarantee Democrats can prevent the Republican-powered redistricting, just as Democrats on Capitol Hill have not been able to stop Trump’s moves. So far, progressive and establishment Democrats are aligned, uniting what has often been a fragmented opposition since Republicans led by Trump took control of the federal government with their election sweep in November. They can challenge his redistricting ploy with tangible moves as they also push back against the Republicans' tax and spending law and press the case that he is shredding American democracy. “We’ve been imploring Democrats where they have power on the state and local level to flex that power,” said Maurice Mitchell, who leads the Working Families Party at the left flank of mainstream U.S. “There’s been this overwrought talk about fighters and largely performative actions to suggest that they’re in the fight.” This time, he said, Democrats are “taking real risks in protecting all of our rights” against “an authoritarian president who only understands the fight.” Texas made sense for Republicans as the place to start a redistricting scuffle. Hochul dismissed Texas Republicans as “lawbreaking cowboys.” Newsom’s press office directed all-caps social media posts at Trump, mimicking his signature sign off: “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.” U.S. Then, with Texas bravado, Romero reached further into history: “We’re asking for help, maybe just as they did back in the days of the Alamo.” A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 15% of Democrats’ own voters described the party using words like “weak” or “apathetic.” An additional 10% called it “ineffective” or “disorganized.” Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who is raising money to support Texas Democrats, has encouraged Democratic-run statehouses to redraw districts now rather than wait for GOP states to act. The left “had its hair on fire” cheering those moments, O’Neill recalled, but were “left even more frustrated in the aftermath.” Trump still secured tax cuts for the wealthy, accelerated deportations and cut safety net programs, just as some of his controversial nominees were confirmed over vocal Democratic opposition. “Now,” O’Neill said, “there is some marriage of the rhetoric we’ve been seeing since Trump’s inauguration with some actual action.” O’Neill looked back wistfully to the decision by Senate Democrats not to eliminate the filibuster “when our side had the trifecta,” so a simple majority could pass major legislation.

(Chris Granger/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP, File) NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard. Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as “personal and intimate.” The first female mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment: The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working. Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.” Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail “due to COVID,” saying her travel accommodations were “a matter of safety, not of luxury.” The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha’s Vineyard. The pair used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” he said. She is also among more than 100 people brought up on corruption charges in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans two decades ago, said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a watchdog group that provided photographs and information to federal authorities in the latest case.

Among other big names to join Soho House's future leadership is actor and now tech investor Ashton Kutcher, who is set to join the company's board following the deal's completion. In a statement, Morse said that MCR had “long admired” Soho House and that its investment in the company “represents a strategic opportunity to combine our operational expertise with one of the most distinctive brands in hospitality.” Soho House CEO Andrew Carnie pointed to the club's growth over the years, and said that returning to private ownership will help the company “build on this momentum." Soho House's roots date back to 1995, starting with a single club in London opened by founder Nick Jones. Soho House describes itself as a “global membership platform of physical and digital spaces.” It bills its flagship clubs — which include spas, gyms and other luxury amenities — as a “home for creative people to come together and belong.” Known for attracting celebrities and other figures with deep pockets, membership fees often rack up to at least several thousand dollars a year. In earnings announced earlier this month, Soho House said had a total of it raked in $329.8 million in total revenues for its second fiscal quarter, an 8.9% jump year-over-year.

Article: Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding Republicans look to make a U-turn on federal commitment to electric vehicles for the Postal Service One of the U.S. “I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted," he said. A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.” Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force." She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract," Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense. “For now,” she added, "gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.” Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project "has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.” The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest" and not unexpected. “The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said. They do the best they can.” The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.” The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were "carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money. “It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle," he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.” ____ Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.

(Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) — Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration. Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada’s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak.” Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

Article: A judge has fined Qantas Airways $59 million for illegally firing over 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic MELBOURNE -- A judge on Monday fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for illegally firing more than 1,800 ground staff at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Australian Federal Court Justice Michael Lee said the outsourcing of 1,820 baggage handler and cleaner jobs at Australian airports in late 2020 was the “largest and most significant contravention” of relevant Australian labor laws in their 120-year history. Qantas agreed in December last year to pay AU$120 million ($78 million) in compensation to former staff after seven High Court judges unanimously rejected the Sydney-based airline’s appeal against the judgment that outsourcing their jobs was illegal. Lee ruled that the minimum fine to create a deterrence should be AU$90 million ($59 million), noting that Qantas executives had expected to save AU$125 million ($81 million) a year through outsourcing the jobs. “If any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,” Lee said. "I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,” Lee added. Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson, who was the airline's chief financial officer during the layoffs, said in a statement after Monday's decision: “We sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result.” “The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families," she said. Michael Kaine, national secretary of the union that represents 60,000 members, said he felt vindicated by Monday’s ruling, which ends a five-year legal battle that Qantas had been widely expected to win. “It is a significant — the most significant — industrial outcome in Australia’s history and it sends a really clear message to Qantas and to every employer in Australia: Treat your work force illegally and you will be held accountable,” Kaine told reporters. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a consumer watchdog, sued the airline in the Federal Court alleging that Qantas engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights from May 2021 through to July 2022 that had already been canceled.

AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) NEW YORK -- Target and Ulta Beauty are parting ways, ending a partnership launched in 2021 that created in-store shops filled with beauty products at hundreds of the discounter's stores. “For 35 years, Ulta Beauty has revolutionized how people experience beauty — bringing together an unmatched assortment from mass to luxury — and our partnership with Target was one of many unique ways we have brought the power of beauty to guests nationwide,” said Amiee Bayer-Thomas, chief retail officer of Ulta Beauty, in a statement. Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Target, said in a statement he was committed to "offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target.” The partnership was announced in 2020 and came as the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping habits and more people tried to minimize potential exposure to the virus through one-stop shopping. “It’s a combination of two winning retailers that have great momentum in the market that can redefine the category,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told The Associated Press back in 2020. The announcement comes as Target is struggling to regain its footing with its shoppers who are pulling back on discretionary items and are shopping at other rivals that they believe to be lower price or offer better merchandise.

(Sammy Kogan/The Canadian Press via AP) TORONTO -- Canada’s government forced Air Canada and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration Saturday after a work stoppage stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike — and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene. The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada’s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract. “It is all because of the incredible dependency of Canadians.” Last year, the government forced the country’s two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. “With valuable cargo grounded and passengers stranded, the government made the right decision to refer the two sides to binding arbitration," said Matthew Holmes, the executive vice president for the Chamber of Commerce — adding that “close to a million Canadians and international visitors could be impacted" if it takes Air Canada a week to be fully operational again. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full “due to the summer travel peak." Many travelers expressed frustration over Air Canada's response to the strike. “What’s stressful is to not hear anything from Air Canada,” said Reyt, who is trying to return to Montreal, where he is an associate professor of organizational behavior at McGill University. He said he only received one email from the airline on Thursday warning of potential strike disruptions, but had no further information as of Saturday evening in Cannes, where he was visiting family. She has been trying to help her brother and cousin get home to Edmonton, Alberta since the second leg of their Air Canada trip was canceled during what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover in Montreal on Friday night. “We hope that Air Canada lifts the lockout and negotiates fairly.” Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada’s flight attendants. “I think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,” he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't "a way just to silence them.” Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans but we cannot work for free," Natasha Stea, an Air Canada flight attendant and local union president, said before the government intervention was announced. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space. “Imagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.” More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness — or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.

While that technology is still decades away, control over the moon in the intervening years could determine which countries emerge as superpowers, according to Joseph Rooke, a London-based cybersecurity expert who has worked in the U.K. The end of the Cold War temporarily halted a lot of investments in space, but competition is likely to increase as the promise of mining the moon becomes a reality. “If you dominate Earth’s energy needs, that’s game over.” China and Russia have announced plans for their own nuclear plants on the moon in the coming years, while the U.S. to stop spreading irresponsible rhetoric, stop expanding military build-up in space, and make due contribution to upholding the lasting peace and security in space.” Nations are scrambling to create their own rocket and space programs to exploit commercial prospects and ensure they aren't dependent on foreign satellites.

Article: The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people — followed closely by Hurricane Rita. On Louisiana’s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state’s 2029 coastal master plan. The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been “dying for over a century” because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said. In Bayou La Batre, Alabama — a fishing village built in the late 1700s — The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. Such efforts won't prevent all land losses, but in Louisiana, “cumulatively, they could make a big difference," said Denise Reed, a research scientist who is working on Louisiana's coastal master plan. “It could buy us some time.” On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time. Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt. That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California's most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley. Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities. But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. The Corps rebuilt beaches, dunes and human-made structures from Massachusetts to Virginia and now is turning to areas farther inland that are increasingly vulnerable to more powerful storm surges, Cresitello said.

By around 2.6 million years ago, early humans had developed a method of pounding rocks together to chip off sharp flakes that could be used as blades for butchering meat. “But hippo skin is really tough" — and not all rocks were suitable for creating blades sharp enough to pierce hippo skin, said co-author Thomas Plummer, a paleoanthropologist at Queens College of the City University of New York. Co-author Emma Finestone of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History added: “When we think about stone tools, not every rock is equal in terms of the quality of tools.” At the Nyayanga site, researchers found durable blades made of quartzite, a rock material that they traced to streambeds and other locations around 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. This is probably the earliest time we have in the archaeological record an indication of that behavior,” said Eric Delson, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.

Article: WhatsApp has taken down 6.8 million accounts linked to criminal scam centers worldwide, according to its parent company, Meta NEW YORK -- WhatsApp has taken down 6.8 million accounts that were “linked to criminal scam centers” targeting people online around that world, its parent company Meta said this week. In a Tuesday announcement, Meta said it was also rolling new tools on WhatsApp to help people spot scams — including a new safety overview that the platform will show when someone who is not in a user’s contacts adds them to a group, as well as ongoing test alerts to pause before responding. Meta, which also owns Facebook and Instagram, pointed to recent scam efforts that it said attempted to use its own apps — as well as TikTok, Telegram and AI-generated messages made using ChatGPT — to offer payments for fake likes, enlist people into a pyramid scheme and/or lure others into cryptocurrency investments.

(AP Photo/Themba Hadebe, File) BRISBANE, Australia -- Cricketer Shane Warne's legacy lives on more than three years after the death of the great spin bowler from a heart attack at the age of 52. The research published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology on Friday showed almost seven out of 10 (68.9%) had at least one uncontrolled risk factor for heart disease. Warne revived and elevated the art of leg-spin bowling when he emerged on the international scene in the 1990s and was a central character in one of Australia’s most successful eras in the sport. The charity’s chief executive described the results as “bittersweet.” “We’re proud to have helped thousands take their heart health seriously but we know there’s still work to do,” Nolan said.

(Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP) Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today. The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. “There are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable," said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution. But “If you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,” Enck said. “Those two things cannot get recycled together." The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an “all-of-the-above approach.” He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents," said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute. Because of this, Kaufman says, “The aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.” “Reuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,” Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.

Article: “This documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.” Directed by Chris Smith, “Devo” uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young. Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones’ “I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which earned them a crucial slot on “Saturday Night Live.” On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from “Ghostbusters.” They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, “Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,” in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980’s “Freedom of Choice,” which featured “Whip It,” a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of “devolution.” “We were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the ’50s and ’60s.” Casale says in the movie. “What we saw was regression.” The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks — portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie “Metropolis.” “We had a meta-approach,” Casale tells the AP. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.” Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The song “Whip It” was written after reading Thomas Pynchon’s 760-page postmodern sci-fi tome “Gravity’s Rainbow.” The video — featuring cowboys drinking beer, dangerous gunplay and assault — was actually mocking President Ronald Reagan and his macho brand of conservatism. Members of Devo — which also included Mark's brother, Bob, Gerald's brother, Bob, and Alan Myers — performed on TV and chatted with talk show hosts like David Letterman but their satire never seemed never to break through. “Nobody wanted to hear us talking about the duality of human nature and the dangers of groupthink and the atrophication of people being able to think logically and think critically,” Casale says. “The only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn’t seem to have done that in the past,” Mothersbaugh tells the AP. “I always tried to be optimistic that devolution was something that was going to be corrected and that our message would be not necessary at this point, but unfortunately it’s more real than ever.” After Devo, Casale directed music videos and commercials, while Mothersbaugh scored movies and TV shows such as “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse,” “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,” “Rugrats” and “Hello Tomorrow!” There are signs of optimism when members of Devo play live these days. But there’s also, there’s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it’s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.” Devo are set to hit the road later this year in a co-headlining tour with the B-52's.

Article: (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, file) LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA. His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's “The Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," the second of his two BAFTA nominations. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable — more human — element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since. Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021’s “Last Night in Soho,” remembered the actor in an Instagram post as “kind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.” “The closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. He got his break with “Billy Budd” and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the “angry young men” movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking. That was perhaps most notable in the 1965 adaptation of John Fowles’ creepy debut novel “The Collector,” where he played the awkward and lonely Freddie Clegg, who kidnapped Samantha Eggar’s Miranda Grey in a warped attempt to win her love. “And he said to me, ‘You should always study your voice.’” Stamp then segued into a spot-on Olivier impersonation, continuing, “‘Because, as you get older, your looks go, but your voice will become empowered.’” His career took a bit of a hiatus from the late 1960s after he missed out on the role of James Bond to replace Sean Connery, that included a years-long stint in India and which saw him embrace a more holistic approach to his self. He played John Tunstall in 1988's “Young Guns,” the Galactic Republic leader in 1999's “Star Wars” prequel “The Phantom Menace,” appeared in the comedies “Yes Man” and “Get Smart” in 2008 and delivered voice performances in the video games “Halo 3” and “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.” Born in London’s East End on July 22, 1938, Stamp lived a colorful life, particularly during the 1960s when he had a string of romances, including with actress Julie Christie and model Jean Shrimpton.

Pictures via AP) LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Weapons” scared its way to the top of the box office in its debut and managed to stay there during its second weekend, beating out “Freakier Friday” and newcomer “Nobody 2.” Zach Cregger's horror film earned $25 million in 3,450 North American theaters, a 43% drop from its first weekend. “August came on strong last year, so it makes comparisons tough,” Dergarabedian said, noting the box office success of movies like “Deadpool and Wolverine” and the horror sci-fi “Alien: Romulus” that premiered this time last year. “It’s just that eclectic mix of films with appeal to every demographic.” “Nobody 2” follows the pandemic success of the first in the series, “Nobody," which was released in 2021. Jim Orr, president of domestic distributions at Universal Pictures, said he hopes the movie's reaction scores — an 89% Audience score and B+ CinemaScore — point “to a long and successful run at the domestic box office.” “The Fantastic Four: First Steps" took the fourth spot during its fourth weekend in theaters, bringing in $8.8 million domestically.

(Enrico Nawrath/Bayreuth Festival via AP) BAYREUTH, Germany -- In Wagner's home theater, a twist has been added to the classic opera “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.” Instead of Walther joining the guild of master singers and preparing to marry Eva after he wins the song contest, in Bayeuth's new version she grabs the medal out of the young knight's hands, returns it to her father, then leads her future husband offstage for a future forsaking the traditions of their family and city. Sixtus Beckmesser, the petulant town clerk who loses the song contest to Walther, pulls the plug on the cow, which darkens and sags, during the final oration defending the imperative of German art by the cobbler Hans Sachs. Davids' ending is less jarring than Kasper Holten’s 2017 Covent Garden staging, set in a men's club where Eva is horrified Walther would want to join the misogynistic Meistersingers and runs away in tears. “I really felt like in this production Eva and Walther truly had a fun connection — fun, young, loving connection — and I just leaned into that and listened to Spyres' beautiful tenor,” Nilsson said. Davids' contrast was sharp from Barrie Kosky's 2017 production, set partly in Wagner's home of Wahnfried and the Nuremberg trials courtroom, with Walther and Sachs portrayed as Wagner of various ages. Beckmesser, played fussily but without histrionics by Michael Nagy, had a shimmering silver sweater below a cream Trachten jacket, mirror sunglasses and lute transformed to resemble a heart-shaped electric guitar outlined by pink light that gave him an Elvis Presley look. She was amused.” Edwards, the set designer, had orange and yellow spears of light that resemble fairgrounds and included architectural details from the Bayreuth auditorium such as circular lamps in sets of three in the church and seats like the ones the audience was viewing from.

Article: Filmmaker Kate Beecroft points her lens toward the real cowgirls of the Badlands in the lyrical new film “East of Wall.” The film blends fact and fiction to tell a story about the working women of South Dakota, skilled riders and trainers with ranching and rodeo in their blood who also can't seem to catch a break. There are a few Hollywood actors in the mix, including Jennifer Ehle as a hard living grandmother with a lifetime of regrets as well as some nuggets of wisdom and Scoot McNairy as an out-of-towner who wants to acquire the land, but most of the cast are non-actors playing themselves. At the heart of “East of Wall,” now playing in select theaters, is Tabatha Zimiga, a South Dakota native whose ability to tame wild horses is the stuff of legend in the area. But the effects of the loss are still felt, especially for their daughter Porshia (played by her real-life daughter Porshia Zimiga), whose grief is threatening to turn into hate of her mother. It's reminiscent of Linda Manz’s narration in “Days of Heaven.” “East of Wall” is best when it’s capturing the landscapes and the girls in action, riding and filming energetic TikToks of their friends racing cars on horseback. The real-life drama of financial instability is compelling and likely rooted in truth; however, the introduction of McNairy’s suspect Texan feels like a narrative contrivance and drama for drama’s sake. A native of Los Angeles who’d worked as an actress and production designer, Beecroft felt stalled and hopped in a truck with her friend and cinematographer Austin Shelton to find the stories of everyday Americans.

Article: Texas Democrats have ended a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan no-holds-barred fight over President Donald Trump’s desire to reshape United States House district maps to his advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation – reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu in a statement on Monday. The return of Texas Democrats to the Republican-run Congress in the Lone Star State comes as California Democrats advance a countereffort to redraw their congressional boundaries in retaliation – a tit-for-tat that puts the nation’s two most populous states at the centre of an expanding battle over control of the US Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny their Republican-majority colleagues the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Capitol Hill. The US president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Texas Governor Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people earlier this summer.

Article: -- Louisiana sued the online gaming platform Roblox on Thursday, alleging the wildly popular site has perpetuated an environment where sexual predators "thrive, unite, hunt and victimize kids." The lawsuit, filed in state court by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox has failed to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from adult predators. "Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety." The company has faced lawsuits and backlash for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services. Last month, a lawsuit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. "While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards - such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing - to help protect our community," the company added. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users." The free online gaming platform has more than 111 million monthly users. Its website describes Roblox as "the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine." Roblox doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information, such as phone numbers. Roblox, which according to its website has "a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors," doesn't allow children under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission. The company says on its website that age verification "is a new feature that is currently in testing on Roblox." Last month, it launched a feature that requires teenagers aged 13 to 17 to send a video selfie to verify their ages if they want to chat freely with people they know, called "trusted connections." Amid mounting criticism in recent months, the company has implemented additional measures that it says will keep their young users safe. Roblox said the system led it to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine’s future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. WATCH: What to expect from Zelenskyy’s next meeting with Trump, backed by European leaders By coming as a group, they hope to avoid debacles like Zelenskyy’s February meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump chastised him for not showing enough gratitude for U.S. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin. Zelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe. European heavyweights in Washington Planning to join Zelenskyy in Washington are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.” The European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official. WATCH: Security expert analyzes fallout of Trump’s alignment with Putin after their summit The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. Ahead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump.” He separately lashed out at the Wall Street Journal and other outlets “who truly don’t have a clue, tell me everything that I am doing wrong on the Russia/Ukraine MESS.” Following the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin. ‘A very big move’ European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.

Article: States are moving to send hundreds of members of their National Guard to the nation’s capital to assist in the Trump administration’s takeover of the city’s police department Members of the District of Columbia National Guard patrol along the National Mall, Saturday, Aug. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) WASHINGTON -- Three states moved to deploy hundreds of members of their National Guard to the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. The moves announced Saturday came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of D.C.,” and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation.” Trump was at his Virginia golf club after Friday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. “I can’t believe that this is happening in this country at this time.” Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreach and that he had used crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. “Hopefully, some of the mayors and some of the residents will get out in front of it and try and make it harder for it to happen in other cities,” Finnigan said. Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, said she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for the safety or her students given the “unmarked officers of all types” now roaming Washington and detaining people. Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 of his state's National Guardsmen and Ohio Gov Mike DeWine said his state would send 150 military police at the request of the U.S. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard “stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region” and that the troops' “unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.” Federal agents have appeared in some of the city’s most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. On Friday, the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an “emergency police commissioner” after the district’s top lawyer sued to contest. In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government’s failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.” In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” She added that if Washington residents stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy — even when we don’t have full access to it.” ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article After a man was struck and killed by a SUV Thursday while running from a federal immigration enforcement operation at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, immigrant communities are once again condemning the federal government’s tactics while mourning the crash victim. The man who died on the 210 Freeway was identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Jutiapa, Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which said the Guatemalan consulate had confirmed the identity. Cellphone video from the deadly crash appears to show a passerby on the 210 Freeway, showing the body of a man who has been hit by a car just yards from where federal officers were arresting day laborers below. I don’t think that is the case, but it ended up with a father, a brother being killed,” said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. “Whether they were chasing him or not, the fact is that when you have operations of this kind, the first reaction of any human being is to run.” Many others in the same Home Depot parking lot also ran, according to people who witnessed or experienced the raid. “Some people ran regardless of their immigration status because nowadays, they don’t know if undocumented or documented people will be detained.” Mattias said he hurt himself while jumping a fence.

Article: Ruben Amorim was 55 seconds into a post-match news conference that lasted less than three-and-a-half minutes at Old Trafford on Sunday when he was asked a question that made him flinch back and raise his eyebrows in disbelief. It concerned his goalkeeper and whether he had given any consideration to picking veteran former England man Tom Heaton ahead of Altay Bayindir for the Premier League defeat by Arsenal. Events can change situations quickly when a transfer window is nearing its close and it has been established Andre Onana's former club Inter Milan are looking at bringing in a new goalkeeper. When it became apparent Gianluigi Donnarumma was likely to be available as he is no longer required at Paris St Germain, the word coming out of Old Trafford was the Italian goalkeeper would not be heading their way. After all, it couldn't have been any clearer who his first choice was when the 29-year-old was picked for the Europa League final in May even though he had made high-profile mistakes in the build-up to the defeat by Tottenham in Bilbao. However, while Amorim said in his pre-match news conference on Friday afternoon the Cameroon international was available to face Mikel Arteta's side, by kick-off, he had only three full training sessions behind him after suffering a hamstring injury early in July. In Onana's absence, Amorim thought Bayindir had performed well during a summer campaign across three countries in which United remained unbeaten and the 27-year-old had featured in three-and-a-half of the five games. It was on that basis Amorim concluded in order for players to believe his 'group' philosophy, it would be the wrong decision to axe Bayindir, who in his eyes had done nothing to deserve it, for Onana, whose fitness had to be taken on trust.

Article: Two days after Donald Trump’s failed summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on Fox News and raised a familiar point about the Trump administration’s position. Rubio added, “Ukraine is going to have to accept things it doesn’t like, and Russia is going to have to accept things that it doesn’t like.” On CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” the secretary made a similar point, though host Margaret Brennan pressed him on a key detail that too often goes unsaid. Brennan asked about the potential for a “dangerous precedent” that the United States “now accepts this concept that it is OK to seize land by force.” Rubio responded that Putin “has already seized land by force,” which was true, but which was also beside the point. “Are you demanding withdrawal?” the host asked, leading Rubio to respond: “In order to have a deal here to reach the end of this conflict, both sides are going to have to make concessions. Olga Rudenko, the editor in chief of the Kyiv Independent in Ukraine, has a new opinion piece in The New York Times with a straightforward headline: “All Russia Needs to Do Is Go Home.” From the column: The meeting between Mr. For all of the complexities surrounding possible territorial “swaps,” security guarantees and diplomatic partnerships, there’s a far more straightforward solution just sitting there, waiting for attention: Putin could withdraw his forces from Ukraine. Trump has spent months insisting that Putin wants “peace,” and the Republican reiterated the point to Fox News’ Sean Hannity after his failed summit in Alaska, saying that he genuinely believes that the Russian dictator wants to “solve the problem.” But this doesn’t have to be complicated: All Putin has to do is decide to stop fighting the war he started. Ukraine proved to be far more formidable than Russia expected; Russia has paid a heavy price for its miscalculation; and Russia could decide — literally at any time — to simply end the unprovoked conflict.

Article: Former national security adviser explains toggle caption Mstyslav Cherno/AP/AP President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Going into his Alaska summit last week, Trump said the main goal was to negotiate a ceasefire deal, and he warned of "severe consequences" for Russia if that deal wasn't reached. The united front is posed to prevent a repeat of Zelenskyy's last visit to the White House, but it's also an opportunity to ensure Ukraine has a say in the negotiations. But the real question is, is President Trump actually looking for a true peace agreement or is he effectively taking President Putin's side and saying it's Ukraine that has to make a whole series of concessions? It's interesting to me that there is more nervousness around Zelenskyy coming than there was around Putin coming when Zelenskyy is supposed to be a friend, and we know that Putin is a foe. Fadel: What about this concession they say they did get, that they could offer security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again, something they say Putin has agreed to and they called it 'game changing?' Sullivan: Well, security guarantees are absolutely essential because over the long term, what Putin really wants is the subjugation of Ukraine. Sullivan: Well, President Biden took the position, which President Trump has also taken, that the United States will not directly enter the war against Russia with American forces on the ground. If President Trump, alongside Europe, really cranked up the economic pressure on Russia at a moment when their economy is weak, I do believe it would create more leverage to get a good deal, a true peace in Ukraine. And if you look at the Russian economic official speaking publicly about how their war machine is sputtering, now is the moment, in my view, to really tighten the pressure, especially with oil prices being where they are globally.

Article: The conservative cable news channel Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the voting machine company Dominion over baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, according to a new regulatory filing. The timing was striking: Right around the time that Trump announced a renewed crusade against voting machines, based in part on his conspiratorial assumptions about the election equipment, the public learned of Newsmax’s settlement with one of the nation’s leading voting machine companies. It was just four months ago when a judge ruled that the far-right media outlet did, in fact, make defamatory statements about Dominion Voting Systems when it falsely claimed the company rigged votes in the 2020 presidential election, concluding that Dominion had presented “clear and convincing evidence” that the statements from Newsmax were false and would “likely cause reasonable viewers to think significantly less favorably about Dominion than if the viewers knew the truth.” That set the stage for a trial, at which point a jury would have decided whether the cable channel acted with “actual malice.” But it also opened the door to settlement negotiations, which apparently ended in an agreement. Finally, let’s not forget there’s still one big case pending: Fox News is facing a $2.7 billion lawsuit from Smartmatic, and as The New York Times reported, that case is set to proceed to trial in a Manhattan state court unless the parties reach a settlement.

Link: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/newsmax-to-pay-67m-in-defamation-case-over-false-2020-election-claims
Article: DENVER (AP) — The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday. The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network. “We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.” WATCH: Fox News to pay $787M settlement to Dominion Voting Systems over stolen election lies A spokesperson for Dominion said the company was pleased to have settled the lawsuit. The disclosure of the settlement came as Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies. The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were bogus. “How long are we going to play along with election fraud?” Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election was called for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion’s earlier defamation case against Fox News also revealed how the network’s business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage of Trump’s 2020 election claims. Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order attacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a series targeting law firms Trump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey’s work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats said Monday that they were ending a two-week walkout that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts as part of a national partisan brawl over President Donald Trump’s desire to reshape U.S. Their return will allow the Republican-run Legislature to proceed as California Democrats advance a counter-effort to redraw their congressional boundaries in retaliation — a tit-for-tat that puts the nation’s two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state more than two weeks ago to deny their Republican-majority colleagues the attendance necessary to vote on redrawn maps intended to send five more Texas Republicans to Washington. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu in a statement. The president wants to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms during his first presidency, when Democrats regained House control and used their majority to stymie his agenda and twice impeach him. Greg Abbott jumped to the president’s aid, adding redistricting to the agenda of an initial special session agenda that included a number of issues, but most notably a package of bills responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: The attorneys say that hearings for their cases have been routinely canceled in federal Florida immigration courts by judges who say they don’t have jurisdiction over the detainees held in the Everglades. At the start of Monday’s hearing, government attorneys said they would designate the immigration court at the Krome North Service Processing Center in the Miami area as having jurisdiction over the detention center in the Everglades in an effort to address some of the civil rights attorneys’ constitutional concerns. The state and federal government defendants have argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility was built is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district. But Ruiz also questioned whether the case against the state defendants might be better in the middle district, because all of the purported civil rights violations occurred at the facility itself, which is located in Collier County, several miles outside the southern district. The hearing over legal access comes as another federal judge in Miami considers whether construction and operations at the facility should be halted indefinitely because federal environmental rules weren’t followed. The state’s lawyers said that since July 15, when videoconferencing started at the facility, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, and in-person meetings started July 28.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukraine’s future could hinge on a hastily assembled meeting Monday at the White House as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brings an extraordinary group of European leaders to show U.S. The European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, and they want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. The meetings are also a test of America’s relationship with its closest allies after the European Union and United Kingdom accepted Trump’s tariff hikes partly because they wanted his support on Ukraine. The night before the meeting, however, Trump seemed to put the onus on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions and suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy appeared to respond with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” The sitdown in Alaska yielded the possible contours for stopping the war in Ukraine, though it was unclear whether the terms discussed would ultimately be acceptable to Zelenskyy or Putin.

Ramsey certainly looks like a Howe player and the versatile midfielder was even ranked second for possessions won (15) in the final third for Aston Villa in the top-flight last season. Newcastle may be well-stocked in the middle of the park, but the 24-year-old's athleticism, ball-carrying ability and experience in the Premier League and Champions League will be invaluable as the club prepare to fight on four fronts. Ramsey registered just six goal involvements in the top-flight last season, but Callum Rowe recalled how his friend "always had an eye for scoring" after the pair came through the ranks together at Aston Villa. "With my Villa head on, I'd rather see him at Villa still, but he's going to a Champions League team and a big, well-supported club so I wish him well.

Article: 16 episode of “Velshi.” Last week, Donald Trump essentially took control of Washington, D.C.’s law enforcement, activating the National Guard, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to carry out what he calls an effort to crack down on crime in the city. The District of Columbia was established by the Constitution, carved out of Maryland and Virginia, as an explicitly neutral site to conduct government business that would not be a part of or beholden to any one state. with troops, we’re seeing the consequences of allowing a city of over 700,000 people — more than Boston, Detroit or Atlanta — to be deprived of the basic rights of self-governance and political representation that most of us take for granted.

Article: She was charged in the spring with allegedly assaulting federal officers at an immigration facility in Newark, New Jersey, while she was conducting oversight with other Democratic politicians amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. “The Department of Justice’s dismissal of prosecutions arising from the January 6 attack on the Capitol — including those of more than 160 defendants charged with violating the same statute upon which the indictment relies here — is robust evidence of unconstitutional differential treatment,” her lawyers wrote. They observed that the congresswoman’s alleged conduct was “manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray.” “There is a simple difference between this prosecution of Congresswoman McIver and the 160 cases involving assault against federal officers on January 6 that the Justice Department has dismissed: it is all about politics and partisanship,” her lawyers wrote, calling the differential treatment “precisely what the Constitution forbids.” The filing is a sobering reminder of the violence of Jan. 6 and what it says about an administration that made it a Day One priority to forgive scores of convictions (by way of clemency) and pending charges (by way of dismissals). Seeking to clear that high bar in her case, McIver, who pleaded not guilty, maintains that the DOJ “cannot pursue charges against her because she is a Democrat who conducts oversight of Executive Branch immigration policy, while dismissing charges brought under the same statute against those whose views they share and who engaged in conduct far more egregious.” The fate of McIver’s case doesn’t hinge on the success of this single motion. She filed it alongside others, including one that seeks to dismiss her case based on legislative immunity, in which her lawyers wrote that she’s charged in connection with “a congressionally authorized oversight inspection.” Legislative immunity is distinct from the presidential immunity that Trump won from the Supreme Court in his Jan. United States and its separation of powers rationale, her lawyers wrote in the immunity motion that the court’s reasoning in Trump’s case “applies with at least as much force in the context of legislative immunity,” given the latter doctrine’s concern with ensuring legislative independence.

Article: Hurricane Erin: No direct hit forecast on U.S., but flood risks prompt evacuations toggle caption National Weather Service, NOAA/ Screenshot by NPR Hurricane Erin is spinning toward the Bahamas and the U.S. It will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip currents" at beaches along much of the East Coast for the next several days, the National Hurricane Center says — and expectations of dangerous flooding are triggering evacuation orders. Erin isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but forecasters at the National Weather Service office in Morehead City, N.C., warn that areas such as North Carolina's Outer Banks should be prepared for waves as high as 15 to 20 feet or more — and to expect days of potential flooding. Sponsor Message "Coastal flooding will likely be a long duration issue, impacting Highway 12," the NWS office said, warning that parts of the main highway running along the Outer Banks could be impassible for several days. The North Carolina transportation department said a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for all visitors to Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands, adding that the order will take effect for residents early Tuesday. Officials in Hyde County, N.C., issued a state of emergency for Ocracoke Island, warning that emergency vehicles would not be able to use Highway 12 to reach and transport people in distress. The Turks and Caicos Islands were seeing waves of over 10 feet and sea swells of 8 to 12 feet, "occasionally reaching up to 17 feet this morning," the Turks and Caicos Islands National Weather Service said on Monday. The islands began the day under a tropical storm warning as Erin began to move past them to the north; the weather agency also issued a flood warning due to heavy rain. and nearby territories, Erin is raising the risk of tall waves and dangerous rip currents along the eastern coastline from Florida to Massachusetts as it moves northward, forecasters said on Monday. The Category 4 storm's core "is expected to pass to the east of the southeastern Bahamas today and move between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States by the middle of the week," the NHC said. There are signs that the season may now be ramping up: The hurricane center says it's monitoring a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic that could develop into a storm over the next week.

Article: Russia’s illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 was quick and bloodless, and it sent Moscow’s relations with the West into a downward spiral unseen since the Cold War. Putin has called the peninsula “a sacred place” and has prosecuted those who publicly argue it is part of Ukraine — particularly the Crimean Tatars, who strongly opposed the annexation. There was abundant evidence to the contrary, including a Dutch court’s finding that a Russia-supplied air defense system shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. WATCH: What to expect from Zelenskyy’s next meeting with Trump, backed by European leaders Russian hard-liners later criticized Putin for failing to capture all of Ukraine that year, arguing it was easily possible at a time when the government in Kyiv was in disarray and its military in shambles. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, when both were part of the USSR, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Moscow and Kyiv. Russia kept a foot in the door, however: Its Black Sea Fleet had a base in the city of Sevastopol, and Crimea — as part of Ukraine — continued to host it. A top Russian military official later said that securing a land corridor from Russia to Crimea by holding the occupied parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions was among the key goals of what the Kremlin called its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The attacks targeted the Russian Black Sea Fleet there, as well as ammunition depots, air fields and Putin’s prized asset — the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia, which was struck in October 2022, in July 2023 and in June 2025. Those also include Ukraine ceding the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022, dropping its bid to join NATO, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population.

But Davis said he would leave it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. “Faced with these rulings and other constraints, Newsmax chose to settle the case.” “Newsmax has always maintained that its reporting was not defamatory and that its coverage was consistent with accepted journalistic standards,” the company said. Davis also handled the Dominion-Fox News case, and made a similar ruling that the network repeated numerous lies by Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despite internal communications showing Fox officials knew the claims were false. Though Trump has insisted his fraud claims are real, there’s no evidence to prove they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time.

Article: The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) has said Air Canada’s ongoing strike, in which 10,000 cabin crew members have walked off their jobs, is illegal after strikers ignored orders to return to work. Pushing for a resolution, Carney said, “We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our countries are being disrupted by this action.” The airline normally carries 130,000 people daily during the ongoing peak summer travel season and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines. The minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of the Parliament of Canada, which are on break until September 15. “The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector-workers who may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations School. The previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.

Article: TEL AVIV — In the plaza that Israelis have christened “Hostage Square,” hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government. Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave’s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive. Among the demonstrators at Sunday’s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. “Life comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.” The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians’ homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. While Sunday’s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed. “Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas’s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a “toxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.” Their government’s approach appears to have the backing of Trump.

Speaking to the New Left Review, Sultana praised Corbynism's mass appeal, but said he "capitulated" to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, saying it "equates it with anti-Zionism". Asked how the new party would adapt the model of radical politics Corbynism set out a decade ago, Sultana said he had made "a serious mistake" in being too conciliatory. "It capitulated to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which famously equates it with anti-Zionism, and which even its lead author Kenneth Stern has now publicly criticised." Sultana added the movement was "frightened and far too conciliatory" when it was attacked and should have recognised that the state and the media "are our class enemies" because, she said, "you cannot give these people an inch". "Exaggerating his role is a tactic to give undue weight to his controversial views." Mr Hearn added he hoped Sultana would "remain on the fringes of politics for the remainder of her career, which is where her extremist views belong". The vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Andrew Gilber, said the definition was also "supported by the overwhelming majority of British Jews as it is clear and measured in defining antisemitism". "Those who seek to delegitimise and mis-define the IHRA definition in this way prove themselves to be no friend to the Jewish community and also call into question their wider commitment to anti-racism, the wellbeing of the Jewish community and social cohesion."

Article: 'SNL' castmember Bowen Yang shares a piece of 'cultural contraband' from his youth toggle caption Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP For Bowen Yang, joining SNL as a writer in 2018, and then becoming a castmember the following year, was the fulfillment of a prophesy: during his senior year of high school, Yang had been voted "Most Likely to be on SNL." Looking back now, though, he insists that the superlative was "totally incidental." "It's like their way of calling me a hammy kid, basically, which I was," he says. I would bring VHS tapes to school … and just, like, show people when there was a substitute teacher in class." Sponsor Message SNL wasn't the only show that left its mark on Yang; he initially studied chemistry and pre-med in college after becoming "obsessed" with Sandra Oh's character on Grey's Anatomy, Yang says. I actually wanted to be someone who was on TV.'" Yang says he never thought SNL would hire "an effeminate Asian man" for that show, but he was happy to be proven wrong. "Sit[ting] next to [SNL creator and executive producer] Lorne [Michaels] each week and hav[ing] him give notes on your sketch at dress rehearsal, you really develop this internal sense of, 'OK, I understand how the show works in this very underpinned way.'" In addition to his work on SNL, Yang had a part in Wicked, and is co-host of the popular podcast Las Culturistas with his friend Matt Rogers. Sponsor Message Interview highlights On growing up as the child of Chinese immigrants, and being obsessed with pop culture As a closeted Canadian kid who then moved to the States ... it was this big shock to move from French Canada — to move from Quebec — to Colorado, where I was speaking primarily French at school and Mandarin in the house, and suddenly I had to fast-track to English. … I had this visceral response to not wanting to watch that version of myself, like the person who, before he went down the chute of working at SNL, had no idea what the show was looking for. Lorne had reached out and sort of had his plan for how he wanted to cast the main players in the general election, and I was pretty resistant at first, and after a few more conversations, I think I dutifully acquiesced, and then I kind of went about it in the most child-of-immigrants way, where I hired a dialect coach, and I requested a screen test where I tried out different contact lenses, because I felt like so much of JD Vance's sort of visual eeriness was in his eyes.

Article: special envoy to Lebanon said Monday that his team would discuss the long-term cessation of hostilities with Israel, after Beirut endorsed a U.S.-backed plan for the Hezbollah militant group to disarm. Tom Barrack, following a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, also said Washington would seek an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in the country, after months of shuttle diplomacy between the U.S. “Now what we need is for Israel to comply with that equal handshake.” Lebanon’s decision last week to support a plan to disarm Hezbollah angered the Iran-backed group and its allies, who believe Israel’s military should first withdraw from the five hilltops it has occupied in southern Lebanon since the end of its 14-month war with Hezbollah last November and stop launching almost daily airstrikes in the country.

Article: The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in 2021 is underway Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. (Mark Weber/Daily Memphian via AP, Pool) Defendant Hernandez Govan, accused of orchestrating the killing of rapper Young Dolph, appears in court during his trial in Memphis, Tenn., on Monday, August 18, 2025. Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world. During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti’s brother, Anthony “Big Jook” Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph’s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were “looking for somebody” and “didn’t know who we were going to catch.” They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph’s car. At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Jermarcus Johnson, who pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the killing, acknowledged helping his half-brother and Smith communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, “King of Memphis.” He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. In a 2024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a “very senseless murder” and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.

Article: Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa attend a press conference during their visit to the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, in Rafah, Egypt, August 18, 2025. Hamas has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal with Israel that includes the return of half the hostages held in Gaza and Israel's release of some Palestinian prisoners, an Egyptian official source said on Monday. Israel's plans to seize control of Gaza City in the heart of the Palestinian enclave have stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis on Sunday held some of the largest protests since the war began, urging a deal to end the fighting and free the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Thousands of Palestinians fearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory. In an apparent show of force on Monday, Israeli tanks advanced into the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, according to witnesses who counted the presence of at least nine tanks and bulldozers. Israel's Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Eyal Zamir, said his country was at a turning point in the Gaza war, "with its focus on enhancing the strikes against Hamas in Gaza City," the military spokesman said in a statement. In a video issued by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "I, like you, hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure." The Egyptian official source stated that the proposal accepted by Hamas included a suspension of Israeli military operations for 60 days and outlined a framework for a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-old conflict. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the Qatari prime minister, joined the discussions on Monday and met both Egyptian President el-Sisi and Hamas representatives, said an official briefed on the meetings. Israel approved the plan to take control of Gaza City earlier this month, but officials had said it could take weeks to start, leaving the door open for a ceasefire, even though Netanyahu had said it would get under way "fairly quickly" and end the war with Hamas' defeat.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Donald Trump expressed hope that their critical meeting Monday with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine. troops to the effort, saying instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence but that all those details would be hashed out in their afternoon meeting with EU leaders. “I think its very important to get the deal done.” WATCH: Zelenskyy brings Europe’s top leaders with him to meet Trump on ending Russia’s war Trump’s engagement with Zelenskyy had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelenskyy had shown insufficient gratitude for U.S. Here’s what to know “So let me just say three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections, oh, I wonder what the fake news would say,” Trump said. Monday’s hastily assembled meeting comes after Trump met on Friday with Putin and has said that the onus is now on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land that he said could end the war. The two will later gather with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Some things never change!!!” Zelenskyy responded with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.” Zelenskyy said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the U.S., Ukraine and Europe. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.” The European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the U.S. Ahead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. ‘A very big move’ European officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.

In late January, a cluster of cases was reported in western Texas near Gaines County -- near the border with New Mexico -- which had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state.

Texas health officials warned that the state is likely to experience additional cases this year given ongoing outbreaks in other parts of the U.S. The virus was declared eliminated by health officials in 2000 after a full year of no continuous spread, but declining vaccination rates have led to a growing number of outbreaks annually, experts say. "Vaccination rates in many communities remain far too low, leaving large pockets of children vulnerable to measles and other preventable diseases -- and that's why we're likely to continue seeing outbreaks," Brownstein said. The 2024-2025 school year had a record number of non-medical vaccine exemptions, with an estimated 286,000 kindergarteners attending school without documentation of receiving the shot that protects against measles, according to CDC data. "Measles isn't happening in isolation -- we're seeing a broader resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, from pertussis to polio threats, which underscores the urgent need to maintain high vaccination coverage and public trust in immunization," Brownstein added.

Article: DALLAS — Almost a dozen Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives refused to return to the state capitol on Monday with their colleagues despite the legislature now having enough members present for a quorum and to conduct business. The holdouts remain in suburban Chicago in a symbolic standoff against Governor Abbott who called the Texas legislature into a special legislative session to redraw congressional lines that will help President Trump keep control of Congress through the 2026 mid-term elections. I am focused on ensuring California passes its own maps which they must do by this coming Friday to ensure they nullify Trump and Abbott's power grab in Texas,” said state Rep. “But let me be clear: If Donald Trump and Greg Abbott bring their anti-Austin, anti-American redistricting scheme to the floor of the Texas House, I will return to represent my constituents and vote NO.” Despite the holdout, there were still enough Democrats who returned to the House chamber on Monday at 12 p.m. “We killed the corrupt special session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation, and rallied Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation — reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” said state Rep.

Prior to their return, some Texas officials had called for federal help to locate out-of-state Democrats and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had sought to declare some of the absent lawmakers' seats vacant, among other efforts. We'll move quickly and the schedule will be demanding until our work is complete." After the House gaveled in Monday, House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced a quorum was present and said civil arrest warrants remain in place for lawmakers who remain out of state. Because breaking quorum is not a crime, federal authorities don't have means to compel lawmakers to return to the Texas Capitol, but within state lines, the lawmakers could be placed under civil arrest and brought back to Capitol.

Article: 17 episode of “Velshi.” When The New Yorker’s David Kirkpatrick set out to determine just how much Donald Trump and his family have profited from his time as president, experts told him the exact figures were unknowable. So Kirkpatrick crunched the numbers himself, and the scale he reported is staggering: Since entering the White House in 2017, Kirkpatrick says the Trump family has reportedly reaped an astonishing $3.4 billion. There’s also the luxury jet given to the president by the emir of Qatar, which Trump has said will be donated to his presidential library after he leaves office, and at least five separate crypto ventures marketed with Trump’s name and political brand. When you add up the money from Mar-a-Lago, merch and money spent for legal fees by PACs, Trump has reportedly raked in about $253 million — and that’s before you count the foreign money. economy into something that looks like “state capitalism with American characteristics.” Like in China, it’s a system where the state — or in this case, Trump — rewards friends and punishes enemies. The president has steered billion-dollar deals, pushed out CEOs and, as the Journal points out, extracted $1.5 trillion in investment pledges from Japan, the European Union and South Korea, which he claims he will personally direct, though no legal mechanism for doing so appears to exist.

Article: Ex-Israel military intelligence chief said 50,000 Gaza deaths "necessary" TEL AVIV, Israel — Leaked audio recordings broadcast Friday reveal remarks by Israel's former chief of military intelligence about the price he believed Palestinians should pay for Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack. Aharon Haliva saying in Hebrew, "The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations." He went further, saying that for every Israeli killed on Oct. It is the first time a former senior Israeli military figure has been heard endorsing a high Palestinian death toll in Israel's nearly two-year-long offensive in Gaza, saying it was "necessary." The date the remarks were made was not broadcast. Israeli politicians have previously made incendiary calls about "erasing" Gaza and fighting "human animals" — rhetoric that has since been cited at the International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa as evidence Israel is pursuing genocide, which Israel denies. "The remarks by former head of Military Intelligence Aharon Haliva are part of a long line of official statements that expose a deliberate policy of genocide," said the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem in a post on X Haliva oversaw Israeli military intelligence divisions in the lead-up to the biggest intelligence failure in Israel's history — the Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel on Oct. He resigned from the military in April 2024, taking responsibility for the intelligence failures that allowed the Hamas assault and the kidnapping of more than 250 Israelis, 50 of whom still remain in captivity. Sponsor Message Israeli Channel 12 broadcasted a response by Haliva, in which he confirmed the authenticity of the remarks leaked from a private discussion, which he said he regretted, and said the quotes were taken out of context.

Article: In this article TGT HD WMT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT watch now As more tariffs take effect on goods imported into the U.S., a specific accounting method could have major implications for how American retailers calculate the impact. "This would normalize once tariffs stabilize, depending on how much of the cost retailers absorb." Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across a broad group of items, rather than the actual cost of every item, like in cost accounting, RIM does not entirely capture the immediate impact of rising costs. TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen estimated about half of Walmart's quarter will include the impact of levies, as the company brought in inventory at different cost levels before and after new tariff rates took effect. A week after Trump's April 2 announcement of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" on a wide swath of trade partners, Walmart withdrew its guidance for operating income in its first fiscal quarter. Jason Fochtman | Houston Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty Images Then when it reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Walmart said it would mitigate higher costs as much as possible, but would likely have to increase some prices at the current tariff rates. Walmart management briefed Trump this spring about the impact its accounting method may have on results in a high-tariff environment, according to a person familiar with the discussion, who asked to remain unnamed while speaking about private conversations. Still, James Bowie, managing director in EY's technical accounting advisory group, warned "all of the inventory costing methodologies will be affected in some ways." An employee folds towel at a Manhattan retail store on July 15, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images It typically takes a large, non-fast fashion retailer using RIM roughly two to four quarters for cost volatility to settle and profitability to get closer to its true level, according to PwC. It takes a little longer for it to turn and so even though they might ultimately be able to go the same speed, it takes a little bit of time for that one turn to take place." While RIM is more likely to lead to a temporary overstating of profitability, it can also wind up understanding profits if tariffs are negotiated lower. Bowie said if a retailer responds to lower tariff rates by cutting retail prices, under RIM accounting, "it looks like my margin has eroded, but it's only because I now am waiting for the cost relationship to catch back up, so [it] might look like there's margin compression even in a period of decreasing tariffs." Furman added that PwC is seeing "a clear disconnect" for companies that use RIM accounting. "[A retailer] had an abacus and a dream trying to figure out what you're going to do." Over time, technology made it easy to use actual costs rather than averages, so cost accounting became more common. CNBC US source For the purposes of this example, PwC and CNBC used weighted average cost accounting, which takes a SKU-level weight average and blends all costs together, regardless of purchase date. CNBC US source Tariff case 1: Retailer's costs increase, all else remains the same If the retailer's cost for each T-shirt goes up as a result of tariffs, but everything else — units bought, units sold and retail price — remains the same, gross margin falls if calculated using cost accounting and RIM. CNBC US source Tariff case 2: Retailer raises prices to offset higher costs If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of the tariff cost to the customer, and units bought and sold stay the same, gross margin improves under both accounting methods. Tariff case 3: Retailer raises prices and units bought and sold both fall Here's where it gets interesting, and likely more realistic, to reflect supply and demand choices a retailer and consumer would likely make as costs rise. If the retailer passes on the full dollar value of tariffs to the customer and also sells fewer items to consumers at the higher retail price, RIM makes profit margins look temporarily rosier.

Article: More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in its nearly two-year genocidal war on Gaza, with the population suffering relentless bombardment with nowhere safe in the besieged enclave, Israeli-induced starvation and the daily killing of people desperately seeking food for their families. Israel is intensifying strikes on Gaza City, the territory’s largest – and now destroyed – urban centre, as it plans to seize it and forcibly displace tens of thousands of people to concentration zones in the south. The scale of attacks illustrates how Israel’s current strategy is shaping the geography and demography of Gaza.” “We can see how Israel is using heavy artillery, fighter jets and drones, in order to destroy what’s left of residential homes there. People there say Israeli attacks are happening day and night.” Many who have already been displaced multiple times during the war by Israeli bombardment are on the move again from Gaza City. Advertisement But while many Palestinians who remain in the devastated city are forced to survive in the ruins of buildings, makeshift shelters, or tents, some people have told Al Jazeera that it would be impossible for them to leave. “We want them to [allow] us back to the homes we fled – we don’t need more than that.” Slight hope emerged as Hamas said it approved a Gaza ceasefire proposal put forward yesterday by mediators Qatar and Egypt. An informed source told Al Jazeera that the draft deal would ensure a 60-day truce that would see the release of half of the Israeli captives held in Gaza as well as an unspecified number of Palestinian captives imprisoned by Israel. But Palestinians in Gaza have seen countless false dawns before, and after a brief ceasefire in January was shattered by Israel in March, the war then entered its most grim phase of human misery. ‘Israel carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation’ Gaza’s Health Ministry says five more Palestinians have died from malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing monthslong blockade in the past 24 hours, including two children. The United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) warned that as of July 2025, more than 320,000 children – the entire population under the age of five in Gaza – are at risk of acute malnutrition. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says children in Gaza should be preparing for the new school year, but instead are searching for water, queuing for food, and living in classrooms turned into overcrowded shelters. In a report quoting displaced Palestinians and medical staff who have treated malnourished children, Amnesty said: “Israel is carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip.” Advertisement In the meantime, Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says its staff in Gaza are witnessing a surge in mass casualties linked to Israel’s ongoing siege and its oversight of limited distribution of aid by the controversial, US- and Israel-backed aid organisation GHF. “The indiscriminate killings, and the counts of mass casualties we still [see] on a daily basis right now, hasn’t stopped, but only increased in its scale,” said Nour Alsaqqa of MSF. “They go out of desperation and they risk their lives to access aid, which is still inaccessible due to Israel’s siege.” Since the establishment of the GHF aid sites at the end of May, nearly 2,000 people have been killed while trying to access aid, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Article: The Wall Street Journal, citing a European official and another person also involved in planning the summit, reported that the "White House has asked that Zelensky don a suit and tie to meet the president." But when Zelenskyy showed up at the White House, he appeared to have bucked that reported request. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA / Bloomberg via Getty Images file As Trump welcomed Zelenskyy to the Oval Office for that meeting in February, he panned his Ukrainian counterpart for his outfit by saying he was "all dressed up today.” At one point a reporter from the right-wing Real America’s Voice network asked Zelenskyy why he wasn't wearing a suit and said, “You’re at the highest level in this country’s office, and you refuse to wear a suit." Zelenskyy replied, “I will wear costume after this war will finish." (He also quipped: “Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don’t know.") The outfit Zelenskyy wore Monday seems to be his attempt to thread the needle between maintaining his independence while showing a bit of receptivity to pressure from the White House — and trying to get the best possible peace deal for Ukraine. But if the White House considered its demand that Zelenskyy conform to its sartorial wishes a test, Zelenskyy appears to have shown he was only willing to go part of the way.

Article: Nearly a year ago, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced off in their first and only presidential debate, and when the discussion turned to Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Democratic vice president told her Republican rival what he didn’t want to hear. As NBC News summarized: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from a nearly three-hour meeting on the Ukraine war and struck a cordial tone in brief public statements, but left without announcing a ceasefire or peace agreement. John McCain, a month before his death, went so far as to call Trump’s appearance in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” But the second summit was, by most measures, even worse — because as the American president acknowledged, the stakes were vastly higher. Chris Murphy of Connecticut explained, simply, “Putin got everything he wanted.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point: Trump handed Putin a victory before the summit even began by extending an invitation and giving the Russian leader the legitimacy he’s craved. Trump handed Putin a public relations victory in Alaska, literally rolling out the red carpet for the dictator, literally applauding him, welcoming him into the presidential limo, and treating Putin with deference, even letting the Russian leader speak first (and longer) at their pseudo press conference. Trump handed Putin a strategic victory by abandoning the White House’s own policy: The American president said he’s no longer seeking a ceasefire as a precursor to broader negotiations — the policy Trump spent months trying to secure — which necessarily strengthens Moscow’s hand. “For all the promises of a cease-fire, of severe economic consequences, of being disappointed, it took two minutes on the red carpet and 10 minutes in the Beast for Putin to play Trump again. When Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked the American president to rate the talks on a scale of 1 to 10, Trump replied, “I think the meeting was a 10, in the sense we got along great.” And if the point of the talks were for Trump and Putin to “get along great,” then it was certainly a triumph, but in Grown-Up Land, there were other objectives on the to-do list. “We’re not walking out of there with a deal,” a White House official told Politico ahead of the summit — hours before they walked out of there without a deal. As this week gets underway, Zelenskyy will meet with the American president in the White House, and he’s bringing some backup: The Ukrainian leader will be joined by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, U.K.

Article: Under normal circumstances, no one would think to ask the Pentagon whether the current secretary of defense supports women’s voting rights, but there’s little about our current political landscape that’s “normal.” Hence, The Hill reported: The Trump administration on Thursday sought to clarify Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s support for women’s voting rights following controversy spurred by his repost of a video tied to a pastor who said the opposite. I can appreciate why the DOD’s right-wing spokesperson — someone who, as Politico reported earlier this year, “has touted antisemitic views, white supremacist conspiracy theories and Kremlin-like statements on social media” — would be eager to dismiss the line of inquiry. In fact, it was just two weeks ago when Hegseth used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, but he also didn’t make any effort to distance himself from the rhetoric used in the video he shared with his online followers. On the contrary, he promoted the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” When this sparked a controversy, the former Fox News host could’ve made it clear that he disagreed with the comments, or that he supports leaving the 19th Amendment intact. When asked about the video he promoted, a Pentagon spokesperson told the AP that Hegseth is “a proud member of a church” that is affiliated with CREC and he “very much appreciates many of Mr.

That day, he called a medical team at the National Institutes of Health that had created an experimental cell therapy, custom-made to attack his cancer as part of a clinical trial. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A week later, Schlueter and his wife, Michelle, saw NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya push back on concerns raised by his own staff that the ouster of essential employees and other disruptions to the biomedical research agency were harming science and patients. But on June 3, his NIH doctor informed him that it would now take eight to 10 weeks because of cuts to essential lab personnel — a painful illustration of the life-or-death stakes of the administration’s approach to shrinking the government workforce. You can imagine the difficulty as we have to tell them these things.” An official with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, said the agency had ways of addressing the delays.

The latest terms are similar to those that Israel had previously accepted and they include both a temporary cease-fire and a path to an agreement to end the war, according to the two diplomats and the Egyptian official.

Article: “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife," a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and "delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: 'Ketamine Queen' accused of selling fatal dose to Matthew Perry agrees to plead guilty LOS ANGELES -- A woman known as the "Ketamine Queen," charged with selling Matthew Perry the drug that killed him, agreed to plead guilty Monday. Jasveen Sangha Sangha agreed to plead guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine, and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury. Prosecutors had cast Sangha as a prolific drug dealer who was known to her customers as the "Ketamine Queen," using the term often in press releases and court documents and even including it in the official name of the case. A federal indictment charged Sangha with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, one count of possession with intent to distribute ketamine and five counts of distribution of ketamine. If it were not great stuff she'd lose her business." With the two men acting as middlemen, Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash four days before his death. Her home in North Hollywood, California, was raided in March 2024 by Drug Enforcement Administration agents who found large amounts of methamphetamines and ketamine, according to an affidavit from an agent.

Article: Key takeaways so far from Ukraine talks in Washington 11 minutes ago Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from the White House Laura Gozzi BBC News Share Save Watch: Key moments from Zelensky-Trump White House talks Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to the White House on Monday to meet US President Donald Trump for fresh talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Follow live updates on this story Zelensky launches charm offensive Given his acrimonious last visit to the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president went to considerable lengths to be collegial and charm his American hosts - including a flurry of six "thank yous" within the first few minutes of the meeting. The last time he was at the White House, Zelensky was scolded by Vice-President JD Vance for a perceived lack of gratitude for US support for Ukraine during the war. This time, Zelensky was dressed in a dark suit rather than his traditional military garb, and appeared well prepared with a joke when asked about his outfit by the same reporter who had previously criticised him for not wearing a suit to the Oval Office. After the reporter told him that he looked "fabulous", Zelensky shot back that he was wearing the "same suit" as last time, eliciting laughter from the reporters, Trump and other officials in the room. Reuters The pair presented a warmer front on Monday - with comedian-turned-politician Zelensky joking about their first, acrimonious meeting Zelensky also sought to play to Trump's family during the meeting, handing the US president a letter from Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to Melania Trump. The delivery of the letter comes just days after Trump hand-delivered a letter from Melania to Vladimir Putin while in Alaska, in which she called on Putin to protect "the innocence" of children and "nurture the next generation's hope". And she says it very openly, very proudly, and with great sorrow, because so many people have been killed." Trump hints at security guarantees One of the questions put to Zelensky was about what he would need from the US to guarantee his country's security. In a moment that conveyed the sense of urgency he seemingly tried to suppress throughout much of the press conference, Zelensky leaned forward in his chair and said, emphatically: "Everything." "We need a strong Ukrainian army," he added. But the lack of detail on what exactly these guarantees might consist of is concerning to both Kyiv and Europe, and behind closed doors leaders will no doubt try to impress on Trump that the US deterrent needs to be more than just symbolic.

Stocks are idling to start a new week, holding just below record highs as Wall Street awaits some potentially consequential updates on the consumer and Federal Reserve policy. The S & P 500 was nearly flat, sitting in its narrowest daily range of the year, holding tight to its closing level both from Friday and last Tuesday, the day that a mostly benign Consumer Price Index report for July solidified expectations for a Fed rate cut next month. A modest majority of stocks were up on the day Monday, the equal-weighted S & P 500 barely was in the green, with the longtime laggard Russell 2000 small-cap gauge lifting by about 0.3%. Meta Platforms was by far the biggest drag on the S & P 500, down 2.2%, apparently on a report in The Information detailing another restructuring of its AI efforts, perhaps exacerbated by OpenAI founder Sam Altman granting that some AI investing activity is looking a bit bubbly. Ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium late this week, the Street is getting itself wound pretty tight over how Chair Jay Powell might characterize the chances of a September cut. On the one hand, circumstances are plausibly converging around one idea: In June, FOMC officials anticipated two more rate cuts by year end and there are only three more meetings. On the other hand, Powell probably has little incentive to commit firmly given high lame-duck status and the fact that more employment and inflation numbers will hit before the September meeting.

Article: A woman has sued a Florida dairy farm linked by state officials to an outbreak of infections from consuming raw milk, claiming she lost her unborn child while caring for her toddler who got sick from the milk. Rachel Maddox claimed she didn’t know about the risks involved with raw milk and her child became seriously sick after consuming the product, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Seminole County. Now she’s suing Keely Farms Dairy, a farm in New Smyrna Beach, which the Florida Department of Health earlier this month said was linked to at least 21 cases of campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing E. At the time, the Florida Department of Health said it was working with the farm to ensure “effective sanitation practices are implemented consistently across every batch.” In the suit, Maddox claimed she purchased Keely Farms Dairy raw milk at Wild Hare Natural Market in June of this year when she was nearly 20 weeks pregnant. Maddox and her husband began to provide the milk to their toddler, identified by the initials L.U., but after consuming the raw milk on June 8, 2025, the lawsuit alleges L.U. They took the toddler to Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children on June 9 “for the first of what would be three emergency room visits and hospitalizations in the next several weeks,” the suit said. STEC bacteria in the most severe form can also result in hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure and is particularly concerning for children, the Florida Health Department said.

He suggested that women who had publicly disagreed with Rowling in recent years were "astonishingly complicit in their own erasure", and compared them to a commander's wife in the patriarchal regime in The Handmaid's Tale who is "ready to pin a handmaiden down as her husband rapes her".

Article: A transgender distance runner is suing the NCAA and her former college, alleging they violated state and federal law by barring her from the women’s track and field team because of her gender identity. Evie Parts, who graduated from Swarthmore College in May, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday accusing the NCAA and the school of violating Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex discrimination in education. For two months this year, the complaint says, Swarthmore told Parts she had to compete as part of the men’s team or run unattached to the school, meaning she could not access its services for athletes, including transportation and medical care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The ultimatum pushed Parts into a severe “depressive state” and she “in one moment told a friend that she wanted to kill herself,” the lawsuit states. Advertisement Parts’s removal from the team came after the NCAA changed its transgender athlete policy, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth — a measure most Americans generally support. The NCAA revised the policy to comport with President Donald Trump’s executive order stating that schools would be denied Title IX funding if they allowed transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. She argues that by following rules from the NCAA — a private, nongovernmental organization — and excluding her from competing with the women’s track team, Swarthmore disregarded Title IX and Pennsylvania law, which bars discrimination based on gender identity. Her lawsuit calls the NCAA’s revision a “bigoted policy that subjected transgender women to segregation and ridicule.” In a statement Monday, Swarthmore said it worked with Parts during “a time of rapidly evolving guidance, while balancing the ability for other members of the women’s track team to compete in NCAA events.” Advertisement “We recognize that this is an especially difficult and painful time for members of the transgender community, including student-athletes,” Swarthmore said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Under Trump, schools across the country have been forced to navigate Education Department probes and new policies targeting transgender students, the facilities they use and the sports they play. Over the next few weeks, Parts competed in at least one race as an unattached athlete, paying the entry fee, driving herself there and buying her own jersey to wear because she could not wear the Swarthmore uniform, according to the complaint. During the race, the filing states, Parts wore arm sleeves with the jersey to “hide the razor marks on her arms because she did not want her teammates nor her parents to see the incisions that she inflicted on herself.” Ahead of another race in April, Parts hired an attorney to help ensure that she could run unattached, the lawsuit says.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we have the latest on President Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Republicans’ redistricting plans in Texas now that a group of Democratic lawmakers have returned home. — Adam Wollner Trump and Zelenskyy signal progress as they meet with European leaders on Ukraine war By Peter Nicholas, Megan Lebowitz and Kristen Welker President Donald Trump met for about an hour at the White House today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an accelerating effort to end the grinding war with Russia on terms acceptable to both sides. Trump greeted the Ukrainian leader in the early afternoon with a smile and warm handshake — a stark difference from the tense televised meeting the two men held in February in the Oval Office. Fresh off a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump summoned Zelenskyy to see if they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine’s future security and the status of territory that the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine. A number of European leaders joined Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House to work toward a breakthrough in the nearly three-and-a-half-year conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if allowed to persist. (At Zelenskyy’s last meeting at the White House, a reporter asked him why he wasn’t wearing a suit.) When his meeting with Trump ended, Zelenskyy said: “We had a very good conversation — maybe the best one.” What happens next is far from clear. Depending on the progress made, he said he would try to convene a meeting that hasn’t happened since the war began — a trilateral summit with himself, Putin and Zelenskyy.

Our return allows us to build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses.” Texas Democrats, without any real legislative power, won praise nationwide from members of their party for delaying the Republicans’ pursuit of a rare, mid-decade redistricting effort and raising awareness of the issue. They said their second condition to return was for California Democrats to release a plan that would seek to offset any changes Texas Republicans made to their map, which they did on Friday. takeover: Some Republicans governors announced over the weekend that they are sending their states’ National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to supplement Trump’s effort to combat crime in the nation’s capital.

Netanyahu said in a video addressing the Israeli public that reports of Hamas’ acceptance of the proposal showed that it is “under massive pressure.” Palestinian death toll surpasses 62,000 Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200, mostly civilians, in the attack that ignited the war. More deaths linked to malnutrition Experts have warned that Israel's ongoing offensive is pushing Gaza toward famine, even after it eased a complete 2 1/2-month blockade on the territory in May. It says at least 112 children have died of malnutrition-related causes since the war began, and 151 adults have died since the ministry started tracking adult malnutrition deaths in June. partner organizations reported that community kitchens in north and south Gaza produced 380,000 daily meals daily last week — far fewer than the more than 1 million daily meals they produced in April.

Article: in bioinformatics, and I could be making a lot more money in Silicon Valley, which is only a few hours away, but I made career choices to position myself in Yosemite National Park, because this is the place that I love the most.” SJ Joslin was a park ranger and wildlife biologist for Yosemite who studied bats. Courtesy SJ Joslin When asked for comment on Joslin’s termination, a spokesperson for Yosemite National Park said the National Park Service, which oversees Yosemite, “is pursuing administrative action against multiple National Park Service employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” The spokesperson did not immediately respond to an additional question about which regulations the employees allegedly violated. Joslin, who is 35 and had been going to the park for years prior to working there, has written Yosemite climbing guidebooks and volunteered to work overtime to help issue hiking permits and manage traffic in the park. Joslin said they came up with the idea to hang the trans pride flag on El Capitan in the spring after President Donald Trump issued a variety of executive orders targeting trans people, including orders to change the federal definition of sex to exclude trans identities, restrict access to trans health care and prohibit trans women from competing in female sports. Jayce Kolinski Joslin said the flag display, which they organized with other LGBTQ climbers and advocates and participated in outside of work hours, was intended to celebrate trans people and show that everyone is welcome in the nation’s parks. The flag was up on El Capitan for about two hours when park officials told the climbers to remove it, though the climbers said at the time that they were not told that they had broken any park rules. Courtesy SJ Joslin There was no policy prohibiting the display of flags on El Capitan until the day after Joslin and their team hung the trans flag, when the National Park Service issued a new rule banning the hanging of large flags in wilderness areas. “Hanging flags has been a tradition that climbers have done on El Cap for decades, and that’s both individuals who are visiting the park, but also employees that are on their off time,” Joslin said. I’m the only one who’s been fired for it.” Joslin said two other NPS employees, including one who works in Yosemite and another who works in a different park, are under investigation for helping to display the trans flag. They plan to seek legal counsel to try to contest the decision, citing an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his presidency to protect free speech and end federal censorship. “I think that everyone as Americans should be upset about this, and it doesn’t matter who I am or what my identity is, this is a matter of free speech.”

Link: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ticketmaster-reseller-sued-over-illegal-ticket-buying-scheme-rcna225726
Article: A ticket-reselling operation used a network of fake accounts to bypass Ticketmaster’s security protocols to grab hundreds of thousands of tickets to hugely popular tours for artists like Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen and then re-sold them for millions, federal regulators said Monday. In total, the group is accused of buying 321,286 tickets to 3,261 live performances from June 2022 to December 2023, in bunches of 15 or more tickets to each event at a total cost of approximately $46.7 million and then reselling them for $52.4 million, netting approximately $5.7 million. That includes $1.2 million from reselling tickets in 2023 for Taylor Swift’s record-breaking “The Eras Tour.” In one instance, the suspects used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets for Swift’s March 2023 tour stop in Las Vegas, vastly exceeding Ticketmaster’s six-ticket limit, which they then sold for $120,000, the FTC alleges. The FTC says the defendants at one point printed up flyers in places like Baltimore claiming that participants could “make money doing verified van sign ups” in just “3 easy steps,” earning $5 for the account creation and $5 to $20 each time they received a Verified Fan presale code. It was subsequently forced to postpone the sale date for the general public seeking tickets to Swift’s tour “due to demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory.” In response, Swift alluded to broken “trust” with Ticketmaster, though she didn’t name it directly. “It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties, and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse,” she wrote in an Instagram message in 2022, adding: “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them multiple times if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.” Springsteen said in a statement at the time that “ticket buying has gotten very confusing, not just for the fans, but for the artists also” but that most of his tickets are “totally affordable.” In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order focused on curbing exploitative ticket reselling practices that raise costs for fans. Ferguson said Trump's order made clear "that unscrupulous middlemen who harm fans and jack up prices through anticompetitive methods will hear from us.” “Today’s action puts brokers on notice that the Trump-Vance FTC will police operations that unlawfully circumvent ticket sellers’ purchase limits, ensuring that consumers have an opportunity to buy tickets at fair prices,” he said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether that suit is still active, but in July, Ticketmaster and Live Nation sued the FTC to block the investigation, saying that ticket purchases on its site did not use automated software, or bots, and did not violate the 2016 Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act. Strangely, in the latest complaint, the FTC includes a slide from an internal Ticketmaster presentation from 2018 that suggests the company was weighing the economic impact of imposing stricter purchasing caps that would curb bots but potentially hurt its finances. On a page labeled “evaluating potential actions” a data table is shown under the heading “serious negative economic impact if we move to 8 ticket limit across the board.” It also includes an email from one of the defendants in which he “owns up” to having exceeded the ticket-purchase limit for a May 2024 Bad Bunny show in Miami and offers to have the orders canceled, to which a Ticketmaster rep simply responds that “as long as the purchases were made using different accounts and cards, it’s within the guidelines.” Efforts to reach the three defendants — Taylor Kurth, Elan Rozmaryn and Yair Rozmaryn — named in the suit announced Monday were unsuccessful.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article Gilbert Dryden probably only has enough medication to get him through the end of October, his mother, Madison, figures. “This drug totally saves the lives of babies.” After a more than decade-long process to bring the drug to market, the treatment’s approval has repeatedly hit roadblocks with the Food and Drug Administration. “It’s the highest level of desperation.” On Monday, Stealth announced that it did submit its third application for approval of elamipretide — asking for an accelerated pathway under a significantly tighter timeline than what the agency initially recommended. In October 2024, an advisory committee to the FDA voted 10-6 in support of the therapy, paving the way for the agency to clear the first drug to treat Barth syndrome. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, wrote in an email that the “FDA did carefully consider the advice of the advisory committee members, including their rationale for their vote. While there is often a high rate of agreement between FDA and advisory committee recommendations,” the spokesman said, “there is not always concordance.” ‘Compelling medical need’ for approval After the advisory committee’s recommendation, the FDA’s rejection was unexpected. But the former official was quick to point out that given the advisory committee recommendation for approval, the “incredibly compelling medical need” of those living with Barth syndrome and the small sample of individuals who seemed to have benefited from the treatment, it certainly appeared that elamipretide was going to make it across the finish line. “And I think that’s led to an adverse outcome for some of these rare disease products.” The HHS spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request Monday for comment about the agency’s rejection of the drug or leadership issues. A Wall Street Journal Op-Ed recently offered a scathing evaluation of what’s happening at the FDA, questioning whether the agency and Commissioner Marty Makary’s stated goal of accelerating lifesaving drugs is matching the reality of their actions. The Journal said that there were averages of 52 annual drug approvals under the first Trump administration and 48 under President Joe Biden, but “there have been only 22 in the first seven months of this year,” projecting to just 38 for the year. “We’re going to have to watch them really closely because they’re at risk for recurrence of heart failure and rehospitalization and potentially decompensation to the point where they have to live in the hospital until they could get a heart transplant.” A transplant addresses the heart problem but doesn’t alleviate ongoing muscular and skeletal problems. “In fact, for Barth Syndrome, this elamipretide is really the only drug that we know of that works.” Carter said that there are six families in Georgia alone he’s been in contact with who have a loved one with the rare disease. After the recent FDA decision, Carter told NBC News in a statement that he’s “disappointed” with the recommendation “now that all issues appear to be resolved.” Carter said he’s continuing to put pressure on the FDA and that “patients will suffer with further delays.” He also acknowledged that the economics of a private company, like Stealth, attempting to continue developing a drug for such a small population of patients would be exceedingly difficult without FDA backing. Madison Dryden and her husband are left with what they call a “giant unknown” in the absence of approval, struggling for an explanation for their 7- and 3-year-old daughters as families are in a race against time to keep loved ones alive. “They know that somebody is not giving permission for Gilbert to have his medicine, and that they keep saying no, and they’re our kids — like they can’t lose … we can’t have them lose their baby brother to this,” she said.

That place is not having roving bands of officers in tactical gear, aimlessly walking around.” Fanone said Trump is using federal agents to create “the optics of an occupying force” and spread “fear.” “Citizens don’t want to feel as though they’re occupied. Fanone didn’t direct his ire just at Trump, he also accused federal law enforcement agents — particularly ICE — of being complicit in the president’s overreach, calling the agency “Donald Trump’s Police Department.” Fanone said he had a simple message for “everyone in the law enforcement community that’s being co-opted by the Trump administration to do things that are immoral, unethical and, in many cases, unconstitutional: Quit your job.” “There’s a lot of other jobs out there,” Fanone said. “I quit my job at the police department, and I got to tell you, when it comes to law enforcement, the grass is always greener somewhere else.” You can watch Fanone’s full reaction in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: READ MORE: ‘Brain rot’ is Oxford’s word of the year “Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical program manager at Cambridge Dictionary, the world’s largest online dictionary. “Skibidi” is a gibberish term coined by the creator of an animated YouTube series and can mean “cool” or “bad” or be used with no real meaning as a joke. Other planned additions include “tradwife,” a contraction of “traditional wife” referring to a married mother who cooks, cleans and posts on social media, and “delulu,” a shortening of the word delusional that means “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to.” Christian Ilbury, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, said many of the new words are tied to social media platforms like TikTok because that is how most young people communicate. Cambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than 2 billion words of written and spoken English, to monitor how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used, the company said. “If you look at what a dictionary’s function is, it’s a public record of how people use language and so if people are now using words like ‘skibidi’ or ‘delulu,’ then the dictionary should take account of that,” Ilbury said.

Article: In two lawsuits filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the Tate brothers accuse TikTok and Meta of defaming and unlawfully “deplatforming” them by removing their social media accounts. The lawsuits, which are largely identical, claim the removals of their accounts were “not an isolated enforcement action grounded in neutral application of its Terms of Use, rather, it was the culmination of a coordinated campaign to suppress, silence, and destroy the reputations and livelihoods of two controversial but law-abiding men.” The brothers also allege that the “deplatforming” was done without notice or explanation and that it violated contractual agreements and stripped them of their main sources of revenue. Their brand and business model relied heavily on their social media engagement, the lawsuits say, and their removals from the platforms led to “substantial and irreplaceable financial loss and damage.” TikTok and Meta “inflicted” “substantial financial, reputational, and emotional harm,” according to the lawsuit. In May, the U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service charged both brothers with rape, human trafficking and other crimes, leading Romanian courts to issue an order to extradite them to the U.K. In 2023, they filed a defamation suit in Palm Beach County, Florida, Circuit Court against people they claim provided false evidence to Romanian authorities and conspired to deceive officials to have them wrongfully imprisoned. The Tates’ lawsuits note that while they were “arrested in Romania and placed under house arrest in connection with criminal investigations, neither was, or has been, convicted of human trafficking or sexual exploitation.” “Despite this, TikTok and other actors repeatedly invoked these allegations to justify censorship and reputational damage, again with no opportunity for Plaintiffs to question or dispel such false and malicious accusations,” the lawsuits say. Andrew Tate has previously pushed back against the criticisms of his online presence, telling NBC News in November 2022 that he is playing an “online character.” He said at the time that he makes “many videos praising women” and that his coaching involves teaching men “to avoid toxic people as a whole.” Tate said he tells his audience to avoid “low value people,” including “toxic men.” Andrew Tate wrote Sunday on X that he is shelling out money (he says “400,000,000 of personal funds”) to battle the platforms and those who tried to “cancel” him, including “mainstream media across Australia UK and USA,” as well as “every single girl who lied about me.” “It’s good vs evil and I will lose my entire fortune in this fight,” he wrote to his nearly 11 million followers. “I’m happy to go broke and live on the street trying to beat The Matrix.” The brothers seek more than $50 million in compensatory damages from each company, according to the respective lawsuits.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/national-guard-dc-trump-republican-governors-ohio-rcna225606
Article: In one sense, the decisions of the governors of Ohio, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia to send National Guard troops from their states to aid President Donald Trump’s authoritarian takeover of Washington, D.C., should not have surprised anyone. Patrick Morrisey proclaimed such allegiance when he signed three pieces of legislation that his office said were “meant to protect the 2nd Amendment rights of West Virginians.” Morrisey said at the time: “As Governor, I will always support and defend West Virginians’ God-given constitutional rights. The bills I signed today further enshrine West Virginia’s strong support for the Second Amendment.” This is not the first time that President Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. But let’s compare the decisions of Morrissey, South Carolina’s Henry McMaster, Mississippi's Tate Reeves and Ohio’s Mike DeWine to deploy their states’ National Guard with the language of the Second Amendment. It reads, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Note why the militia is needed: for the “security of a free State” [emphasis added]. The governors were eager to make clear that they, as McMaster explained, stand "with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital.” Or take Morrisey, who said, “West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital.” This is not the first time that Trump has tested the loyalty of red-state governors in this way. While red states jumped to answer the president’s call, governors and Guard commanders in blue states were incredulous.” “The result,” the Post continues, “was a deployment to the nation’s capital that military historians say appears to have been without precedent: Over 98 percent of the 3,800 troops that arrived in the District came from states with Republican governors.” Five years later, the deployment of troops from Trump-loving states in the District of Columbia, where every one of Trump’s Democratic opponents has received over 90% of the vote and where Blacks make up almost 45% of the population, is no less disturbing. The drafters of the Declaration of Independence included among the British monarchy’s “repeated injuries and usurpations” the following: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures; He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power;” and kept “large bodies of armed troops among us.” That’s why people like Alexander Hamilton thought it was important that states have their own military force. “If standing armies,” he wrote, “are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions.” Hamilton hoped that militias controlled by the states would be all that would be necessary to assure peace in the new Republic and did not think that they ever would threaten liberty. Whatever their views on whether the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms, historians generally agree that one of the key purposes of the amendment was to ensure that states had the resources needed to resist encroachments on liberty perpetrated by the federal government. As Supreme Court Justice James McReynolds put it in 1939, “In a militia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates over that of the soldier.” Troops from Ohio, South Carolina, Mississippi and West Virginia deployed in Washington are being asked to display the character of soldiers, not that of the “neighbors” that Hamilton envisioned. Hamilton thought that there would be no danger “from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits, and interests.” Sending members of state National Guards to a place different in “feelings, sentiments, habits and interests” from the District of Columbia may please the president.

Article: Trump wants to stop states from voting by mail and using voting machines toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images President Trump announced Monday on his social media site, Truth Social, that he plans to "lead a movement" to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines in the country ahead of next year's midterm elections. "We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail in ballots because they're corrupt," Trump said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Monday. It's the only way they can get elected." Sponsor Message Although Trump himself urged his supporters to vote using mail-in ballots prior to the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have been significantly more likely to vote using mail-in ballots, compared to Republicans, since the 2020 election . "Unless the president has some theory under which he could try to ban certain kinds of voting machines or tried to ban mail in ballots by enforcing some existing federal law, he would need the cooperation of Congress," Hasen said, "which I think he'd be unlikely to get to have any kind of federal interference with how the midterm elections will be run." Sponsor Message David Becker, the executive director and founder of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the Founders deliberately gave the president no role in how elections are conducted. "Hamilton foresaw, and made clear in Federalist 59 that a democracy must diversify power of elections in order to protect itself from an overzealous executive, and therefore power over elections would reside with the several states," he told NPR in a statement. It would also be a logistical stretch to upend how states run their elections as midterm primaries get closer, said Matt Germer, director of the right-of-center R Street Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "And they need to make sure that they invest the resources in an in-person voting to maybe account for that." He said officials would have to find more locations to host polling places. "It would be a huge undertaking and I think realistically it's highly unlikely that he could end voting by mail or end the use of very particular voting machines in time for 2026 now," Germer said. Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, which advocates for wide use of mail-in voting, said it would be nearly impossible to actually get rid of mail-in voting in such a short timeframe. "This is yet another power grab of federal overreach into the states' rights to run their own election." Hasen said Trump has tried to interfere in elections before by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, so he said "it would not be surprising" if he were again trying to interfere with a major election. "And so now is the time to take preparations on the part of states and parts of courts and others to ensure that the elections that we conduct in 2026 will be conducted with fairness and integrity," Hasen said.

Article: The California state legislature passed a bill Monday that ensures homeowners, not lenders, receive at least some of the interest on insurance payouts for homes destroyed or damaged by natural disasters. California Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders. "If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks," Harabedian told CNBC. "This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild," Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced. "It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period," Harabedian said.

Article: The scenes are part of a 2-minute video Kastyukevich posted on the Telegram messaging app showing Russian officials and their local allies removing young children from the Regional Children’s Home in Kherson in late October, weeks before it was liberated by Ukrainian forces. The country accuses Moscow of abducting tens of thousands of its children and shipping them to Russia with the intent of stripping them of their national identity, a crime that Ukrainian officials call a form of genocide. Russia denies allegations of war crimes, and says it has evacuated close to 2 million civilians, including hundreds of thousands of children, from what it said were dangerous areas of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials in Kherson immediately called it a “kidnapping.” Very little is known about what happened to the children, but senior Russian officials told NBC News that they are still in Crimea. On Friday, Ukraine formally charged Kastyukevich, who shared the video of the children’s evacuation, as well as an ex-worker at the orphanage and an official in the region, accusing them of the illegal transfer and deportation of the children from the facility. In an unprecedented move against the leader of a permanent United Nations Security Council member state, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and his children’s representative, Maria Lvova-Belova, in March. Prosecutors at the Hague-based war-crimes court accused them of “unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children” from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia, including “the deportation of at least hundreds of children taken from orphanages and children’s care homes.” Moscow has dismissed accusations that it illegally deports Ukrainian children, and Russian officials have touted cases where they say they rescued children from active fighting. Lvova-Belova, who has said in multiple Telegram posts that she is now the foster parent of a child from Mariupol , a city devastated by Russia’s war, has borne the brunt of international scrutiny. (Bernat Armangue / AP file) Her social media feeds are full of videos of Russian foster families greeting Ukrainian orphans, whom she has personally delivered across the country, with balloons and toys. Lvova-Belova says she visited the children from the Kherson Regional Children’s Home in a home in Crimea shortly after they were removed from Ukraine, and promised to find their relatives. (Kremlin.ru) She did not respond to a request to visit the children in Crimea, but did tell NBC News that her office was actively looking for their relatives in Ukraine. Mykola Kuleba, CEO of Save Ukraine , a leading nongovernmental organization that helps deported Ukrainian children return home, said the organization had identified the children taken from the Kherson orphanage and is looking into the case. After the ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova — in part to prevent “further commission of crimes” — Kuleba said reuniting children with families had become even more challenging. Lyudmyla Afanasieva is a former staff member of the Kherson orphanage and cared for the children while they were in the basement of a church whose pastor had sheltered them during heavy fighting. (Chris McGrath / Getty Images file) At least three senior Ukrainian officials told NBC News they were actively working on the case: the country’s chief prosecutor, its children’s representative and the human rights ombudsman. “If we are speaking about little ones who, in a year, can forget about where they are from, what their names are … it will be very difficult to return these children, but we will fight for every one of them,” Herasymchuk said. In May, nearly 15 months after Russia’s invasion, Lvova-Belova said that Kyiv had for the first time sent concrete information on 11 children whose parents were looking for them, without providing their locations or further details. “Thousands of names” had been forwarded to his counterpart in Moscow, Tatyana Moskalkova, who works closely with Lvova-Belova, he said, although he did not provide any documents or other evidence.

The women's wing of a mental health centre run by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is the largest of only a handful of facilities in the country dedicated to helping women with mental illnesses. Thought to be in her mid-20s, she's been here for nine years, after enduring what she describes as abuse and neglect by her family, followed by a period of homelessness. Mariam has been in this facility for nine years Their stories are far from unique at the centre, where our visit, including conversations with staff and patients, is overseen by officials from the Taliban government. No-one comes to visit, and they end up living and dying here." Years of conflict has left its mark on the mental health of many Afghans, especially women, and the issue is often poorly understood and subject to stigma. In response to a recent UN report on the worsening situation of women's rights in Afghanistan, Hamdullah Fitrat, Taliban government's deputy spokesperson, told the BBC that their government did not allow any violence against women and they have "ensured women's rights in Afghanistan". But UN data released in 2024 points to a worsening mental health crisis linked to the Taliban's crackdown on women's rights: 68% of women surveyed reported having "bad" or "very bad" mental health. Many have no male relative to provide for them - 80% of my patients are young women with family issues." The Taliban government says it is committed to providing health services.

Article: At the meeting among President Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other European leaders on Monday in Washington, there was frequent discussion of “security guarantees” to make sure Russia does not invade again. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has talked about assembling a force, drawn from a “coalition of the willing,” that would be stationed in Ukraine after a cease-fire or peace agreement. It would be put in place only for defensive purposes, but the idea would be to deter Russia by making the Kremlin think hard about getting into a conflict with soldiers from NATO member states. It would not be able to mount much of a defense, but the theory is that the Russians would hesitate to risk killing non-Ukrainian Europeans in any resumed invasion effort.

Article: It appears to have been rekindled, or at least stoked, by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reinforced Trump's unsubstantiated view that postal ballots "rigged" the 2020 election, at a summit Friday in Alaska. Follow live politics updates here In an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Friday, Trump relayed that "one of the most interesting things" Putin told him during the summit had to do with the unreliability of mail-in voting. "They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do." He also brought it up when he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later in the day, saying, "Mail-in ballots are corrupt." But Trump faces high legal and political hurdles to changing the laws governing federal elections: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, the popularity of absentee balloting and the GOP's success in using mail-in votes in key swing states, such as Trump's home state, Florida. The Constitution vests the power for choosing the "times, places and manner" of House and Senate elections in state legislatures, with Congress and the president retaining the right to pass laws overriding them. "I don’t want to presuppose what might be in the executive order, but I think it’s pretty clear that the times, places and manners of elections are set by the state. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement, “Senate Democrats will make sure that any and every measure that would make it even more difficult for Americans to vote will be dead on arrival in the Senate and will continue to fight to protect our democracy." The Republican National Committee hinted at the power of Congress in a statement Monday supporting Trump's plan. “Under his leadership and direction, the RNC is continuing to build upon our historic election integrity efforts from the successful 2024 election cycle, and we will be ready to help implement any and all changes made to our nation’s election laws by the President and Congress," RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said. "The Republican Election Integrity motto is simple: we want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” Beyond those challenges, many Republicans say Trump is fishing in a politically toxic pond that is better left alone. By contrast, in 2024, his advisers persuaded him to embrace those practices on the premise that he could "bank" votes early and not have to spend money trying to mobilize people who had already cast ballots. What is he talking about?’” Trump's White House recently hosted a group of secretaries of state to discuss "our ongoing commitment to election integrity," said Ben Kindel, a spokesperson for Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican. … Changes to Ohio's voting process require a vote of the General Assembly, so I'm sure we'll be talking with them as well." Trump's aversion to absentee ballots is perhaps most striking because Republicans' recent success in Florida elections — in Trump's home state — has coincided with the state GOP's mastery of mail-in voting. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles has been a longtime proponent of early voting in the state and helped Trump see the benefit to him across swing states in 2024. But his message, that the practice is inherently corrupt, has altered the landscape in Florida, allowing Democrats to ramp up their efforts and, for the first time, take an edge in vote-by-mail ballots — even as Trump won the state in 2020 and 2024. “For years, you had to build into turnout plans the fact that the GOP would have a big advantage in vote by mail,” Steve Schale, a longtime Florida Democratic operative who was an early advocate of his party’s better using mail ballots, said in a message to NBC News. “There was a time when Republicans owned and relied on voting by mail,” said longtime Republican operative Mac Stipanovich, who helped build Florida’s vote-by-mail program but left the GOP over disagreements with Trump. Bob Martinez, said the idea of expanding vote-by-mail to make it easier for all voters to cast ballots is “anathema to the Trump Republican Party, in which voter suppression is dressed up as preventing voter fraud.” Florida Gov. “Our theory is if they had the luxury of checking a box in that general election return ballot that said, ‘Please keep my vote by mail request valid,’ then we could have continued to send them their vote-by-mail ballot for the special election.” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, a DeSantis appointee and Trump supporter, did not reply to a request for comment about Trump’s renewed push to crack down on voting by mail. We will challenge any unlawful executive order and will beat this unconstitutional attempt to disenfranchise millions of Americans." Oregon conducts its elections entirely by mail, and it was the first state to hold a presidential election by mail. If he had any inclination to actually understand or care about the American people, he'd know that mail-in voting is really the best way to protect everybody's right to vote, and that's especially true for rural folks, for elderly people and for people who work for an hourly wage." Read also pointed to the states' constitutional role in deciding how to conduct elections, adding, "I'm going to protect the rights of Oregonians and the rights of the state to choose how we elect our representatives. This is a real threat." Some Trump allies say no one should be surprised by his desire to stop mail-in balloting, as he has long decried the practice of voting in any way other than in person on Election Day.

Article: Rebels backed by ISIL (ISIS) have killed at least 52 civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this month, according to the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) in the country, as both the DRC army and Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group accuse each other of violating a recently reached US-mediated ceasefire deal. Attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) targeted the Beni and Lubero territories of the eastern North Kivu province between August 9 and 16, MONUSCO said on Monday, warning that the death toll could rise further. The renewed violence comes as a separate conflict between the DRC army and the M23 group continues to simmer in the east of the country, despite a series of peace treaties signed in recent months. The latest ADF “violence was accompanied by kidnappings, looting, the burning of houses, vehicles, and motorcycles, as well as the destruction of property belonging to populations already facing a precarious humanitarian situation,” MONUSCO said. “When they arrived, they first woke the residents, gathered them in one place, tied them up with ropes, and then began to massacre them with machetes and hoes,” Macaire Sivikunula, chief of Lubero’s Bapere sector, told the Reuters news agency over the weekend. Advertisement After a relative lull in recent months, authorities said the group killed nearly 40 people in Komanda city, Ituri province, last month, when it stormed a Catholic church during a vigil and fired on worshippers, including many women and children. The ADF, an armed group formed by former Ugandan rebels in the 1990s after discontent with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has killed thousands of civilians and increased looting and killings in the northeastern DRC. Among the 52 victims so far this month, at least nine were killed overnight from Saturday to Sunday in an attack on the town of Oicha, in North Kivu, the AFP news agency learned from security and local sources. A few days earlier, the ADF had already killed at least 40 people in several towns in the Bapere sector, also in North Kivu province, according to local and security sources.

Data compiled by a Sweden-based organization that advocates for democracy globally found in an October 2024 report found that 34 countries or territories allow mail-in voting, which it refers to as “postal voting.” Dozens of countries allow at least some mail-in voting The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance found that of the 34 countries or territories, 12 allow all voters to vote by mail and in 22 permit only some voters to vote this way. All Canadians are eligible to use mail-in voting, said York University associate professor Cary Wu, who co-wrote a 2024 paper about the effect of Trump’s anti-mail voting messaging on Canadians’ views of mail voting. In the United Kingdom, on-demand postal voting in Britain was part of a wider modernization in electoral administration in the early 2000s, according to a 2021 paper by United Kingdom researchers. States set mail-in voting laws In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that “the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the president tells them. UCLA election law professor Rick Hasen wrote on his blog that Trump’s statement is “wrong and dangerous.” “The Constitution does not give the President any control over federal elections,” Hasen wrote, adding that federal courts have recognized those limits.

Article: In mid-July, the State Board of Elections began formally an effort that seeks to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s Justice Department that focused on voter registration records that lacked either a voter's driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Federal and state laws have directed that election officials request this ID information since 2004, but for about a decade the state’s registration form failed to make clear that voters were supposed to provide it if they had it. A ” Registration Repair Project” supported by the now Republican-controlled state board — flipped from a Democratic majority in the spring — created a public online database with the names of 103,270 registrants the lacking the numerical identifiers. As planned, the board is now sending letters to those who haven't already acted and offered a numerical ID, or have yet to indicate that they have neither a driver's license nor a Social Security number. It’s free,” board Executive Director Sam Hayes said, adding that taking action now will "avoid any issues the next time they show up to vote.” People on the list who don't provide the information will have to vote provisionally the next time they cast a ballot — meaning their ballots may not count in some state and local races without correct ID information. Another mailing will go out at a later date to close to 100,000 additional voters whose records also lack the identifiers but will be allowed to continue casting regular ballots because there’s evidence, for example, that they supplied a number or an alternate ID as allowed under the law.

Article: A drug dealer dubbed the “Ketamine Queen” has agreed to plead guilty to five federal criminal charges, including that she provided the drug that ultimately led actor Matthew Perry to suffer a fatal overdose in October 2023, federal prosecutors announced Monday. Sangha supplied the ketamine the “Friends” actor injected on the day of his death, according to the plea agreement, which also noted that she sold drugs for years out of her North Hollywood apartment, described in a federal indictment as the “Sangha stash house.” As part of a deal struck with federal prosecutors, Sangha admitted to knowingly distributing ketamine to Perry, whose struggles with drug addiction and numerous rehab visits were well documented. Perry, who had become addicted to intravenous ketamine, started purchasing the powerful drug from a Southern California doctor in late September 2023, according to the indictment and law enforcement officials. Shortly after the Los Angeles Times and TMZ published news of Perry’s death, according to the plea agreement, Sangha called Fleming on the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss how to distance themselves from it. Does K stay in your system or is it immediately flushed out[?].” Sangha, who has been in custody for the past year, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison on the drug-involved premises count, up to 10 years for each ketamine distribution count and up to 15 years for the count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury. As part of the formal guilty plea in the coming weeks, she will also admit to using her North Hollywood residence to store, package, and distribute narcotics since at least June 2019.

Article: Idaho murders: New details reveal what surviving roommate saw and heard in the house A photo posted by Kaylee Goncalves shows University of Idaho students Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Goncalves. When investigators were working to solve the University of Idaho quadruple murders, what at first appeared to be an early lead to help gauge the killer's familiarity with the victims quickly evaporated as the only surviving witness started to remember more details from that night. 13, 2022 she "was awoken and opened her room door" and "heard a male say 'it's ok Kaylee, I'm here for you,'" referring to one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves, according to newly released documents. "She has been working through it to try to remember what happened." Defense attorney Anne Taylor repeatedly questioned Mortensen's credibility as a witness, saying she "had too much to drink and couldn't remember" and "said things that were just absolutely untrue and couldn't have been true." Prosecutors pushed back, saying while versions of Mortensen's story varied, she was consistent enough, and the judge ultimately sided with prosecutors. The newly-released documents revealed that Mortensen said she heard who she thought was Goncalves walking upstairs toward her third floor room and "heard Kaylee say 'someone's here,' and she sounded frantic," according to the police interview. Mortensen "believed it was Kaylee who was walking up the stairs with [her dog] Murphy," then "heard who she believed to be Kaylee running down the stairs," the interview said. Mortensen said Murphy -- who didn't usually bark -- "was barking at this time." Four University of Idaho students were found dead at an off-campus home on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, in November 2022. "She then heard a male voice, which she stated she had never heard before, say 'It's okay, I'm going to help you.'" She said the male voice was not victim Ethan Chapin, who was asleep in his girlfriend Xana Kernodle's second-floor bedroom at the time. Kernodle -- who investigators say may have interrupted admitted killer Bryan Kohberger on the third floor -- was then attacked near her second-floor bedroom, suffering over 50 stab wounds, a police report said. "She described the suspect as not being muscular, but being skinny and toned, like a basketball player." "She looked down the hallway to Xana's bedroom and could see Xana lying on her back in her underwear, but she thought at the time Xana was passed out," according to the interview. "She said there were people coming in and out of their house all the time." Dylan Mortensen gets a hug after speaking at the sentencing hearing of Bryan Kohberger after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. Moscow police lead detective Brett Payne tracked the time, and a state police detective "walked through the residence with me calling out the number of strikes to simulate the number of wounds to each victim, based on autopsy reports," Gilbertson wrote. Gilbertson said he "conducted two timed runs, the first being a quick as possible run and the second a slower, deliberate timed run" during which he was quiet and more "methodical." Bryan Kohberger, 30, appears for his sentencing hearing after he was convicted in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four Idaho college students, at the Ada County Courthouse, in Boise, Idaho, July 23, 2025. "The timed runs revealed that it was possible for Kohberger to have carried out the murders in as few as two minutes and six seconds, going at a fast pace on the shortest route to the vehicle, or as much as three minutes and forty-five seconds, going at a slower pace on the longer route to the vehicle," the report said. Photos of the crime scene released with the documents show a home common for college Greek life: counters littered with empty hard seltzer cans, wine bottles, snack wrappers and sticks of gum. Kaylee Goncalves/Instagram Goncalves had "jokingly mentioned she thought she had" a "stalker" after someone followed her to her car at the grocery store "a couple months" before the murders, one of the victims' neighbors said, according to the documents. The 22-year-old, who had graduated six months before the murders, described the house "as an 'open door policy,' meaning people were constantly going in and out," according to her interview with police. "Only their close friends would use the sliding glass door in the kitchen." Investigators believe Kohberger used that sliding glass door to slip into the home and fatally stab Goncalves, Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin.

Article: California Democrats on Monday kicked off the process to redraw the state’s congressional districts, an extraordinary action they said was necessary to neutralize efforts by President Trump and Texas Republicans to increase the number of GOP lawmakers in Congress. Gavin Newsom that California must respond to Trump’s efforts to “rig” the 2026 midterms by working to reduced by half the number of Republicans in the state’s 52-member congressional delegation. “But with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight, and when the dust settles on election day, we will win.” Republicans accused Democrats of trying to subvert the will of the voters, who passed independent redistricting 15 years ago, for their own partisan goals. “The citizens seized back control of the power from the politicians in 2010,” said Assemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego), flanked by GOP legislators and signs in the Capitol rotunda that said, “Rigged map” and “Defend fair elections.” Advertisement “Let me be very clear,” DeMaio said. to seize back control.” After Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional districts to add five new GOP members to Congress, Newsom and California Democrats began calling to temporarily reconfigure the current congressional district boundaries, which were drawn by the voter-approved independent redistricting commission in 2021. Advertisement Newsom, other Democratic lawmakers and labor leaders launched a campaign supporting the redrawing of California’s congressional districts on Thursday, and proposed maps were sent to state legislative leaders on Friday. The measures that lawmakers will take up this week would: Give Californians the power to amend the state Constitution and approve new maps, drawn by Democrats, that would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 congressional elections, if any GOP-led states approve their own maps. “We firmly believe that they should cool it, pull back, because if they do, so will California.” Republicans responded by calling for a federal investigation into the California Democratic redistricting plan, and vowed to file multiple lawsuits in state and federal court, including two this week. “We’re going to litigate this every step of the way, but we believe that this will also be rejected at the ballot box, in the court of public opinion,” DeMaio said. He also called for a 10-year ban on holding elected office for state legislators who vote in support of calling the special election, although he did not say how he would try to do that. Advertisement McGuire dismissed the criticism and threats of legal action, saying the Republicans were more concerned about political self-preservation than the will of California voters or the rule of law.

Article: WATCH: Trump promises ‘lasting peace’ in Zelenskyy meeting, says Ukraine peacekeeping force under consideration The talks, which included a second meeting with seven European and NATO leaders, took place three days after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. Since meeting with Putin, Trump has talked about reaching a peace deal saying he no longer thinks Ukraine “needs a ceasefire” and noting that there needs to be concessions on both sides. Following a social media post earlier in the day in which Trump called for getting rid of mail-in voting — a voting practice he had embraced — Trump called mail-in ballots “corrupt” and “a fraud” and promised to end mail-in voting. Trump had a hand in deals that have recently eased conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand; Israel and Iran; and India and Pakistan, although some of those countries’ leaders dispute his role. As Trump spoke about how difficult it’s been to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, he said that, “with all of the wars that I got involved in, we only have this one left.” But his comment notably ignores Israel’s nearly two-year war with Hamas in Gaza that started on Oct. Trump weighed in on Truth Social, saying that “we will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!” $350 billion for Ukraine doesn’t add up. A White House spokesperson told PolitiFact that Trump’s figure included direct funding to Ukraine and indirect economic costs, such as war-related inflation, rising fertilizer costs and lost trade because of sanctions on Russia. Trump’s election “joke.” After a reporter asked if Zelenskyy was open to holding an election — something Trump had criticized him for not doing — he said he would be open to it once the war is over.

Article: Although the term “neoconservative” has fallen into disuse — except as an occasional slur used by the MAGA right, the progressive left and social-media antisemites who really mean to say “Jew” — I’ve never been shy about describing myself as one. Neoconservatism emerged in the early 1970s as a loosely coherent movement of disenchanted liberals who were critical of the welfare state and turned off by the anti-Americanism of parts of the antiwar left. But the movement also took a dim view of the Nixon administration, particularly in its pursuit of arms control with the Soviet Union, its relative indifference to human rights issues behind the Iron Curtain, and its realpolitik approach to foreign policy in general. I learned this the hard way 14 years ago, when Henry Kissinger nearly kicked me out of his Park Avenue office for having the ill grace to ask him about China’s brutal treatment of Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned dissident. Like President Richard Nixon’s, Trump’s politics are a mix of statist economic impulses, populist grievances, the conceit of being above the law and a transactional approach to foreign policy that discounts the moral force of American ideals.

(And they are determined not to take the bait.) It wasn’t so long ago that Trump was praising the nationwide drop in the murder rate — or even that one of his own officials in Washington was specifically touting the drop in violent crime there. By deploying National Guard troops to patrol the streets and seeking control of the local police, his opponents say, Trump is transparently stoking fear for political gain, and exaggerating statistics to justify a power grab. Republicans seized on the pandemic crime spike to win control of the House in 2022 and to help expand Trump’s coalition in 2024, even though rates of violent crime had, by then, begun to recede.

It was the Brazilian's first Premier League double since scoring two against former side Everton in February 2024, while he's the first Spurs player to score two on opening day since Harry Kane in 2019-20 - a season Kane ended with 18 Premier League goals. Just eight more doubles to go… Tijjani Reijnders It was an incredibly impressive debut for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, who became the first player to score and assist on his Premier League debut while playing for Manchester City since Sergio Aguero in August 2011. Only Erling Haaland had both more shots and more touches in the opposition box against Wolves than Reijnders (3 shots, 5 touches in box), while only Nico Gonzalez made more successful final third passes than the Dutchman (20).

Article: "We are demanding that this administration do what they say they're going to do if they're not going to close the camps," Marisa Limon Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, told El Paso ABC affiliate KVIA. "At a minimum, we need access to people who have due process and should have access to attorneys." The criticism came as a federal judge on Monday heard arguments from lawyers for detainees at the Florida detention center known as "Alligator Alcatraz," who say they lack proper attorney access and are being held without any formal criminal or immigration charges against them. Veronica Escobar, who toured the new Texas detention center Monday, said of the facility's price tag, "I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans." "There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration," she said. They have no legal right to be here." "Under President Trump's leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens," Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday. "The One Big Beautiful Bill has provided historic funding to help us carry out this mandate, especially by securing enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds." "The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals," McLaughlin said.

"Our entire city stands with them and is here to support them." Islam, 36, was working in the lobby of the 44-story building on Park Avenue in New York City on July 28 when, police say, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas walked in and immediately opened fire using a semiautomatic rifle. Tisch said afterward that Islam was working in the lobby of the building with the department's permission under a program that allows officers to provide security off-duty but in uniform. After the attack Adams said that those who knew the officer said he “believed in living out the life of a godly person.” Tamura also shot a security guard and two civilians in the building before fatally shooting himself, authorities said. Adams said Tamura, who completed a cross-country drive just prior to the attack, was trying to target the headquarters of the NFL, which has offices in the Park Avenue building, but entered the wrong set of elevator banks and never made it to the league's offices. Two officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the shooter, who played football in high school in Southern California, left a note at the scene that said he wanted his brain studied for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Patrick Hendry, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said after the attack: “He went out every single day to provide for his family, whether it was overtime or whatever he had to do." Tisch said in her statement Monday that the newborn, his mother and his brothers are part of the NYPD fabric.

Article: Geoff Bennett: Leaders from across Europe descended on Washington today in a remarkable show of support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who came to the White House to meet President Trump. Nick Schifrin: In a deal outlined today, Ukraine’s ability to guarantee its security will rely on European troops sent into Ukraine, as well as European weapons and Europe’s purchasing American weapons to be dispatched to Ukraine. Nick Schifrin: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy got by with more than a little help from those friends today, the largest ever gathering of Europeans in Washington outside a NATO summit. Vladimir Putin, Russian President (through translator): We’re convinced, in order to make the settlement extremely lasting and long-term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict. Nick Schifrin: Of course, the European officials who are still meeting with President Trump in the White House behind me believe that the root cause of the war is Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tonight, Vladimir Putin’s top foreign policy aide has confirmed that President Trump called Vladimir Putin in a call that was described as — quote — “frank and constructive.” A senior Ukrainian official participating in the meetings tonight tells me that the Oval Office meeting was — quote — “very good” and the whole day has gone — quote — “more than good,” indicating, Geoff, that at least the Ukrainians, or from their perspective, they have achieved what they sought to achieve today. But they had European unity on their side, including many European leaders whom President Trump has grown quite fond of, and they had momentum already on a key point, security guarantees. officials tell me that Zelenskyy wasn’t expected to say yes tonight, but they expected him not to say no, and to go back to Kyiv and perhaps present a counteroffer. Nick Schifrin: According to Russian media, just out in the last few minutes, they did discuss that trilateral meeting that President Trump has promised and that President Zelenskyy, you heard in the White House today, endorse. They argue that that summit moved the ball along, allowed this meeting today, allowed the phone call between President Trump and President Putin tonight, and that at that summit Putin agreed that these security guarantees could be offered by the United States to Ukraine. And Europe wants to keep pressure on Russia, and, as you heard Rubio and others, senior officials, saying they will not impose more sanctions while these negotiations continue — Geoff.

Article: McALLEN, Texas -- A federal judge ruled Friday to deny the Trump administration's request to end a policy in place for nearly three decades that is meant to protect immigrant children in federal custody. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone," Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement. In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.” Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.

The New Mexico fairgrounds have hosted the powwow since 2017, but it's unclear whether the venue would be available for future events given that the state is considering redeveloping the site. The event also features the crowning of Miss Indian World, as well as horse parades in which riders are judged on the craftsmanship of their intricately beaded adornments or feathered headdresses and how well they work with their steeds.

The letter did not specifically name Ukraine, which Putin's forces invaded in 2022, but beseeched him to think of children and “an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.” Nor did the American first lady discuss the fighting other than to say to Putin that he could “singlehandedly restore” the “melodic laughter” of children who have been caught in the conflict. The Associated Press documented the grabbing of Ukrainian children in 2022, after which the International Criminal Court said it had issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.

Article: Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard What to know about the indictment against the New Orleans mayor FILE - New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell speaks at the police headquarters in New Orleans, Feb. (Chris Granger/The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate via AP, File) NEW ORLEANS -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard. Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as “personal and intimate.” The first female mayor in New Orleans’ 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Here are things to know about the mayor and the indictment: The indictment paints a detailed picture of Cantrell and her bodyguard traveling to vineyards and spending time alone in apartments at the same time it says Vappie was being paid as if he was working. Vappie reminisced in a WhatsApp exchange cited in the indictment about joining Cantrell in Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.” Cantrell had told local reporters she needed a security detail “due to COVID,” saying her travel accommodations were “a matter of safety, not of luxury.” The following year, instead of Cantrell attending a conference in Miami, authorities said the pair rendezvoused on Martha’s Vineyard. The pair used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” he said. She is also among more than 100 people brought up on corruption charges in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans two decades ago, said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a watchdog group that provided photographs and information to federal authorities in the latest case.

Article: Ziva Mann has been navigating the challenges of raising a transgender child within an Orthodox Jewish community Ziva Mann, mother of a transgender child and member of a welcoming synagogue, poses in her garden, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Ziva Mann remembers how joyful and smiley her daughter was as a child — the family even gave her the nickname “Giggles.” “She was just sunshine,” Mann said. So if a trans person is in between transitioning, very often they will be asked not to come to synagogue.” She said even after someone has fully transitioned, rabbis should allow them to sit where they feel comfortable. “Without Eshel, I don’t know how this would have turned out for any of us.” Mann defines herself as modern Orthodox, meaning she strives to uphold Judaic law while embracing the values within her family. “Because a life is more important than all of the rules.” Respecting her daughter’s identity felt akin to saving her life, so Mann didn’t feel the need to talk to God about it. “The strength, the love and the grace to parent a child who’s walking a difficult path.” Mann feels lucky to have found support, both in religious spaces and among family members, which has helped Ellie be her joyful self again. “He’s probably my child that has the strongest commitment to Judaism from an emotional connection." A rabbi told Paneth that Ollie is welcome to come to services, but he would now be expected to sit among the men. “If I was going to survive this, I had to come out with my parents as trans and start medically transitioning.” He had top surgery in 2022 and soon after met his girlfriend at JQY, a program for Jewish LGBTQ+ teens. “Even though I look different, my relationship to God didn’t change.” Kabakov said many LGBTQ+ Jews eventually decide to leave Orthodoxy, but for those who wish to remain, Eshel and some spiritual leaders offer support. Rabbi Mike Moskowitz, who works at an LGBTQ+ synagogue in New York, thinks of his job as helping people understand how they can be their authentic selves and still feel accepted by their religion. “Orthodoxy, the people, are the problem.” The counseling he provides for trans children and their parents is specific to each person, but in general, he offers fresh interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. “Unity is coping through kindness and being able to replace the weight of oppression with the elevation of love.” ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Greece’s conservative government last month suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week. It is preparing draft legislation, to be submitted after the summer recess, that would mandate imprisonment for migrants whose asylum claims are denied and require ankle monitors during a 30-day compliance period before deportation.

Article: welcoming Russian President Vladimir Putin with a red carpet in Alaska KYIV, Ukraine -- In Kyiv, Ukrainians living under near daily Russian bombardment watched with astonishment as their country’s most important ally rolled out a red carpet in Alaska for the man they blame for over three years of war, bloodshed and loss. The red carpet treatment, the lack of concrete decisions for Ukraine and, most significantly, neglecting the significance of sanctions — a policy that could turn the tide in Kyiv’s favor — have felt like a betrayal for Ukrainians who have borne enormous suffering in the almost three-and-a-half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian servicemen, the country’s bravest and most skilled, have been killed and wounded, thousands of civilians have been killed in Russian strikes, and a fifth of the country is under occupation, severing families, properties and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time in a decade that Putin had stepped foot in the U.S., ending international isolation spurred by the 2022 Ukraine invasion; in other words, it was a win.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic) BELGRADE, Serbia -- Angry protesters clashed with police in a town in western Serbia and in the capital Belgrade on Saturday as tensions soared further in the Balkan nation following days of violent demonstrations. Wearing scarves over their faces and chanting slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic, a group of young men threw flares at his Serbian Progressive Party offices in Valjevo, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital Belgrade. Similar clashes also erupted on Saturday evening in the northern city of Novi Sad and in Belgrade, with police directing tear gas at protesters while battling the protesters who set garbage containers on fire. The protest in Valjevo drew several thousand people after a video on social media showed a young man from the town being severely beaten by police who kicked him and bashed him with batons during a protest earlier this week. Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, has called for “calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly” “Serbian authorities must uphold Council of Europe standards,” he said on X this week.

Article: Pope Leo XIV is marking his first 100 days in office, showing a mix of continuity with and change from Pope Francis' papacy VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the “salt of the Earth, the light of the world.” He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go. As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. “Even those who really loved Pope Francis always kind of held their breath a little bit: You didn’t know what was going to come out next or what he was going to do,” Hughes said. Leo has certainly gone out of his way in his first 100 days to try to heal divisions that deepened during Francis’ pontificate, offering messages of unity and avoiding controversy at almost every turn. He has furthered that legacy by giving the go-ahead for the Vatican to turn a 430-hectare (1,000-acre) field north of Rome into a vast solar farm that should generate enough electricity to meet Vatican City’s needs and turn it into the world’s first carbon-neutral state. He has fine-tuned financial transparency regulations that Francis initiated, tweaked some other decrees to give them consistency and logic, and confirmed Francis in deciding to declare one of the 19th century’s most influential saints, John Henry Newman, a “doctor” of the church. Compared to President Donald Trump, the other American world leader who took office in 2025 with a flurry of Sharpie-penned executive decrees, Leo has eased into his new job slowly, deliberately and quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to himself. Maria Isabel Ibarcena Cuarite, a Peruvian member of a Catholic charismatic group, said it was precisely Leo’s quiet emphasis on church traditions, its sacraments and love of Christ, that drew her and upward of 1 million young people to Rome for a special Jubilee week this month. Peter's a few times since his election, and some wonder if he will invite some brothers to live with him in the Apostolic Palace to recreate the spirit of Augustinian community life there. Given Francis’ stump speech before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope, the then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio essentially described Prevost in identifying the church's mission today: He said the church was "called to go outside of itself and go to the peripheries, not just geographic but also the existential peripheries.” Prevost, who hails from Chicago, spent his adult life as a missionary in Peru, eventually becoming bishop of Chiclayo. “He is the incarnation of the ‘unity of difference,’ because he comes from the center, but he lives in the peripheries,” said Emilce Cuda, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Prevost has recounted that at one point when he was the Augustinian superior, the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires expressed interest in assigning an Augustinian priest to a specific job in his archdiocese. “And I, as prior general, said ‘I understand, Your Eminence, but he’s got to do something else’ and so I transferred him somewhere else,” Prevost told parishioners in his home state of Illinois in 2024.

Article: Nigeria's national security adviser has announced the arrest of two militant leaders on the country's most wanted list Nigeria says it has arrested 2 militant leaders on its most wanted list LAGOS, Nigeria -- The leaders of two militant groups on Nigeria 's most wanted list have been arrested in an operation involving multiple agencies, the West African country's national security adviser said Saturday. Officials said the arrests came in an operation conducted between May and July and that they recovered valuable materials including digital evidence that is undergoing forensic analysis and could lead to more arrests. He said the arrested leaders are responsible for the Kuje prison attack in 2022 that led to the escape of dozens of jailed Boko Haram members and an attack on the Niger uranium facility in 2013, among others. Ribadu said they maintain “active links with terrorist groups across the Maghreb, particularly in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.” Nigeria faces a complex, multidimensional security challenge with various armed groups operating across the country. Oluwole Ojewale, a Dakar-based security analyst at the Institute of Security Studies, says the significant arrest will test the resilience of Ansaru and its capacity to spring surprises or mount major attacks in the immediate term.

Article: Of the 92% S & P 500 companies that have reported, 60% have beaten consensus earnings per share forecasts by more than a standard deviation of analyst estimates, according to data from the firm. "With the 2Q 2025 earnings season nearly complete, the quarter has been marked by one of the greatest frequency of earnings beats on record," wrote David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. He also said that profit margins for the S & P 500 have been "more resilient to tariffs than investors feared." "While we expect companies will generally be able to mitigate tariff costs and maintain their profit margins, the magnitude of margin expansion embedded in consensus estimates appears unrealistic," he continued. "We expect the strong recent trajectory of analyst earnings revisions to weaken going forward, but no more than the average downward trend of the last few decades." This might be a double-edged sword, however, as this strong season has led to a ratcheting up of earnings per share forecasts for the future. To be sure, Kostin said that analysts still foresee a deceleration in S & P 500 earnings per share growth in the months ahead, dropping to 7% in the second half from 11% in the second quarter.

These include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts. People have to move before the infrastructure fails." The iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; £737m). "We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lampposts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway." Among the most delicate aspects of the move is the protection of the church's interior treasures, especially its great altar painting made by Prince Eugen, a member of Sweden's royal family.

"The move has brought back memories of joy and sorrow to us, and we're now moving those memories with us into the future." That feeling is also shared by project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, an engineer who doubles as a member of the church's gospel choir.

That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling - affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. Elisenda Balleste The core of mud is carefully removed from the drill and kept intact for analysis A history of ocean life Researchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. This is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting. Victoria Gill/BBC The Antarctic is a feeding ground for whales and other marine life Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. It is part of a mission - the Convex Seascape Survey - which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. "Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time," she said.

Article: Why India tops the list of abandoned sailors 41 minutes ago Share Save Neyaz Farooquee BBC News, Delhi Share Save BBC An Indian crew member of Anka cargo vessel, which is abandoned at an Ukrainian port since April Manas Kumar* has been abandoned on a cargo ship in Ukrainian waters since April. The Indian seaman was part of a crew of 14 transporting popcorn to Turkey from Moldova when the vessel was raided on 18 April, as it made its way down the Danube river which divides Ukraine and Romania. But exactly who owns the ship is not clear from the papers provided by the crew, made up of Mr Kumar, five other Indian nationals, as well as two Azerbaijanis and six Egyptians. The problem is disembarking means the crew losing their salaries - amounting to $102,828 by June all together, according to a joint database of abandoned ships maintained by International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). But it also tops the list of crew members known as "abandoned seafarers" - a term used by 2006 Maritime Labour Convention to describe the situation when shipowners sever ties with the crew and fail to provide them for repatriation, regular provisions and wages. According to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers globally, there were 3,133 abandoned sailors across 312 ships in 2024 - of which Indian nationals accounted for 899. For many, leaving the ship without a salary is not possible - especially if they have already paid hefty sums to agents for landing the job or for acquiring training certifications, Mohammad Gulam Ansari, a former seafarer who helps repatriate Indian crew from other parts of the world, tells the BBC. Crew members of Nirvana vessel cooking food on the ship The most significant reason for abandonment is the widespread practice of registering ships - called flags of convenience - in countries that have weak shipping rules, according to ITF. "A country can set up a ship registry and charge fees to shipowners, while having reduced standards for crew safety and welfare and often failing to live up to the responsibilities of a genuine flag state," the ITF website states. BBC/ITF Crew members of Nirvana vessel were repatriated after months at the sea but continue to wait for their salaries Seafarers often blame India's maritime regulator, Directorate General (DG) of Shipping - which is tasked with verifying the credentials of ships, their owners and recruitment and placement agencies - for lax scrutiny of stakeholders. "When you are hired, you get enough time to inform the DG Shipping [about any discrepancies in your contract]," said Sushil Deorukhkar, an ITF representative working for the welfare of the seafarers. "Once you sign the papers, you are stuck and have to knock on every door for resolution." Things can get complicated even for the crew on Indian-owned ships operating within the country's waters for a variety of reasons. In early April, Mr Singh was taking it to a port in western India's Gujarat state for dismantling when an Indian court ordered its seizure "for non-payment of crew", according to the ILO-IMO database.

Article: toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR "Everybody looks and waits for this first weekend [of August] to come to Langford," says Richard Love, one of the officials at the 79th annual competition this year. "It's grassroots, it's motorsports — this place is unbelievable." Tractor pulling was created in the 1920s by farmers wanting to show off their machines and have something to look forward to, says Love. This event in Langford has been held annually since 1946, even hosting limited runs during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain its position as the longest-running event of its kind in the country. Sponsor Message Rules of the Road In the competition, tractors and trucks latch onto a contraption called a sled, which looks like a flat-bed trailer carrying a huge weighted box on a slider. Horsepower meets tradition "The crowd is just electric here – I mean, these people come to see tractor and truck pulling and they just love it here," says Kelly Giltinan, the driver behind the wheel of a red pulling truck called "Bull Headed," fit with a 1955 chassis and a chrome-plated modern engine. Sponsor Message Giltinan, who came from Pennsylvania, says that driving in a pull is a bit different from driving on the road because his truck only runs in one gear, and its engine is specially designed to produce as much power as possible in as little time as possible. "I mean, this horsepower you can feel in your chest." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Giltinan's trip to Langford didn't go as he'd hoped — the pulling sled heavily damaged the back of his truck on his first attempt, which prevented him from making any more runs at Langford. "It's in your blood, you just love making horsepower." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR Like NASCAR, but for tractors and trucks While drivers like Giltinan get all the glory, each competitor typically has a whole team of people supporting them behind the scenes. "The team behind building them is just as important as a driver," Meals explained, "If you don't have a good driver, you can have the biggest motor you want, but it's still going to fall short." toggle caption Zach Jaworski for NPR One local, 20-year-old Matt Sweet, said that he's been coming every year since he was born, and his father has been attending since 1975. Sponsor Message "The little kids love it – they run down the side of the track, chasing the tractors and in the pits, [and] the drivers will let them sit in the seats," says Sweet, reminded of when he was in those kid's position, "it's very nostalgic, seeing that, I just really get a full circle moment."

Article: North Korea has long denounced the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and Kim has often used them to justify his own military displays and testing activities aimed at expanding his nuclear weapons program. While inspecting the warship Choe Hyon, a 5,000-ton-class destroyer first unveiled in April, Kim said the allies’ joint military drills show hostility and their supposed “will to ignite a war,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency said. “The security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day and the prevailing situation requires us to make a radical and swift change in the existing military theory and practice and rapid expansion of nuclearization,” KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The government of South Korea’s new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who has expressed a willingness to repair ties and resume dialogue with the North, did not immediately respond to Kim’s comments. military officials say Ulchi Freedom Shield will focus on countering North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threat and will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks. The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks. Kim has hailed the development of his naval destroyer, Choe Hyon, as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military. The North unveiled a second destroyer of the same class in May, but the vessel was damaged during a botched launching ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin, prompting an angry reaction from Kim, who called the failure “criminal.” The North has said the new destroyer, named Kang Kon, was relaunched in June after repair, but some outside experts have questioned whether the ship is fully operational. While inspecting Choe Hyon, Kim expressed satisfaction with the progress of the warship’s weapons tests and its integrated operations system, saying the navy’s modernization and move toward nuclear-capable capabilities are proceeding as planned. His government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Washington and Seoul to revive negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear and missile programs, which derailed in 2019 following a collapsed summit with U.S. In his latest message to Pyongyang on Friday, Lee, who took office in June, said he would seek to restore a 2018-inter-Korean military agreement designed to reduce border tensions and called for North Korea to respond to the South’s efforts to rebuild trust and revive talks. The 2018 military agreement, reached during a brief period of diplomacy between the Koreas, created buffer zones on land and sea and no-fly zones above the border to prevent clashes. But South Korea suspended the deal in 2024, citing tensions over North Korea’s launches of trash-laden balloons toward the South, and moved to resume front line military activities and propaganda campaigns.

Article: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has agreed to provide to Congress documents from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, a key House lawmaker said Monday in announcing a move that appears to avert, at least temporarily, a potential separation of powers clash. The records are to be turned over starting Friday to the House Oversight Committee, which earlier this month issued a broad subpoena to the Justice Department about a criminal case that has long captivated public attention, recently roiled the top rungs of President Donald Trump's administration and been a consistent magnet for conspiracy theories. “There are many records in DOJ’s custody, and it will take the Department time to produce all the records and ensure the identification of victims and any child sexual abuse material are redacted,” Kentucky Rep. It also demanded records about communications between Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein, as well as documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement. It was not clear exactly which or how many documents might be produced or whether the cooperation with Congress reflected a broader change in posture since last month, when the FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing any additional records from the Epstein investigation after determining that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted." That announcement put the Trump administration on the defensive, with officials since then scrambling both to tamp down angry questions from the president's base and also laboring to appear transparent. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell at a Florida courthouse over two days last month — though no records from those conversations have been made public — and the Justice Department has also sought to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases, though so far those requests have been denied.

Article: Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Monday against a ticket broker, alleging the company used illegal tactics to exceed purchasing limits for popular events and then resold tickets at significantly higher prices. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland, the FTC said Maryland-based ticket broker Key Investment Group has used thousands of fictitious Ticketmaster accounts and other methods to buy tickets for events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. According to the FTC, Key Investment Group – which does business under brand names like Epic Seats and Totally Tix – purchased at least 379,776 tickets from Ticketmaster between Nov. For just one Taylor Swift concert, Key Investment Group allegedly used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets, dramatically exceeding the Eras Tour’s 2023 six-ticket purchase limit per event, the FTC said. Key Investment Group said the FTC is misapplying the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, a 2016 law which it said was meant to target malicious software, not legitimate resale businesses. Key Investment Group sued the FTC in July to try to prevent the agency from using the law against it, saying it uses human employees — not bots — to buy tickets. The order also directed the FTC to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process” and to “take enforcement action to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary ticketing market."

Article: TORONTO, ON — The union for 10,000 striking Air Canada flight attendants said Monday they won’t return to work even though the strike, now in its third day, has been declared illegal. The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada’s labor laws, had said the union needed to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties. Our members want a solution here, but solution has to be found at the bargaining table.” It was not immediately clear what recourse the board or the government have if the union continues to refuse. Labor leaders are objecting to the Canadian government’s repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere. “I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.” Carney said it was disappointing that the talks have not led to a deal, and he stressed it was important that flight attendants are compensated fairly at all times. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout. “We’re obviously hoping we can go tomorrow, but we’ll make that decision later today,” Rousseau said on BNN Bloomberg shortly after the union announced it would continue with the strike. Disrupted tourists, stranded passengers Montreal resident Robert Brzymowski has been stranded in Prague along with his wife and their two children since Saturday, when Air Canada canceled their flight home from what was meant to be a two-week vacation visiting relatives. Brzymowski, who consults businesses on energy-efficient practices, said he was set to start a new job Monday but lost out on the contract because he wasn’t back in Montreal in time. The worst thing is the amount of anxiety it’s caused.” Frustrated by what he described as a lack of communication from the airline, Brzymowski said he went to the airport in Prague on Monday morning in search of answers. Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren’t in the air. The airline’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.” But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn’t go far enough because of inflation.

At his opening appearance in the Oval Office, Zelensky spoke little - or maybe he was not keen to, fearing that what he had to say was different from what Trump wanted to hear. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron both said a ceasefire in Ukraine should be the next step, even though Trump had argued that it was not necessary before a more permanent solution is found. Getty Images What we heard from the leaders suggests that their discussions behind closed doors focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and prospects for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin. At an earlier news conference outside the White House, he said security guarantees could include a $90bn (£67bn) deal between Kyiv and Washington to acquire US weapons, including aviation systems, anti-missile systems and other weapons he declined to disclose. The Ukranian leader, however, was more willing to talk about his possible meeting with Putin, telling reporters he was ready to meet directly with his Russian counterpart, and if Moscow agreed, Trump could join the negotiations.

Lawyers for Boyd filed a federal lawsuit in July — about a month after the state began asking for his execution date — seeking to prevent the state from executing him with nitrogen. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser who witnessed the first nitrogen execution and is now working with Boyd, said Monday that he was “horrified” by what he saw at that execution, which he described as being “suffocated to death.” The Alabama attorney general’s office has urged a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that there is “substantial evidence that nitrogen hypoxia is a painless way to die.” The state argued the described movements in previous executions were either inmates actively resisting or “involuntary movements associated with dying.” Huguley’s burned body was found Aug.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to convene a face-to-face summit between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his latest bid to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Trump’s proposal on Monday came as he hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, at the White House for high-stakes talks on ending the conflict, which has raged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said he had “begun arrangements” for the summit after speaking with Putin by phone, and that he would hold a trilateral meeting with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts following their two-way meeting. “Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, are coordinating with Russia and Ukraine.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte separately confirmed that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, but did not specify a date or location. Moscow did not immediately confirm that it had agreed to a summit, but Russia’s state-run TASS news agency cited presidential aide Yuri Ushakov as saying that Putin and Trump “spoke in favour of continuing direct talks” between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. Advertisement The proposals for a summit, which would be the first meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy since Moscow’s invasion, came as the fraught issue of security guarantees for Ukraine took centre stage during the talks at the White House. Asked if the US could send peacekeepers to Ukraine, Trump said that European countries would be the “first line of defence”, but that Washington would provide “a lot of help”. While Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, his special envoy, Witkoff, said on Sunday that Putin was open to a security guarantee resembling the 32-member alliance’s collective defence mandate. Speaking on Fox News after Monday’s talks, Rutte called Washington’s commitment to be involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security a “breakthrough”, but said the exact nature of that involvement would be discussed over the coming days. “What we all agree on is that if this war does come to end… it has to be definitive – that Russia will never, ever, ever again try to get a catch a square mile of territory of Ukraine post a peace deal,” Rutte said. Konstantin Sonin, a Russian exile and Putin critic who is a professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, said that meaningful security guarantees for Kyiv would need to include European troops on the ground. “This is all ‘unacceptable’ to Putin, so for European leaders, it is the question how to persuade President Trump that without such guarantees, the war, even if it stops now, will start again in the near future,” Sonin told Al Jazeera. “Russia has signed many international treaties recognising Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders – including Putin himself signing one such treaty in 2004 – and still violated all of these treaties, both in 2014 and 2022,” Sonin said. And that’s been true in every war.” Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly ruled out handing over Ukrainian territory to Moscow, said on Monday that land would be an issue for him and Putin to work out between them.

Article: There must be a push for peace to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, but French President Emmanuel Macron is skeptical that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to resolve the conflict. “When I look at the situation and the facts, I don’t see President Putin very willing to get peace now,” Macron told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview Monday after a high-stakes White House meeting Monday. So if he considers he can get a deal done, this is great news, and we have to do whatever we can to have a great deal.” Macron insisted that the United States must apply pressure to Russia and Putin to find a resolution, including introducing more sanctions. If there is no progress in the bilateral meeting President Donald Trump announced between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and if a trilateral meeting falls through, “or if the Russians don’t comply with this approach, yes, we have to increase the sanctions, secondary and primary sanctions,” Macron said. There is a country which decided to kill people, stole children and who refused a ceasefire and peace, so we cannot just create an equivalent situation between Ukraine and Russia.” Ukraine must be given security guarantees to prevent any future Russian attacks that could prolong the conflict or start a new war, Macron said after his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and top European leaders. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, “I do hope,” noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States. Putin kept up the pressure in the lead-up to the talks with deadly attacks in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia overnight, seemingly trying to push Zelenskyy to meet what are thought to be sweeping demands for Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Macron said there should not be any land swapping, as Trump has suggested, particularly because there have been long periods during the Russian-started war that its military was not able make significant gains in taking control of Ukrainian land. “What’s happening in Ukraine is extremely important for Ukrainian people, obviously, but for the whole security of Europe, because we speak about containing a nuclear power, which decided just not to respect international borders anymore.

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- A Harris County Precinct 1 deputy constable seen in a video pulling a gun following a family dispute remains under investigation as her attorney says the public is only seeing part of the story. Brown, who was in uniform at the time but off duty, according to Precinct 1, is seen pointing a firearm at the man while demanding the return of her sister's phone. The man recording the incident told ABC13 that he had taken the phone during an argument with the mother of his child, Brown's sister, and was later confronted by Brown herself, who allegedly chased him down in her personal vehicle. "At that time, she believed her sister had been assaulted and kidnapped by the perpetrator." According to Bolin, Brown first called Harris County Precinct 4 for help to respond to her sister's address but then saw her phone in motion via a tracking app and feared she had been taken against her will. When she realized her sister wasn't in that vehicle, she took the phone that was her sister's and continued to check on her well-being." The one-minute video does not include any mention of Brown's concern for her sister's whereabouts. Prior to that, she was employed by the Lone Star College Police Department, where records obtained by ABC13 through an open records request, show she had been disciplined for conduct violations, including the use of profanity.

"The investment comes as both Intel and SoftBank deepen their commitment to investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation in the United States," the two companies said in a joint statement. On Thursday, the company declined to comment on the reported discussions and said it was "deeply committed to supporting President Trump's efforts" to strengthen manufacturing and technology in the US. Such an agreement would mark a "major escalation" in what seems to be an attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the US government's role in the private sector, said political scientist Sarah Bauerle Danzman from Indiana University.

Article: Nicole Collier must remain on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives after declining to sign a document Monday that would assign her a law enforcement escort to monitor her movements across the state, according to a news release. Earlier this month, dozens of House Democrats left the state, many to Chicago, to prevent a quorum and stall a special legislative session focused on redrawing the state’s congressional maps. Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and former chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus who represents a majority-minority district, said she will not submit to what she described as intimidation tactics. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts,” Collier said in a statement. "When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents — I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” Democratic colleagues have voiced support for Collier’s decision and called on House leadership to restore public access to the chamber galleries, which were closed during the standoff.

MSNBC, which got its original name from a now-defunct partnership between NBC and Microsoft, has been on a quest to forge an independent identity as its opinion journalism with a progressive slant has created headaches for NBC, which has maintained a more neutral editorial tone. Not just a name change Like an adult in their early 20s finally moving from their parents’ house, MSNBC is in the process of becoming operationally self-sufficient as it separates from its corporate cousin, NBC. The two networks are moving away from sharing on-air talent, and MSNBC has been on a hiring spree to beef up its newsgathering prowess so it doesn’t have to rely on NBC for scoops. Aside from new-hire editors and producers, it recently brought on several NBC News personalities, including correspondents Jacob Soboroff and Vaughn Hillyard, as well as political reporters from Politico and the Washington Post. Big picture: Though MSNBC does well in the nightly eyeballs game—surpassing CNN to receive the second-highest primetime ratings among cable news channels—it lags behind Fox News, which had more than double the primetime viewers last quarter, according to Nielsen Live+SD data.—SK

Two European leaders — Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France — pointedly said while reporters were in the room as the meeting started that moving forward would require a cease-fire, something Mr. Trump in the Oval Office after the call was finished, according to a White House official who spoke anonymously because the person was not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.

Article: Soho House, an exclusive club that ironically boasts more than 200,000 members worldwide, reached a $2.7 billion agreement to go private yesterday after four rocky years as a publicly traded entity. Since its IPO in 2021, Soho House has struggled both in the market—its IPO price was $14 per share back then, while shares closed below $8 on Friday—and in keeping its clientele of creative types happy as membership numbers exploded and competition flourished: In 2021, there were 33 Soho Houses; today, there are 48 operating or scheduled to open around the world. While that seems to contradict the point of an “exclusive” club, new venues means new members paying annual fees between $4,500 and $5,800, which bolsters the bottom line and placates shareholders.

(AP Photo/Adlai Coleman) Michael Deng Dut, 29 years-old, who says he was electrocuted more than 18 times after his arrest by the Sudanese Armed Forces, poses for a photo during an interview with The Associated Press in Renk, South Sudan, Thursday, Aug 7, 2025. This July, he finally crossed the border back into his native South Sudan, taking a deep breath and reminding himself, “I am alive.” After everything that has happened to him, it feels like a miracle. Sudan — once his place of refuge — has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023 that has killed 40,000 people and displaced nearly 13 million more, according to UN agencies. There had been incursions into the area by the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force once known as the Janjaweed who were notorious for mass killings, rapes and other atrocities in Darfur two decades ago. More recently, the RSF have again been accused of by the International Criminal Court of committing war crimes, including the attacks on famine-hit Zamzam and other camps in North Darfur. human rights body detailed how both the SAF and the RSF have detained tens of thousands of people “without charge, with limited or no contact with their families, in squalid and overcrowded facilities” in “a widespread pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment.” Abdullah can attest to this. “Even when you shouted to them,” said Abdullah, “they would tell you, ‘if you want to die also, you can die with them.’” The Associated Press spoke to eight men in total, some of whom were detained in other prisons in Al Jazirah State and Khartoum. One man, Michael Deng Dut, 29, said he had been “tortured with electricity more than 18 times.” Simon Tong, 39, said that he was tortured with a knife during an interrogation, and rolled up his sleeve to expose the scars on his arm. “This is the reason many of us passed away,” said Tong, “because of the lack of food and water.” In July, 99 South Sudanese prisoners were separated from the other inmates. When the Sudanese civil war broke out in 2023, UN agencies and the South Sudanese government established an onward transportation program which has moved more than 250,000 people, according to the UN’s International Office of Migration. “All of us, together.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats who ended a walkout found themselves shadowed by law enforcement officers to keep them from repeating the protest that stalled Republican efforts to redraw congressional districts and fulfill President Donald Trump's desire to reshape U.S. Republicans in the Texas House forced returning Democrats to sign what the Democrats called “permission slips,” agreeing to around-the-clock surveillance by state Department of Public Safety officers to leave the floor. "This is a waste of taxpayer dollars and really performative theater.” Collier, who represents a minority-majority district, said she would not “sign away my dignity" and allow Republicans to “control my movements and monitor me.” “I know these maps will harm my constituents,” she said in a statement. "I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their discrimination.” The tit-for-tat puts the nation's two most populous states at the center of an expanding fight over control of Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. “We don’t want this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we cannot run away from this fight,” said Democrat Marc Berman, a California Assembly member who previously chaired the elections committee. Greg Abbott launched the expanding battle when he heeded Trump's wishes and added redistricting to an initial special session agenda that included multiple issues, including a package responding to devastating floods that killed more than 130 people last month.

Article: Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98 WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation’s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said. Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. “Politics Today” began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001. Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book “85 Days.” Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as “friendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains” who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse’s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, “Boys on the Bus.” When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, “we often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it “the most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.” But he did not blame that view for The Sun’s dropping his column. “The war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,” he wrote for the Poynter Institute’s blog. Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training.

Article: Nkrumah was opposed and derided by some fellow African leaders for what they saw as his unrealistic dream of merging dozens of newly formed countries to form a continental government, perhaps with him at the helm. The Ghanaian leader saw this move toward larger units, both economically and politically, as a matter of successive voluntary steps — with states joining to integrate their markets and road and rail networks, then perhaps merging at the subregional level before any eventual attempt to form a nation that would encompass, say, all of West, East or Southern Africa. This was the future he saw for his continent, as he explained to his peers at the founding summit of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1963.

Article: Alex Livesey | Getty Images European soccer is a bigger business than ever, with clubs in the continent's five top leagues raking in 20.4 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in revenue in the 2023-2024 season — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie. You can only have so many helicopters, you can only have so many super yachts." According to Maguire, the small number of top professional sports teams available to purchase has also contributed to rising demand, with investors unable to meet the multi-billion dollar price tags attached to NFL or NBA teams in the U.S. Private equity More than 36 of clubs in Europe's five biggest leagues now have private equity, venture capital or private debt participation through majority or minority stakes, including a majority of clubs in the Premier League, according to PitchBook research. But the increasing prevalence of multi-club ownership has risked the ire of regulators, with Moura saying that European soccer body UEFA is "starting to crack down on clubs." This summer, England's Crystal Palace was barred from participating in UEFA's Europa League competition due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. Moura says the decision — which Crystal Palace labelled as an "injustice" — could become more of an issue as more clubs involved in multi-club structures move into Europe's top divisions. The growth of soccer revenues has slowed in recent years, with Deloitte saying it sees income "plateauing" in the 2025-26 season on the back of slowing growth in the value of sports media rights. That has left commercial revenue — up 6% in the 2023-24 season, per Deloitte — as a main driver, as clubs clinched new sponsorship deals and looked to utilize stadiums for non-soccer events. Until now, games in domestic leagues have not been allowed to be played outside of their home country, with global governing body FIFA considering a formal change to its rules on overseas matches. Maguire says Premier League clubs will eventually look to hold games overseas to compete with rival European leagues, and that the money generated will mean games "will be sold to the fan base … effectively as a fait accompli." The Premier League has not publicly entertained the idea of taking regular season games out of England, with CEO Richard Masters telling CNBC the league is "very different" from American peers when it comes to international games.

"In general, young people seek the social atmosphere because many of them just graduated college or are a few years out and are looking for similar social conveniences," Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, explained. Canary Wharf, London's privately owned financial district, which houses companies like JPMorgan, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, launched the Wharf Connect networking program in 2024 for professionals in the first 10 years of their career. "Part of the return-to-office push is that young people, especially, yearn for those connections, and relative to older generations, they are much more isolated and lonely, so return to office at least partially allows them to meet their coworkers," Schawbel said. Last week, I took a trip to Canary Wharf to attend a Xiao Long Bao (dumpling) masterclass at Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung — an event organized by Wharf Connect. Walking into a dining room nestled at the back of the restaurant where the workshop was taking place, I was stunned to see how busy it was with over 50 young professionals in attendance and chattering away.

Article: Jenny Southan, CEO of travel trend forecasting agency Globetrender, described the summer of 2025 as "a turning point for European tourism, underscoring that no destination is truly immune to climate volatility." Extreme heat is made much more likely by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels. Miguel Riopa | Afp | Getty Images Heatwaves and wildfires across popular vacation destinations in Spain, Portugal and Greece have taken their toll on local infrastructure in recent weeks, triggering mass evacuations and shuttering beaches. Alarmingly high temperatures have also been recorded in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, posing a direct challenge to the notion that northern Europe "offers guaranteed relief" in peak summer, Southan told CNBC by email. "This double blow has accelerated a behavioural shift already in motion: travellers are avoiding the most intense heat periods, favouring cooler coastal or alpine locations, moving trips to spring and autumn, and experimenting with higher-latitude destinations from the Baltics to the Scottish Highlands," Southan said. The ETC found that heightened concern about overcrowding had prompted tourists to spend their 2025 summer vacations in less popular or off-the-beaten track destinations, while interest in traditional hotspots has declined. "Our latest data shows that, even amid shifting economic and social realities, Europeans are not willing to compromise on travel, and they increasingly prefer quieter destinations and trips outside peak seasons," ETC President Miguel Sanz said in a statement.

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images Another one of the winners to emerge from the coolcations trend has been the small central European country of Slovenia, which has received growing interest in higher altitude, cooler destinations. Southern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively. Linda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. "Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand – Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites," Jonczyk told CNBC by email.
