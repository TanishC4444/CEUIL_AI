Article: Israel rejects international criticism of Gaza City takeover plan 16 hours ago Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save Reuters Benjamin Netanyahu's office says a newly adopted five-point plan is aimed "defeating Hamas" and "concluding the war" Israel has strongly rejected criticism from world leaders after its security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City. Israel's decision to expand its war in Gaza sparked condemnation from the UN and several countries including the UK, France and Canada, and prompted Germany to halt military exports to Israel. The plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet, lists five "principles" for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing "an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority". On Friday, foreign ministers from the UK, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Australia released a joint statement rejecting the plan, saying it would "aggravate" the already "catastrophic" situation in Gaza. In other reaction: UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move "wrong", saying it would "only bring more bloodshed" Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Israel "not to go down this path", saying it would "only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza" Turkey's foreign ministry urged the world community to prevent Israel's plan which aimed to "forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land" In China, a foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP news agency: "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory". Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins The IDF currently controls about three-quarters of Gaza, and almost all of its 2.1 million citizens are situated in the quarter of the territory that the military does not control.

Article: 'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests 53 minutes ago Share Save Tom Symonds Correspondent, BBC News Share Save Carl Court/Getty Images "We are not happy with these men in this hotel because we fear for our children," Orla Minihane tells me. "If that makes me far-right then so be it." Orla has lived near Epping since she was a child and describes herself as a "very boring woman who has worked in the City of London for 25 years". In the last month a series of protests, sometimes totalling several hundred people from both sides - and on one occasion up to 2,000 according to Essex Police - have taken place over the use of hotels for asylum seekers. The latest round of demonstrations began at the 80-room Bell in July, after a man living in the hotel was arrested, and subsequently charged, with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity. It's not a balanced culture." Orla Minihane is involved in the asylum hotel protests in Epping The protests have been promoted on social media under red, white and blue banner text with slogans such as "Protect Our Community", "Safety of Women and Children Before Foreigners" and "All Patriots Welcome". The activist group Stand Up To Racism sees this as far-right organisations "stirring up racist violence" and trying to repeat the violence that flared after the murders of three young girls in Southport. Outside The Bell, which is surrounded by steel fencing and guarded by a 24/7 security team, one of its residents, Wael, from Libya, is a year into his asylum claim and waiting for his fourth Home Office interview. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Anti-fascists gathered outside the Barbican Thistle Hotel in London last weekend to support the asylum seekers inside The police have largely kept control, sometimes facing criticism for their methods, including the false claim that Essex Police used buses to transport pro-migrant activists to a protest in Epping. "Everyone knows they are asylum seekers," Orla says, "Epping is very white." She adds of the hotel's occupants: "You know they are coming for freebies and when they come here they abuse the privilege. Successive governments have judged that paying for their accommodation and food is preferable to allowing them to compete with British workers in the jobs market, offering an incentive to come here. Asylum seekers recently arrived during the small hours at the wharf-side four-star Britannia International - 610 rooms, but, according to a former staff member, no longer the "luxury hotel" described in some reports. Jack Taylor/Getty Images Rival protesters outside the Britannia International hotel, in late July It can be very hard to establish basic facts about the young men in the hotels, the system that put them there, or the impact they might have on locals. While growing in number, asylum seekers who come by small boats across the English Channel are a small proportion of total immigration to the UK, and in 2024, just over a third of all asylum seekers. Madeleine Sumption from the Migration Observatory points out there is a problem publishing information about small groups of asylum seekers when it might identify them by age or sex, a long-standing approach for public bodies. "If they said there are 70 in the Bell Hotel, five are from Sudan, five from somewhere else, I think most people would feel better." Epping Forest District Council's Conservative Leader, Chris Whitbread recently said that "it is important to be transparent" about asylum hotel information. "It is clear that the Home Office still has a long way to go to build trust and confidence in its willingness to be open and honest about its intentions and performance," he wrote. On the other side of the political divide from the anti-migrant campaigners, in north London outside a meeting "to organise against the right wing", Sabby Dhalu from the protest group Stand Up To Racism wants the government to work more closely with councils so that their residents are better informed.

Article: Prince Andrew book seals his fate for any return 13 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save Getty Images Prince Andrew faces an unflattering portrait of his private life and finances This searing biography of Prince Andrew crackles with scandals about sex and money on almost every page, two subjects that have always caused problems for the royals. Getty Images Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein and Melania Trump [L] at Mar-a-Lago This account, more than 450 pages, is said to have taken four years to research, involving hundreds of interviews. This detail tallies with a piece in the New York Times this week that quotes a birthday greeting written by Allen to Epstein, which references "even royalty" being at one of Epstein's dinners. Getty Images Prince Andrew has stepped down as a working royal To rapidly lose some mid-life weight, when he was going out with a younger woman, the book records that Prince Andrew lived on a crash diet of "stewed prunes for breakfast, raw vegetables for lunch and soup for supper". Now in disgrace, Prince Andrew is claimed to spend his time, when not riding or golfing, cooped up watching aviation videos and reading thrillers, with The Talented Mr Ripley said to be his favourite. There are some more gentle anecdotes about him, such as when he was a helicopter pilot and ferried a group of soldiers from a rifle range and decided to put down on the Sandringham estate. Getty Images Prince Andrew was known as 'Baby Grumpling' as a baby But the biography is much more crowded with anecdotes about his rudeness and his acute lack of self awareness, not to mention a prodigious number of quick-fire affairs. "He's been afforded every type of privilege, all his life, while displaying very poor judgement and getting into highly compromising situations." Known as "Baby Grumpling" in his early years, Andrew was claimed to have moved people from jobs because one was wearing a nylon tie, and another because he had a mole on his face. There are details of his unhappy knack of getting involved with all the wrong people in his money-making ventures, from Libyan gun runners and relations of dictators to a Chinese spy. "The public will be wanting to see some clear action on the King's part I think - particularly as Andrew's connections to Epstein are raked over again," says Prof Maclaran. Getty Images Sarah Ferguson at a charity event in the south of France last month If this seems like a torrent of bad news, the book also raises some deeper questions about what lies behind Prince Andrew's character. He showed authentic courage when he flew helicopters in the Falklands war and he was remembered as being willing to "muck in" during that stressful time, when crews were living on canned food rather than fine dining. One of his former naval colleagues went from seeing Andrew as "immature, privileged, entitled" to having a more sympathetic view of a character of "loneliness and insecurity", a public figure who was uncertain about how he fitted in with other people, and had ended up with the "wrong sort of friends". Lownie's book offers meticulous detail of the connections between Prince Andrew and the US financier and sex offender, establishing links that went back to the early 1990s, earlier than had previously been established. It is also strong on the unbalanced nature of their relationship, with a friend of Andrew's describing the prince's dealings with Epstein as "like putting a rattlesnake in an aquarium with a mouse". Getty Images The famous photo of Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Epstein's sleazy and abusive world, with its mix of easy money and exploitative sex, was ultimately a form of blackmail operation, claims Lownie's book. And Lownie's sources cast doubt on whether Epstein did take his own life, questioning the medical evidence and the series of unfortunate gaps in supervision in the jail where he was being held. After his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview and the court case with Virginia Giuffre - which he settled with a rejection of any wrongdoing - Prince Andrew has been pushed out of public life, no longer a "working royal". "This isn't good for the monarchy," he says, even though "King Charles and Prince William have sought to limit the reputational damage Andrew can have on 'brand Windsor'," says Owens.

Article: Elon Musk's AI accused of making explicit AI Taylor Swift videos 13 hours ago Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones Technology reporter Share Save Getty Images Elon Musk's AI video generator has been accused of making "a deliberate choice" to create sexually explicit clips of Taylor Swift without prompting, says an expert in online abuse. According to a report by The Verge, Grok Imagine's new "spicy" mode "didn't hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos" of the pop star without being asked to make explicit content. She added: "It was shocking how fast I was just met with it - I in no way asked it to remove her clothing, all I did was select the 'spicy' option." Gizmodo reported similarly explicit results of famous women, though some searches also returned blurred videos or with a "video moderated" message. Under new UK laws which entered into force at the end of July, platforms which show explicit images must verify users' ages using methods which are "technically accurate, robust, reliable and fair". "We are aware of the increasing and fast-developing risk GenAI tools may pose in the online space, especially to children, and we are working to ensure platforms put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate these risks," it said in a statement. "It is essential that these models are not used in such a way that violates a woman's right to consent whether she be a celebrity or not," Lady Owen continued in a statement given to BBC News.

Article: Faith, family and fishing - the unlikely bond between JD Vance and David Lammy 13 hours ago Share Save Kate Whannel Political reporter Share Save PA Media JD Vance and David Lammy fishing together at Chevening in Kent US Vice President JD Vance is taking his holiday in the UK - a trip which will include visits to the Cotswolds, Scotland and, to kick it all off, a few days staying with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his grace-and-favour country home, Chevening House in Kent. "Our families enjoy each other's company very much, which always helps." Chevening is set in 3,000 acres of land, including a maze and lake, which was the first destination for the two families on Friday morning, for a spot of fishing. Strictly speaking, the 17th century manor house belongs to the nation, but cabinet ministers, particularly foreign secretaries, are allowed to use it for family getaways or meetings with foreign dignitaries. Getty Images Chevening House, the 17th century stately home made available to foreign secretaries, comes with a lake and maze Vance acknowledged the two men come from "different political spectrums" but said Lammy had been "kind enough to make time on a visit to [Washington] DC, we got to know each other a little bit then". Since that first meeting, when Lammy was in opposition and Vance had just been elected to the US Senate, they have met regularly including at the new Pope's inauguration in May. That is why Lammy - despite his natural affiliation with the Democratic Party in the US - was tasked with building bridges with their Republican opponents, even before the general election.

Article: 'Are we not working class enough?' Students divided on civil service internship reform 8 hours ago Share Save George Sandeman BBC News Share Save BBC Some students say they are being left out of a major civil service internship scheme after ministers announced reforms aimed at encouraging more working class people to work for the government. 'I was put off before but now I'll definitely apply' Adam Allen, 20, is from Newark-on-Trent and studies sociology and criminology at the University of Warwick The civil service was not something Adam was aware of until he went to university and attended some outreach events. "How was I going to stand a chance against everyone else that's had a bit more of a leg up and a bit more of an advantage than me, in terms of personal networks and knowledge?" Around 200 people are expected to be admitted to the revamped internship programme next year. Adam, who is part of social mobility organisation The 93% Club for state school students at British universities, says changes to the internship programme have prompted him to think again about the civil service. "It feels like I will now be taken seriously and no longer just someone [applying] without a real shot." 'Working class but not working class enough?' Nell Ashworth, 21, is from King's Lynn and studies social policy at the University of York As the daughter of a nurse, the virtues of public service were something Nell Ashworth grew up with. "I've done all of this preparation for, I suppose, not very much reward." Nell is all too aware that those who perform well during the summer internship, which typically takes place between the second and third year of a university course, can be fast-tracked into a graduate job in the civil service. Civil service interns must be working class, government says Labour must tell its working class story, says minister The criteria now being used for the internships are set out by the Social Mobility Commission, an independent body which advises the government. "If I'd have known then I could have changed my plans and applied for this summer's internship instead." State school-educated Nell, whose parents were the first in their families to go to university, says she understands why the government is trying to encourage more people with working class backgrounds into the civil service. And then that puts me off working in the civil service because now I have no idea who's looking out for me." 'It will make the civil service more representative' Hannah Begum, 20, is from Leeds and studies politics and international relations at the London School of Economics (LSE) Improving society is central to what Hannah Begum would like to do for a career. "A lot of them don't really know what it means to live in Leeds or live up north and how different it can be." Hannah thinks there are far more opportunities for high-quality work experience when you are based in London - never mind the savings on accommodation and travel costs - and that reforms to civil service internships will open doors for people like her. "We're not going to get those people in government if we don't create the stepping stones in order for them to enter." Hannah does understand why the reforms to internships are controversial for some, but she urges them to see things from her perspective. "It needs to be taken into account that not everyone has the same privileges in terms of being able to get a job in government… [the reforms] are not going to mean less intelligent people getting in, it just means a bit more of an equal chance." 'It feels like the country I love doesn't want me'

Article: UK sees rise in complaints over thin models in adverts 12 hours ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards • @edwardsclm Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images The banning of high street fashion adverts which featured models who looked "unhealthily thin" has led industry experts to warn of a return to the super skinny trend. The aesthetic characterised by models with hollow faces and protruding bones was seen in the 1990s and early 2000s but in more recent years been pushed aside to allow space for the body positive movement which embraced curves. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in 2025 it had received five or six of these complaints a week but in the two weeks after July's M&S ad ban it had more than 20. Getty Images Charli Howard is a model and body positivity activist Model and activist Charli Howard wrote a viral open letter after being dropped by her modelling agency for being "too big" despite being a UK size six to eight. A decade on she says: "I think we're on the cusp of seeing heroin chic return." The phrase heroin chic was used in the early 1990s, when some models were extremely thin, pale and had dark under eye circles reminiscent of drug use. In June, TikTok blocked search results for "skinnytok" - a hashtag which critics say directs people towards content which "idolises extreme thinness." "Some women are naturally thin, and that's absolutely fine. Next This Next advert was banned for portraying the model as "unhealthily thin" Zara, which had two adverts banned last week, said that both models had medical certification proving they were in good health. During her 20-year career she noticed "a brief moment of increased inclusivity" but was still turned down for jobs for "not being thin enough." "The body positivity movement raised awareness, but it didn't fully change the system. 'Many women are naturally very slim' Zara This Zara advert was recently banned by the UK advertising regulator Fashion journalist and consultant Victoria Moss does not think we are facing "heroin chic" but instead connects the trend to the rise of weight loss injections. "What's happening at the moment across broader culture is about thinness being held up as a moral health imperative, driven by the fervour over GLP-1 weight loss medication," she says. 'Body diversity is key' Simone Konu-Rae stylist and senior lecturer in fashion communication at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts, London says while it is important to "appreciate that the human body comes in a range of shapes and sizes", being thin is not necessarily back in fashion "it simply never went away". "The High Street is saying 'look, we have the same model as your favourite luxury brand, and our products look just as good at a fraction of the price'," she adds.

Article: Nasa Apollo missions: Stories of the last Moon men 14 hours ago Share Save Ben Fell BBC News Share Save NASA Who will be the next human to leave their footprint on the surface of the Moon? The loss of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, who guided the stricken mission safely back to Earth in 1970, means there are now just five people remaining who have escaped the relative safety of Earth orbit and ventured deeper into space. Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17 in 1972, last year but that date has slipped into 2026, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. The issues with Boeing's Starliner which left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station were embarrassing for the aerospace giant, while the "rapid unscheduled disassemblies" of SpaceX's Starship have become a customary sight to space watchers. NASA Apollo 13 was Jim Lovell's final mission Along with Frank Borman and Bill Anders, Jim Lovell made history when the three undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Watch: Moment Jim Lovell told earth "Houston, we've had a problem" as Apollo 13 suffered a fault Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11) NASA Buzz Aldrin, right, along with his crewmates Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, before their mission to the Moon On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement; many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: "I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew." Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." NASA Charlie Duke, along with Jim Lovell and Fred Haise in Mission Control, during the Apollo 11 mission In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: "Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again." "I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so," he later told the BBC. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17) NASA Harrison Schmitt was the first scientist to visit the Moon Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972.

Nasa said he had "turned a potential tragedy into a success" after an attempt to land on the Moon was aborted because of an explosion onboard the spacecraft while it was hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth. Tens of millions watched on television as Lovell and two other astronauts splashed back down into the Pacific Ocean, a moment which has become one of the most iconic in the history of space travel. He was truly one of a kind." Tom Hanks, who played Lovell in the 1995 movie Apollo 13, called the astronaut one of those people "who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own". Hanks said in a statement on Instagram that Lovell's many voyages "were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive". Getty Images The crew of the ill-fated Apollo 13: Jack Swigert, Jim Lovell and Fred Haise James Arthur Lovell Jr was born on 25 March 1928 - just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his historic trip across the Atlantic. 'Get the camera' The Saturn V rocket that shot Lovell, Borman and William Anders out of our atmosphere at 25,000mph (40,233km/h) was huge - three times larger than anything seen on the Gemini programme. "Please be advised," he said as the radio crackled back into life, "there is a Santa Claus." At that very moment, 239,000 miles away, a man in a blue Rolls-Royce pulled up outside Lovell's house in Houston. "Happy Christmas," said the card that came with it, "and love from the Man in the Moon."

Article: Beloved by bands and bank robbers, the Ford Transit turns 60 12 hours ago Share Save Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent Share Save BBC Theo Leggett at the wheel of the oldest Ford Transit still in existence Climbing into a 1965 Ford Transit is like stepping into a time capsule on wheels. "There are lots of iconic cars: the Morris Minor, the Mini, the Land Rover, the VW Beetle, but there's only one iconic van, and that's the Transit," says Edmund King, president of the AA. Erica Echenberg via Getty Images Punk band The Damned was one of the groups to use Ford Transits on tour, seen here in 1977 Originally a collaboration between Ford's engineers in the UK and Germany, and primarily aimed at the British and European markets, the Transit was designed to be as versatile as possible. Before you know it, I had 180 workers in 28 Transit vans driving around London." 'Britain's most wanted van' The Transit's speed and loading space also appealed to people on the wrong side of the law. In 1972, so the story goes, a Metropolitan Police spokesman claimed Transits were being used in 95% of bank raids, adding that its speed and loading space meant it had become the perfect getaway vehicle. Meanwhile the stereotype of the bullying "white van man", defined by Sunday Times reporter Jonathan Leake in 1997 as "a tattooed species, often with a cigarette in his mouth, who is prone to flashing his lights as he descends on his prey", did not specifically target Transit drivers. Bloomberg via Getty Images Ford Transit production moved to Turkey in 2013 Today, Ford continues to highlight both the Transit's British heritage and the work that still takes place here, especially at its UK headquarters in Dunton, Essex. But we also build our diesel engines in Dagenham, just down the road, and we make power packs for electric vans in Halewood, near Liverpool." Most of the company's European production remains in Turkey, and that looks unlikely to change.

Klaus Schmidt, the German archaeologist who led the site's first major excavations in the 1990s, called Gobekli Tepe "the world's oldest temple," theorizing that it brought together nomadic hunter-gatherers from across the Middle East. Conspiracy theories take root — with help from Joe Rogan Graham Hancock, a British journalist and star of the controversial Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse, has theorized — without empirical evidence — that Gobekli Tepe was built by a "lost civilization" wiped out by an Ice Age cataclysm. Once confined to the fringes, theories like Hancock's have gained mainstream traction — thanks in large part to Joe Rogan, whose massively popular podcast has become a platform for alternative takes on science and history. In November 2024, another Gobekli Tepe conspiracy theorist, Jimmy Corsetti, a YouTuber and self-described "ancient history investigator," appeared on Rogan's podcast, bringing with him a slew of speculations and wild theories about the site. toggle caption Rebecca Rosman for NPR "Some of these guys go to the site for half an hour and think they can explain the whole site," he says of the budding conspiracy theorists.

Article: After some delays and many adjustments, most of President Trump's tariffs kicked in this week, setting a 15% rate on most countries, though some others such as India could face much higher import taxes. The automaker said in July tariffs had already cost the carmaker about $1.1 billion in the previous quarter, but it opted to largely absorb those expenses and take a hit to profits. For example, the Budget Lab at Yale estimates that prices for clothing and textiles will be among those that see the biggest impact in the short term, with shoe prices potentially rising 39%. As noted, who pays the tariffs will likely be split, so a 15% tariff on the European Union, for example, doesn't necessarily mean that you'll pay 15% more for Italian olive oil. Sponsor Message The Budget Lab at Yale estimates the average cost from tariffs for households will be $2,400 this year, but it's an estimate based only on what's known about tariffs so far. Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Federal Reserve president, this week recalled how former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan used to say he knew when the central bank was successful in battling inflation: People wouldn't even be thinking about it.

Article: Mark Schiefelbein/AP/AP President Trump said his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine is set to happen "very shortly" at a date and location that Trump said he would announce "a little bit later" on Friday. In response to the need for a permanent international court addressing crimes committed during war, the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, officially began operating in July 2002. The court doesn't have its own police force or enforcement body, so it relies on countries' cooperation to make arrests, transfer arrested people to ICC detention in The Hague and to enforce sentences. The court also issued warrants for Yoav Gallant, Israel's former defense minister, Muhammad Deif, Hamas' military chief whom Israel says it killed in August, as well as other Hamas officials. At the time, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told NPR, "There is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable. We support accountability for perpetrators of war crimes." Sponsor Message Khrushcheva said, "So for Putin, it's yet another confirmation for him that the West is fairly hypocritical, and so he doesn't pay attention to it." Back in September, Putin traveled to Mongolia, an ICC member since 2002. The view of the court is that, as a member state, Mongolia had an obligation to honor the ICC's arrest warrant, according to David Bosco, professor at Indiana University, who spoke to NPR's All Things Considered last year. While experts and analysts have long said the prospect of an arrest of Putin is extremely slim, it's unlikely that the Russian leader would take the chance and hold such a significant meeting on unfriendly ground, Khrushcheva said.

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020. Key false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said. “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.” Broadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs Lou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.” “Yes. Key false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said. Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’” Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion. Broadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani Statements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Key false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.

Key false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said. Key false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said. “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said. “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Article: CNN — Jamie Foxx remains hospitalized in Georgia nearly a week after his daughter revealed the actor experienced a “medical complication,” a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN on Monday. She added in her post that due to “quick action and great care,” her father is “on his way to recovery.” CNN reported Friday that Foxx was hospitalized and undergoing medical tests.

Article: CNN — A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family. Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

Article: The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

Article: CNN — Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine. In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion. CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022. Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.” “There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.” He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.” But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.” “They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.” Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable. In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Article: Senate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly. Democrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success. Feinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.” She recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.” Cardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein. The Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns. Democrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor. Asked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.” “Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol. Feinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary. But Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.” Asked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Article: CNN — The governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists. The recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported. In the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.” Jennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News. “For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement. The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.” “Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered.

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age. Children ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane. For everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.

A massive winter storm started the service problems during the holiday season, but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights. Part of what created worse problems at Southwest than at other airlines is that crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify it electronically, to let them it of their availability.

That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.” The 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team. “He’s here.” Hamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.” The safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL. I want to stand for that.” Beane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player “is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.” “(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added. “We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.” According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.

Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had “a lot of problems with the video.” But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.” Gilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary. “We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.” Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.” Last month, Republican Rep. Mills said, “We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I’m sure are quaking in their boots over this.” In response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.

Article: CNN — The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer, according to a new court filing. The district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.” It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.” No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.

Article: For the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify. Although Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace. Cars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.” Deserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971. Add to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution. David Boe/AP “Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.” Sherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail. Scott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division “We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.” Only Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments. “It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.” Alstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states. Incoming high-speed lines In March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor. The 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027. Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: “As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America’s most skilled workers to get there.” Brightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada. Coupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes. Costing $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion. With California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt. “The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours. “When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.” According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions. Rail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%. The enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.

Article: After the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, Ketch wrote an Op-ed in The New York Times calling for country music stars to let go of the fear of retaliation from their fanbase, and to break their silence on the gun debate. Audie talks with Ketch about what it’s like to be a musician and a parent in Nashville right now and what he thinks country musicians can do to help prevent another mass shooting. So when First Lady Jill Biden visited the city to attend a vigil for the shooting victims of the Covenant School, it was an absolute given that a country music artist would be there. When a country singer gets off the road, chances are at 8:00 in the morning on Monday after the big weekend, that guy or gal is in line dropping their kid off at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. Audie Cornish 00:03:14 So getting an emoji like that or getting the obligatory "are you okay" that we all start to send each other now when there's a shooting, especially at a school, you're saying it it hits you in a place of what? Audie Cornish 00:06:59 I guess I want to start maybe with Wagon Wheel, because if people go to look you up, that might be the first song they learn about. I wrote it when I was about 17, going to school up in New England in a prep school called Exeter, and I was had just learned to play the banjo up there. Hey mama rock me Audie Cornish 00:07:46 You talk about the idea that your best known song, Wagon Wheel, is often blasting out of a truck, so to speak, that has an NRA sticker. Ketch Secor 00:08:05 When you make the kind of music that I make with a fiddle and a banjo and harmony singing and a particular style of songwriting, you're engaging in a community that might be different than your own sort of background, and it's not. Audie Cornish 00:08:50 And when you're around Nashville and you have political conversations, wherever the person falls on the spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this is The South. And whether it's supposed to be that way or, you know, I think we're in a state of considerable growth down south, but the vestiges remain, and they're important to talk about in this regard, because one of the vestiges is gun culture, and it's largely considered like the rebel flag in the past, just something that exists here. Ketch Secor 00:11:15 Well, I didn't know to go into this, but but I'm excited that we are, Audie, because, you know, country music really especially, and to clarify, contemporary country music on the radio is a real safe space for us to not talk about political divisiveness and not talk about things of of substance. So this sort of, you know, hallmark kind of these ideals that are tossed around might not be that realistic for today's reality of, you know, I worked I'm part of a global economy working two jobs. Instead, they are allowed to say, I taught my child how to, you know, I mean, when I was a kid in the eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned how to fire a weapon. So this is my way of saying it's not over and it won't be over until those deaths, those three deaths of American children gunned down in the third grade, until they mean something, that's when it'll be over. If in all these states and it's not just Tennessee, you've got these blue cities, these little blue dots in a sea of red, and by red I mean very conservative, very pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment legislatures. And and when Nashville in the early 1960s, in the late 1950s said its first foot forward, this was the proving ground, other parts of the South were too unsafe. You know, 50 years from now I think we're going to be looking back at these couple of years as the deciding time for a assault weapons ban in the United States. Audie Cornish 00:18:59 Again, I want to bring it to the question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones who given what we know about the music, number one, have been socially punished for activism by what we call Music Row, by music radio, by country music radio in particular, which still has a very kind of strong grip in a way programmers do, and even recent history. Ketch Secor 00:20:20 Hey, I'm just reaching out to all my Nashville music community in the wake of the shooting and sharing this story that I wrote that came out today in The Times. And when you look at the the roster, who's on the marquee, it's not the usual Americana folks who always say, you know, we stand with kids, we stand up against gun violence. Ketch Secor 00:22:34 There's nothing but up here because we we have started at the very baseline where music coming out of Nashville on the radio says nothing about violence against children in our schools or about the need to rethink the types of weaponry that is associated with the Second Amendment. You know, generally, just like I'm in a songwriting mood here, I'm in a a moment in time with a lot of different opportunities as a writer to engage on this, whether it's, you know, writing the right caption for a photograph on Instagram or writing an op ed piece for The New York Times or being on this podcast with you, Audie. There's so many ways to choose my words right now and try and have them be resonant for the pain that we're feeling in Nashville, Tennessee and around the country because we are just so tired, parents, that our kids are not safe in their schools. What that means for me as a songwriter is that I also have the chance to write new music about this and to put my money where my mouth is.

Article: (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.) Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic. For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Either way, here are some key things to know: Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Interest on your savings Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains) Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle Unemployment income Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account Tips Gambling winnings Income from a rental property you own Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received. “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions. Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million. Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more.

Article: Why some undocumented immigrants choose to pay taxes The National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including: • It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws. • Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform. How some pay taxes despite not having Social Security numbers Critics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.” Some noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method. Immigrant rights advocates are speaking out on social media In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue. “Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time. Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist who’s turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter.

Article: CNN — Tuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz Tax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that: Tax all types of income the same for high earners Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income. Tax wealth or unrealized capital gains We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable.

If you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.” While the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle.

Eldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to “separate competitions for AI-generated images.” Eldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a “cheeky monkey” in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images. They are not.” ‘Not about winning’ Eldagsen told CNN Tuesday: “It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don’t need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.” He said that AI had left many photographers feeling “threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.” Eldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation. “I was just making a test to see if they were aware – like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.” In further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement. ‘Misleading’ claims The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition’s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the “co-creation” of this image using AI. “As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.” The statement said organizers recognize “the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.” “While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,” the World Photography Organisation added.

Article: Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.” "Elder Sex" is Marilyn Minter's full set of images originally shot for a New York Times Magazine story on senior sex and intimacy. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy Marilyn Minter & LGDR A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors’ sex lives. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work. Seeking partners In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.” In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged. I’m not going to fake anything here.’” Changing attitudes Minter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said. Video Ad Feedback Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 - Source: CNN Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 But the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Though “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR She hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.

Article: New York CNN — Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure. Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them. Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.

In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations — a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald’s customers. “We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,” thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald’s (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call.

Article: CNN — Shares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 3% in early trading Monday after a report sparked concerns that its core search engine could lose market share to AI-powered rivals, including Microsoft’s Bing. Last month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Google’s search engine, prompting a “panic” inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.) In an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. In a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to “improve the quality of our results” and “offer entirely new ways to search,” including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words. “Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.” Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge. At an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring “the magic of generative AI” directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.” Microsoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Microsoft’s Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to “be responsible in each step along the way” as they build and release AI tools. For Google, he said, that means allowing time for “user feedback” and making sure the company “can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.” He also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.

Article: The best bidets we tested Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Finding the best bidet for your home can make a world of difference. Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Attachment Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored If you’re looking for a low-cost bidet that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is the bidet for you. Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushy’s compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of toilets here. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While I love the Tushy attachment, there’s one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa — and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested — wasn’t effective. Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience. Beyond being effective, the Toto’s stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or you’re worried a bidet with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more. Even though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you don’t have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored The Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isn’t much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Tushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features — a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water — for $359. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. Plus, since the Cloud doesn’t have a tank, it doesn’t look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water. The Cloud’s side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesn’t have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use. However, the round version of that bidet can feel a little small, so if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, our old value pick, the Alpha JX2, is probably the best bidet for you. How we tested I’ve conducted multiple rounds of testing and have formally tested 31 bidets over a period of nearly four years to find the best ones on the market. Performance General experience: I noted my overall impressions while using each bidet and what traits stood out the most, whether it was the comfort of the stream, simplicity of controls, ease of setup, etc. Aim/directional spray: I noted how good the aim of each bidet’s spray was and the overall range if it was adjustable and counted how many positions each bidet’s spray had. Number of key features: I counted the number of key features, which were whether the bidet had warm water, whether it had a dryer and whether it had a remote. Think of the Tushy Classic 3.0: You’re not replacing your seat, just putting a thin attachment underneath it (Tushy released two attachments, the Wave and Oasis, which actually replace your seat like an electric bidet. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments don’t have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didn’t get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Electric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, the Tushy Cloud and one of our previous picks the Alpha JX2, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy. So if you have a one-piece toilet you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidet’s requirements. While it’s a nice upgrade from the Classic, this bidet is missing the ability to adjust the stream’s position — a basic feature I was shocked wasn’t included — and it’s quite pricey. Other bidet seats we tested Alpha Bidet Alpha JX2 Bidet Seat Alpha Bidet This Alpha bidet seat was our previous best value bidet but was dethroned by the Tushy Cloud. Toto Washlet C5 Bidet Seat Toto If you want the remote and user presets of the K300 but don't need the endless warm water, the Toto C5 is the bidet for you. $469 $391 at Amazon This bidet is a slight upgrade from our runner-up bidet seat, the Toto Washlet C2, adding a remote control and the ability to set two user presets. The remote is oriented horizontally, so it isn’t as easy to use with one hand as some other remotes I tried, and the arm of the Cloud has lights so you can see which setting you’re on, which the remote of the Cloud+ does not. The flashiest feature of the Aura is its auto-open lid, which could be useful in a larger bathroom, but whenever I’d walk into mine the sensor would detect movement and it would open. Nova Bidet Eco Nova Bidet Seat Nova Bidet This bidet only comes in elongated versions and wasn't as comfortable to use as other bidets we tested, especially when it came to its dryer. Toto Washlet A2 Elongated Bidet Seat Toto If all you want is a comfortable stream, this Toto bidet is an okay pick, but I think the warm air dryer of the C2 is worth the extra money. $272 $245 at Amazon The most budget-friendly of Toto’s Washlet Bidet Series, the A2 includes many of the great features as the C2 — warm water, dual action spray with oscillator, adjustable water temp and volume settings, heated seat with temperature control and that convenient arm control panel we love. It’s high on comfort and ease of use, but for less than $100 more, the C2 provides warm air drying with three temperature settings, automatic deodorizer, technology that auto-cleans the wand and it also comes in round-front bowl styles. Prime Day Deal Bio Bidet BB-550 Bidet Seat Bio Bidet If you don't want to commit to spending as much for a bidet seat, this is another solid option, but it isn't as feature-filled as the C2. Easy to install once we traded out the toilet supply line hose for a longer, more flexible $10 piece from the hardware store, we like that it comes loaded with features including warm water, an adjustable heated seat, a seat sensor to keep any accidental sprays from happening, a warm air dryer, adjustable water pressure and even a night light. But the controls are located on the sides of the seat, which makes them much less intuitive to use than the Toto Washlet C2 and the Toto’s stream and dryer also prove to be more comfortable. Its spray wasn’t quite as good as Toto’s, and its dryer didn’t cover the wide area that Toto’s did, but it was comfortable, and in general, I enjoyed using this bidet. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but I think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX2 do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was my favorite stream pattern out of all the bidets I tested. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200; however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway bidets. Editor’s Note: We previously tested the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat, the Alpha Bidet JX and the Coway Bidetmega 200 Electric Bidet Seat, but they have since been discontinued and removed from this article.

Article: The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as with Harvard University. READ MORE: Funding freeze could set research back years, Harvard scientists say The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.” This would not be the university’s first settlement over the 2024 protests. Last month, UCLA reached a $6 million settlement with three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who sued, arguing that the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024. The University of California, one of the nation’s largest public university systems, has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests and has said it is committed to campus safety and inclusivity and will continue to implement recommendations. WATCH: A look at ‘Project Esther’ and Trump’s approach to combat antisemitism on campus As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university’s Jewish community. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

Article: “We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” RAED MORE: ‘Houston, we’ve had a problem’: Remembering Apollo 13 at 50 One of NASA’s most traveled astronauts in the agency’s first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth’s orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew’s Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ”Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.” A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I’m still breathing.’ So, I don’t worry about crises.” And the mission’s retelling in the popular 1995 movie “Apollo 13” brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame — thanks in part to Lovell’s movie persona reporting “Houston, we have a problem,” a phrase he didn’t exactly utter. I measure risk.’” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not,” he remarked. “I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program,” Gene Kranz, NASA’s legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks’ portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell’s last mission — immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell — that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. READ MORE: Apollo 13’s most famous quotes originated in Hollywood That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn’t have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA’s historian. In Hanks’ version, it became “Houston, we have a problem.” What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA’s finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong’s and Buzz Aldrin’s walks on the moon nine months earlier. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon “is my one regret,” Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, “The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction.” And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote “Lost Moon,” the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film “Apollo 13.” In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: Equipped with her own tailored bee suit and a hood to cover her floppy ears, Maple — a former police dog — has an important retirement task: helping save thousands of honeybee hives. American foulbrood only becomes detectable to humans by smell when it reaches severe infection, at which point the colony risks death, said Meghan Milbrath, a researcher and assistant professor of entomology at Michigan State University. (Video: Michigan State University) “She basically just turns all of that effort into a few minutes of her running around sniffing,” Milbrath said of the 9-year-old dog, who works at MSU’s Pollinator Performance Center. It’s part of a larger bee conservation effort in a record-breaking year for colony death in the United States, according to a survey by Apiary Inspectors of America, Auburn University and Oregon State University. The colony losses, estimated at 56 percent in the year beginning in April 2024, result in an “increasing challenge to meeting the demand for crop pollination and honey production in the U.S.,” the survey said. Maple follows the paw prints of other “bee dogs” across the country that have delved into conservation — including Darwin, a German shorthaired pointer in North Carolina; Mack, a retired Labrador retriever from Maryland; and Mack’s successor, Tukka, a springer spaniel. Stejskal said Maple took a misstep and got injured while they were working on a cold case in Canada, forcing her to step away in April 2024 after seven years as a human-remains detection dog.

Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “People pay their taxes and rightfully have an expectation that certain services are going to be delivered,” Walsh said of the cuts that went into effect July 1. “The current budget threatens our ability to deliver those services in a way that I believe our constituents deserve … People are going to feel it.” The $16 million drop in spending in one of New York’s largest cities mirrors budget woes playing out around the country as fears of economic uncertainty build. From big cities such as Los Angeles and Houston to smaller ones including Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Yakima, Washington, leaders nationwide are curtailing services or raising taxes to try to cover budget shortfalls. Advertisement Those programs, which pumped tens of billions of dollars into cities during the coronavirus pandemic, are winding down around the same time the Trump administration plans to slash some federal funding over political disputes about immigration, environmental and diversity policies.

Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Walsh, an Independent, sought to balance the city’s $330 million budget with a 2 percent increase in property taxes and the withdrawal of $27 million from Syracuse’s emergency “rainy day” fund. “My approach has been to try to control our destiny as much as we can through the services we provided.” But the city’s 10-member Common Council, all Democrats, opposed Walsh’s plan. Advertisement “We are dealing with macrolevel uncertainty that filters down to the state level, the local level, and then down to the household level,” said Corey Williams, the chairman of the Common Council finance committee. “We are trying to minimize the uncertainty at the household level.” Advertisement Advertisement The council also rejected Walsh’s request to dip into reserve funds, fearing a bigger financial crisis could be looming. “I personally did not feel it was pouring at the moment — it was drizzling with a storm on the horizon.” Despite Walsh vetoing the budget cuts, the council overrode him in May. Walsh said he was merely trying to be “honest and transparent with my constituents.” Advertisement His list contained nearly a dozen ways the Syracuse Police Department would be affected by a $3.5 million cut, including slashing overtime. The spending cuts including the elimination of funds for the city’s network of ShotSpotter cameras that detect gunfire, which will make it harder for officers to curb gun violence and help victims, Cecile said. It’s also cutting funding for two housing inspectors, which Walsh’s statement said “negatively impacts the ability of the city to help ensure safe, quality housing.” Advertisement Syracuse is a city where a large concentrations of properties that have fallen into disrepair and it has one of the highest rates of childhood lead poisoning in the country. “And if you can’t enforce compliance, in terms of getting a housing inspector out to a property, that leaves children and all inhabitants of that home in danger.” Williams and Monto, the council members, said the budget they passed merely included broad spending targets.

Article: Lovell Jr., the American astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 spacecraft on its lunar voyage in 1970 and shepherded it on a perilous four-day journey back to Earth after an oxygen tank exploded, an ordeal that transfixed the world, died Aug. The legacy of Apollo 13 was more complicated — a terrifying episode that spoke to the skill and levelheadedness of the crew trying to stabilize their spacecraft and Mission Control managers back in Houston. Lovell had participated in three earlier missions, notably on the 1968 voyage aboard the Apollo 8 mission — the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the moon and return safely to Earth. Advertisement Apollo 13, which took off on April 11, 1970, was meant to be NASA’s third lunar landing, a mission that entailed visiting a new landing site and retrieving rock samples. “That’s when the ol’ lead weight went down to the bottom of my stomach,” he once told an interviewer, “and I thought that we were really in deep trouble.” That unease prompted one of the most harrowing moments in spaceflight history, and surely one of its greatest understatements. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With plans for the lunar landing quickly abandoned, NASA directed the crew to switch off the ship’s damaged service module and turn the lunar lander, which had its own air supply, into a jury-rigged lifeboat. The three men crowded into a spacecraft meant to carry two and settled in for a 90-hour flight — twice as long as the Aquarius Lunar Module was built to operate. Even with barely enough resources to ration their way through a slingshot around the moon and a journey home, there was the problem of trajectory: The ship was now on course to miss Earth by thousands of miles. Using only the Earth in the window as an indication of their position — the computer systems had all been turned off to conserve the ship’s scant electricity for reentry — Mr. Advertisement The task was made onerous by the ship’s newfound center of gravity: Aquarius was only meant to be piloted once it had disconnected from the bulky command and service modules. (One of the heroes of that project, NASA engineer Ed Smylie, died in April at 95.) Advertisement Advertisement Then the crew endured four days of dehydration, sleep deprivation and near-freezing temperatures so demoralizing that they ripped the heart rate sensors from their bodies in defiance of NASA’s medical team. “He said, ‘My feeling was that it was like playing a game of solitaire,’” said science and technology journalist Jeffrey Kluger, who co-wrote “Lost Moon” (1994) and became an editor at Time magazine. Then there was the question of the heat shield: Mission Control couldn’t be sure what shape it was in after the explosion, leaving the possibility of a tragic disintegration during the final leg of Apollo 13’s journey. He told friends that returning to family life put his orbital exploits into perspective: When he got home, he still had a mortgage to pay and kids to put through college. Lovell’s legacy in the public’s mind may have been defined by his actions aboard Apollo 13, but he frequently said that he considered Apollo 8, where he helped pilot the first crewed mission to orbit the moon, to be the highlight of his NASA career. Advertisement Advertisement Apollo 8 was originally envisioned as an orbital trip around the Earth, but rumors that Soviets were preparing for a moon orbit prompted NASA to retool the mission. In a decisive moment, he helped spot a scene that would become the iconic photograph known as “Earthrise,” documenting the moment they became the first humans to see Earth peek into view over the moon’s barren surface.

Article: The Queens shelter, called Ace’s Place, which officially opened this week, will be fully funded by the city at a cost of nearly $66 million over the next five years, according to Neha Sharma, a spokesperson for the city’s social services department. The shelter’s creation comes as the Trump administration and some state governments are attempting to roll back rights for transgender people, including curtailing access to gender-affirming health care, participation in high school sports and service in the military. “It’s a site that has been in the works for quite a while but it really is meaningful in this moment in time when the rights of the LGBT community as a whole, but particularly trans individuals, are under attack,” she said. “I feel like the city had our back,” said Coleman, who said that as an organizer of Bronx Pride he saw corporations pull back from sponsorships amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. So I was incredibly happy to learn that they were 100 percent behind making sure that we got the project up and running.” Advertisement Studies show that transgender people disproportionately experience homelessness. In 2020, researchers at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that eight percent of transgender adults reported indicators of recent homelessness — compared to one percent of straight cisgender adults. Jawanza Williams, the director of movement building at VOCAL-NY, a group that advocates for people impacted by homelessness, celebrated the new facility as a win for those who feel “unsafe in shelter systems that aren’t accounting for the unique needs and experiences of trans people.” Advertisement The shelter will provide a chance for trans people who are homeless to be surrounded by other people who share similar experiences, which can be “nurturing and important for people’s well-being,” said Stephen Russell, a researcher at Arizona State University who has studied homelessness among LGBTQ+ Americans. That feeling of safety, Russell said, can in turn provide the context for homeless transgender people “to make their way to stable housing.” Advertisement Advertisement Coleman said that his goal for Ace’s Place — named after his late mother, who struggled with drug addiction and to whom his grandmother would always open her home — is “economic empowerment.” Services at the shelter will include culinary classes, an on-site psychiatrist, job placement services and a housing specialist who will help those staying at the facility secure more permanent housing, Coleman said. “If you want to address homelessness, you have to have services that target the communities who are homeless,” said Christine Quinn, a former New York City council speaker and the CEO of Win, the largest provider of shelter and supportive housing for the city’s homeless families. Advertisement The shelter comes after the city agreed, as part of a lawsuit settlement in 2021, to reserve a minimum of 30 shelter beds for transgender and gender nonconforming clients across the city’s shelters. “Despite a presidential administration focused on taking America backwards and making homelessness worse, states can and must focus on real solutions to homelessness, like housing and support,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center, an advocacy group that has tracked a spike in what it calls “anti-homeless” local ordinances around the country in the past year.

It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources,” Eskamani said in a statement. “Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts.” Advertisement Conservation groups sued the state and the federal government on June 27, four days after Florida began setting up what DeSantis called “a makeshift” detention center next to Everglades National Park and within Big Cypress National Preserve. Advertisement It is unclear when that will be, though, with the state at the forefront of assisting the Department of Homeland Security in detaining immigrants and DeSantis planning to open at least one more facility in north Florida. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday’s ruling “is another attempt to prevent the president from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations.” Noem said similar detention centers might be built in other states.

That has opened up a black market for obtaining Israeli shekels, the predominant currency, with Palestinians forced to pay exorbitant rates to gain access to their money to feed themselves and their families. At the same time, there has been a huge surge in the price of basic goods since the start of the war, especially in the face of Israeli restrictions on the entry of food into the territory. A 55-pound sack of flour is around $180, two pounds of sugar is about $10, and a similar amount of tomatoes about $20, according to surveys carried out this week by the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce in three cities.

On this idea of working with both parties, The Forward, which is a progressive Jewish outlet, reported a few months ago that in a speech to Republican attorneys general this summer, you said that student activists were “frothing at the mouth, looking like they just came out of Mosul.” You said that there is a “convergence of what I call the radical left and, like, Islamist groups here in the U.S.” And you praised the Trump administration’s punishing of universities like Harvard and others, saying, “God bless Secretary McMahon,” referring to the secretary of education. 1, I certainly was talking about activists, but only those who are completely masked, who don’t show their identity, who are dressed like other people we’ve seen unfortunately on the field of battle, and those student activists who are screaming and harassing and threatening other students. And then I give credit to the Trump administration for actually implementing aspects of the plan and taking a strong view, again, in the face of real, not imagined, real acts of hate, real acts of discrimination. Maybe I went a little overboard saying “God bless.” And at the same time, when I met with Secretary McMahon, I met with her in her office and told her, “Yes, I appreciate what you’re doing on these universities leaning in, and I’m worried about overreach, because going too far could not only harm the universities, it harms our whole country.” And the fact of the matter is, pulling back funding for research can have lots of deleterious impacts. So I said to her and to the antisemitism task force, “Yes, lean in, but don’t go too far.” What would be a sign that this administration has overcorrected, in your view?

Article: Just the past couple of weeks, we’ve seen the White House Fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency responsible for providing unbiased info on the labor market, because the president was displeased with the jobs report. But I think it’s worth remembering — or this is, I guess, my view — that him going after district redistricting in the country, him being obsessed with tariffs, those I think in his mind, aren’t related to each other. And he doesn’t want to lose control of the House next year, knowing that losing control of the House not only puts an end to his legislative agenda such that it exists, but exposes him to political vulnerability. And so far, of course, the Senate has gone along with him in virtually every respect, and he feels there are no guardrails and he can just do what he wants. But I also think that one of the things that he’s worked on since he got into office, even before, is undermining all other sources of authority, not just in terms of what kind of power they have, but also how people view them. He wants everybody to distrust the Department of Justice or the courts or certainly the media, because he wants them to be viewed as illegitimate, which just makes him the only source that his people look to. And I do think that this kind of falls into the category of if you can make everything look super partisan and super sketchy, that’s just in service of his greater power grab. This is a process that has gone on this for 100 years, in which two different sets of surveys are done, compiled by career members of the BLS and then released to the public. In 2012, Jack Welch, well lauded CEO of General Electric, claimed that in the run up to Obama’s re-election, the BLS had manipulated the unemployment number to show it going below 8 percent and he didn’t believe it had gone below 8 percent So the BLS has had these kinds of attacks before, but this is certainly one of the most remarkable things I’ve ever seen, where the president literally just woke up and fired the head of the BLS and claimed all the numbers were made up, which, as I just said, not a single economist. Steve mentioned earlier that the president seems to have this belief that he can of fire anyone in the executive branch and the entire federal bureaucracy and replace him with whomever he deems appropriate, kind of irrespective of what Congress has said. And part of the argument for this is that it enhances political accountability, the president being democratically accountable to the American people, giving him this kind of broader, almost unlimited removal power, and thus enhances the accountability of executive branch officials for the American people. And I’ll make one last point about this, which is historically, and I’m not here to tell you, I know for sure that this time will be the same or different. Well, that’s what I was going to ask you both, is that this move by Trump spotlights his panic about what’s happening, certainly how it will impact his party’s fortunes and whether he keeps a death grip on the government going forward. I mean, do you think that the tariffs and what we’ve got coming and the softening job numbers are the beginning of what Trump has been worried about or at least what his party has been worried about in terms of people actually being able to see what’s going on. If it turns out that under Trump there is a significant economic slowdown, if there is a recession, even I think that is a moment where the bottom can really fall out from under his administration and his political standing. But I do think that that’s a real danger for him, that in the absence of any other compelling thing outside of his particular cult of personality, to keep him buoyed up with the rest of the public, he just doesn’t have that much. quite negative, I think honestly, I would say on behalf of all of us who are journalists or opinion people or commentators on the situation, I think we’ve actually done a pretty good job of explaining to the American people what’s really going on in the Trump administration and what’s not going on, and I think that’s part of why he panics and does something like the BLS, but when you see polling data on that, I think you’re going to find that even that has backfired on him, and people are simply not going to believe that the data is manipulated or that he did the right thing in firing the head of the BLS. O.K, so the topic of political danger is a perfect segue into the second part of this, which is I have been following the Texas redistricting drama for weeks, since well before the new congressional maps were posted. So this week’s Hot new development is that Republicans have drafted the FBI to help them track down and arrest Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state in an effort to bog down this power grab. In response, Democrats I’ve been talking to including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, understand that they cannot take the so-called high road any longer, but are going to need to dig in and punch back hard. So my thought watching all of this, and I believe my suggestions way back when, was just that Congress should pass a bill ending partisan gerrymandering, which is well within Congress’s power to do. I think that the country should move away from single member districts, which necessitate gerrymandering, and move towards multi-member districts, which could open the door to more viable third parties in the American system. So in Texas, if they’re going to squeeze out five more Republican leaning congressional districts, this necessarily means spreading Democratic voters across other already Republican leaning districts, and these new districts may be only modestly or slightly Republican leaning, and prior districts from which you’re moving. And so part of what’s funny to me about all of this is that it’s clear that Donald Trump has a vision of what gerrymandering is, which is just that it’s a generic way to get more seats and there’s no cost to it. The other thing I’ll say here, just in terms of fighting fire with fire, whatever cliche you want to use is that there aren’t that many high population Republican states. And so if you do get into this game of tit for tat, you might end up in a situation where in fact, what you’ve done is made the map lean a little more Democratic than it otherwise would have been. If you stand down, if you elect us into a majority, we will pass a bill outlawing partisan gerrymandering, which in addition to I think being smart politics is just the right thing to do. But, I mean, the people in Texas, if you talk to them, are like, we can’t afford to just stand down at this point because they have taken this fight national and Republicans have no concerns about blowing through good government guardrails or anything like this. If you believe the latter, then I can understand the hesitation about wanting to abandon nonpartisan redistricting commissions and that kind of thing, because it feels like a retreat from ideals of fairness and good government. Then I think it leads you, inevitably to the conclusion that those people who are interested in actually fair elections have to do what it takes now to win the power to pass laws to ensure fair elections. And then hopefully, as Jamelle said, if we Democrats and I’m a Democrat can get back in power and can pass some laws to bring this to a better place, then that is the most optimistic scenario I can see. To build on that, I think that the best case scenario does involve Democrats nationally recognizing that the only way past this moment in our politics, past Trumpism, you might say, is through serious political reform. So I want to jump on that because I actually spent some time down in Austin, and I’ve talked to a lot of the Democrats who’ve been watching this thing down there for a long time. The people were lining up and in the Capitol to testify and the other arenas where they were having these things, people were lining up online to testify they had overflow rooms. Well, I mean, you got to I think it’s worth saying that public opinion is in a kind of dialectical relationship with actual politicians and that the baseline state of public opinion is they don’t like gerrymandering, but it may not be the most salient thing. And I think that if Democrats say to themselves, Oh, well, I don’t know if we can mobilize voters to care about this, I think they’re just not they’re not trying hard enough. And I would have to say the Democrats don’t come to this with absolutely clean hands, because back in 2022, they redistricted in the state of New York and the courts threw it out, claimed it was too partisan, and the court drew the boundaries for that election. So I think the American public finds all of this really complicated, confusing, and has a hard time figuring out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. So like Jamelle, I think this could be, once they get through this immediate response and how to deal with Texas specifically, it would be nice if this could go back on the table as a nationwide issue of reform. I would have never predicted that some of the nominees, some of the manifestly unqualified nominees that he put forward, Pete Hegseth, just to pick a name, would have gotten confirmed by the Senate. If the Republicans are willing to sit back and allow him to fire the head of the BLS, allow him, ironically, to weaponize the Justice Department after attacking Biden for so-called weaponizing the Justice Department, then I’m not sure what short of one of those two things I mentioned, is going to cause the Republicans to push back in any kind of major way. It would be surprising if it was a midterm Wipeout, but even if it were a midterm Wipeout, I think we’re in this weird zone where Republican lawmakers are not just politically afraid of upsetting Trump, but they are physically afraid for their safety. Which kind of brings me to where I want to wrap this up, which is that he is a lame duck president, as you point out, unless he totally blows up the Constitution, he’ll be gone in another few years. And if you buy that there’s such a thing as a moral ecology to a society, then Trump has influenced the moral ecology of American politics in such a way as to make the kind of open and explicit corruption and casual and open bigotry, all these things to make them common again in American political life. And so I love this view that there will be tangible policy things from the Trump era that may not last beyond Trump, that may not last beyond the personnel associated with them. But I started my career, as I said at the times Washington Bureau in June of 1974, and of course, in August of 1974, Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford got on television and said, we are a nation of laws and not of men. It’s possible that whatever’s left of the moderate wing of the Republican Party, and I will absolutely grant you that he’s driven most of them out of power and out of office, will reassert itself.

Article: Monochronic people “tend to live by the clock and are primed, at least during work hours, to prioritize obligations over relationships.” Polychronic people, on the other hand, “tend to give primacy to experiences and relationships that don’t always fit neatly into prearranged schedules.” If you prefer to work on one thing at a time, emphasizing deadlines and seeing interruptions as irritating, you’re monochronic. While I want to be productive, I want so much more to prioritize relationships over industry, to say “this can wait” when I’m fast at work and someone calls with last-minute theater tickets. My monochronic preference for uninterrupted stretches of time in which to work — oh, the exquisite relief of turning on “Do Not Disturb” on my laptop and knowing that it will also silence my phone, my iPad, the text alerts and weather alerts and news alerts and calendar alerts! I tell myself that nothing will feel as good as getting things done, but then I think of the cliché about people on their deathbeds never saying they wish they’d spent more time working. “If your goal is to complete a task, then we need to be monochronic for a window of time and shut out all distractions.” While switching gears may feel uncomfortable for those of us conditioned to do the thing until the thing is done, this framing highlights the stakes.

Article: A police officer was killed after authorities say an active shooter opened fire near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters and Emory University's Atlanta campus on Friday afternoon. Responding DeKalb County police officers located the suspect on the second floor of the Emory Point CVS Pharmacy across the street from the CDC building and attempted to engage the person when gunfire was exchanged, police said. Jeff Amy/AP During the shooting, the suspect fired multiple rounds at the CDC building, breaking windows, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said during an earlier press conference There were 92 children at a day care center on the CDC campus at the time, who were unharmed, police added. Susan Monarez shared a statement on X on Friday night, saying she and the agency as a whole are "heartbroken by today’s attack on our Roybal Campus, which remains on lockdown as authorities investigate the shooting." "Our top priority is the safety and well-being of everyone at CDC," Monarez continued. "We are actively coordinating with federal, state, and local partners to fully investigate the shooter and this tragic crime." In an email to CDC staff, obtained by ABC News, Monarez encourageed employees to "prioritize your well-being, seek support, and reach out for assistance as needed." Monday will be a remote workday for all CDC employees, according to the email. Brian Kemp released a statement on X thanking first responders for rushing "toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives." "We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center," Kemp wrote. WSB-TV Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement Friday, saying, "We're horrified by the news out of Emory University and praying for the safety of the entire campus community." The White House was monitoring the situation, an official told ABC News.

Article: Trump says he'll meet with Putin next Friday in Alaska Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin talk during the family photo session at the APEC Summit in Danang, Vietnam November 11, 2017. "The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska. I just don't want to do it now because of the importance of what we just did," Trump said as he hosted the leaders Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for a peace summit. Asked if this is Russia's last chance to achieve piece, Trump responded, "I don't like using the term 'last chance." "I think my gut instinct really tells me that we have a shot at it. Very disappointed." The White House was pushing for a trilateral summit between Trump, Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though Trump said Putin meeting with Zelenskyy wasn't a condition for he and Putin to meet. "We are ready, together with President Trump, together with all our partners, to work for a real and, most importantly, lasting peace -- a peace that will not collapse because of Moscow’s wishes," Zelenskyy said in a statement on Saturday morning. Reuters/Getty Images/AP Trump, who once said he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within his first 24 hours in office and touted his personal relationship with Putin, has expressed increasing frustration with the Russian leader. He talks, we have such nice conversations, such respectful and nice conversations, and then people die the following night in a -- with a missile going into a town and hitting." Tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalated last week when Trump announced he was moving nuclear submarines in response to what he called "highly provocative statements" from the deputy chair of Russia's security council, Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev, also the former president of Russia, had sounded off on Trump's ceasefire deadline, writing on social media that "each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war." While Trump said the nuclear submarines would be moved in response, he and the White House would not specify what capabilities the submarines have or other questions surrounding the announcement.

Article: A White House official says the Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University. The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. “Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” said Milliken, who started as president last week. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.” California Gov. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: “We will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.” The $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom’s status as one of Trump’s most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents. “Of course it’s influenced by the fact that UCLA sits within the California system and the California system sits within the state of California.” The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

Last week, Whatley, a North Carolina native and resident, entered the race for the GOP nomination, already holding what Trump wrote on social media as his "Complete and Total Endorsement.” Now Nilsson, a former furniture company owner who once ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor, says in a news release that he had decided to suspend his campaign.

(AP Photo/Aimee Dilger) A man fatally shot his neighbor in rural Pennsylvania and then unleashed a hail of gunfire on first responders, wounding two state troopers, running an EMT off the road and sniping a police drone from the sky, officials said. One of the wounded troopers commandeered a tractor trailer to block the roadway and prevent other motorists from driving into harm’s way as police say Faino continued to shoot, targeting a police drone as he holed up near a propane tank that officials feared could be used as a bomb. I would say you can draw certain conclusions from the standpoint that we believe Faino shot our victim prior to our arrival and then from a position of tactical advantage fired dozens and dozens of rounds,” state police Col. He said Trooper Joseph Perechinsky applied a tourniquet to his injured colleague, Trooper William Jenkins, and, despite his own injuries, ordered the driver of a tractor trailer to block the road. A spokesperson for Geisinger, a hospital network where the two wounded troopers are being treated, said in an email that, as of late Friday morning, Jenkins was listed in good condition and Perechinsky in fair condition. The township has long been without its own police force and, like much of Susquehanna County, relies on the state police for emergency response, which is free to local taxpayers.

Article: A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died 'Chimp Crazy' star sentenced to nearly 4 years in prison for lying that primate had died A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died. It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in “confined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures” at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility. Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies “Buddy” and “George of the Jungle.” Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie “Buddy” alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2022 that she lied to protect Tonka from “the evil clutches of PETA.” She also admitted what happened in the third episode of “Chimp Crazy,” which premiered last year, saying, “Tonka was literally on the run with me.” Just last month, investigators found another chimp locked up in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach in violation of court orders, documents in the case said. "In the face of these harsh realities threaded throughout her life, Haddix came to form secure attachments with animals.” PETA praised the sentence in a news release, saying that Haddix now “can't hurt another chimpanzee.”

Article: At the core of the fight in Texas over redrawing the state’s congressional districts is a debate over a time-honored right spelled out in the Constitution: Every two years, “the People” get to pick someone to represent their interests in the U.S. The question is at the heart of a power play in Texas, where Republicans are trying to reshape the state’s congressional boundaries to help them maintain control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. It’s states where one party controls all the levers of government where redistricting dramas like the one in Texas often play out as the majority tries to maximize its power. President Donald Trump, who's pushing Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their maps, said this week Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in Texas based in part on the size of his win there in November. Trump won 56% of the Texas vote, but Republicans already hold 65% of the state's congressional delegation — which would rise to 79% if the GOP's new maps are adopted and past voting patterns hold in the next election. In 41 of the 44 states with more than one congressional district, the party of the winning presidential candidate had a larger share of the state’s congressional seats than its share of the presidential vote, an Associated Press analysis found. Here’s a comparison of the congressional delegations and presidential vote results in a sampling of states, including some of those considering a redraw of their congressional boundaries after Texas called its special session. “You notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered,” he said in reference to the Texas Democrats who relocated to the Chicago area to block, at least temporarily, the Republican redistricting efforts. California's lopsided map is due in part to the way like-minded people cluster: California Democrats tend to live in and near major cities that get more congressional districts because of their population. With Democratic advantages in both chambers of the state Legislature, New York might have been a ripe target for Democrats looking to offset Republican redistricting gains in Texas and elsewhere. After the 2020 census, a Democratic-majority North Carolina Supreme Court threw out a Republican-drawn plan and permitted elections under a map adopted by trial judges that produced the 7-7 split. After flipping to a Republican majority in 2023, the state Supreme Court ruled partisan gerrymandering wasn’t outlawed by the state constitution, allowing GOP lawmakers to redraw a congressional map in use today that led to their party’s 10-4 majority. Nevada, where a Democratic Legislature drew the lines, is the only state where the party of the winning presidential candidate is outnumbered by the other party in the state’s congressional delegation.

Article: A sheriff in one of Massachusetts' largest counties has been charged with allegedly pressuring a Boston-based cannabis firm to give him stock in the company Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins poses for a portrait in the infirmary of the Suffolk County House of Correction in Boston on Sept. Walker/The Boston Globe via AP) BOSTON -- A sheriff in one of Massachusetts' largest counties was charged Friday with allegedly pressuring a Boston-based cannabis firm to sell him stock in the company. "His alleged actions are an affront to the voters and taxpayers who elected him to his position, and the many dedicated and honest public servants at the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department. The people of Suffolk County deserve better.” No one from the sheriff's department could be reached for comment and an attorney for Tompkins did not respond to a request for comment. But when it began to fall a year later, Tompkins alleged demanded his money back and, despite, the decline in the stock's value, the company gave him a full refund. In 2023, Tompkins paid a fine of $12,300 for violating conflict of interest laws after he created a position in his department for his niece and for asking his subordinates to run personal errands for him. If found guilty on the extortion charges, Tompkins could face a sentence of up to 20 years in prison on each count, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.

Article: -- The city of Portland, Oregon, is set to pay $3.75 million to the estate of an unarmed man who was shot and killed by police in 2022 after being mistaken for an armed robbery suspect. An officer mistook the 30-year-old as someone involved in an armed robbery earlier in the evening and shot him in the back as he fled from a police stop in November 2022. An internal affairs investigator had found the officer who shot Clark violated bureau policy; the city’s Police Review Board, which includes four members from the police department, two community members and an independent city staffer, voted 4-3 that the shooting was within policy, OPB reported. Police Chief Bob Day told councilors that while he was angered by Clark's death, it was his final decision to deem the shooting appropriate as he believed Officer Chris Sathoff acted reasonably according to the facts available at the time, OPB reported. The night of the shooting, a 911 caller told dispatchers he had been robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant by men who were “definitely white.” Officers mistook Clark's sedan as being involved in the robbery, and when they approached it in a church parking lot, Clark, who was Black, fled on foot.

Article: The attorney for a Tennessee man who said he was “hurting so bad” during his lethal injection this week says his implanted defibrillator did not shock him during the execution Attorney says heart device did not shock Tennessee man in execution who said he was 'hurting so bad' NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who said he was “hurting so bad” during his lethal injection this week for the 1980s killings of his girlfriend and her two young daughters was not shocked by his implanted defibrillator, his attorney said Friday. The ICD information eliminates one possible cause for Black's comment about pain during his execution Tuesday, and other actions such as when he picked his head up off the gurney and groaned, she said. “Make no mistake, we all saw with our own eyes that the pentobarbital did not work like the State’s expert testified that it would," Henry said in her statement, referencing Tennessee's execution drug, pentobarbital. Black suffered.” Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to disable his ICD due to claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks to try to fix his heartbeat as the drugs were administered, potentially prolonging the execution. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Friday that news of the lack of a defibrillator shock was “just as the state’s medical expert predicted and entirely contrary to the confident predictions of Black’s expert.” Skrmetti cited Black’s numerous failed legal challenges and said, “Byron Black’s execution was entirely legal.” “Every American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty, but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion,” Skrmetti said in a statement. Ahead of that, when he was asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution began, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it’s hurting so bad,” Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his right arm visible to media witnesses. Before the execution, the state said in a court filing that a "lethal dose of pentobarbital ensures that Black will not be conscious to experience any pain." The state said unconsciousness occurs within 20 to 30 seconds of administering the drug, followed by respiratory arrest and cardiovascular collapse.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) FILE 0 United States Vice President JD Vance, right, and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Feb. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday at a stately home south of London before heading off on a family vacation in the the Cotswolds, a trendy retreat in the English countryside. Vance and Lammy, who come from opposite ends of the political spectrum but have made a personal connection through their hardscrabble childhoods and Christian faith, will hold talks at the foreign secretary’s official country residence, known as Chevening. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also likely to be on the agenda amid debates between Washington and London about the best way to end those conflicts. Lammy and Vance will meet at Chevening, an almost 400-year-old mansion surrounded by 3,000 acres (about 1,200 hectares) of gardens, lawns and woodland in the county of Kent, southeast of London. While Lammy is a member of the left-leaning Labour Party and Vance is a conservative Republican who supports Trump’s “America First” agenda, the two men have bonded in recent months. Lammy told the Guardian newspaper that the two men can relate over their “dysfunctional” working class childhoods and that he considers Vance a “friend.” Lammy attended a Catholic Mass at the Vance home in Washington earlier this year, and the two men met again at the U.S. “So it was a wonderful hour and a half.” After spending a few days at Chevening, Vance and his family will head to the Cotswolds, an area that has become popular with wealthy American tourists because of its quaint villages, stone cottages and rural countryside that hark back to old England. A host of celebrities descended on the area two weeks ago for the wedding of Eve Jobs, the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, and Harry Charles, a member of the British equestrian team at last summer’s Olympic Games in Paris.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) HOUSTON -- A yearslong legal fight over the release of audio and video recordings and other records related to the May 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, is coming closer to an end. Media organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. The school district is expected to release police service and 911 call records; evidence logs related to the shooting; body-worn and security camera footage from Robb Elementary; student files for the shooter; internal communications among district officials; and results of school safety audits. It could also make public personnel files and other records related to Pete Arredondo, the former Uvalde schools police chief who was fired and indicted for his role in the police response. Records from the county are expected to include incident and 911 reports concerning Robb Elementary and other locations; sheriff dispatch logs and radio traffic; video footage; ballistics and evidence logs; and reports of law enforcement interactions with the shooter and his mother.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) WASHINGTON -- An advocacy group sued the Justice Department and the FBI on Friday for records detailing their handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled. “The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials. Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on Epstein and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation.

Article: An executive order signed by President Donald Trump aims to give political appointees power over the billions of dollars of grants that are awarded by federal agencies President Donald Trump speaks at an event to mark National Purple Heart Day in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Aug. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) NEW YORK -- An executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Thursday aims to give political appointees power over the billions of dollars in grants awarded by federal agencies. The order requires all federal agencies, including FEMA, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, to appoint officials responsible for reviewing federal funding opportunities and grants, so that they “are consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.” It also requires agencies to make it so that current and future federal grants can be terminated at any time — including during the grant period itself. The Trump administration said these changes are part of an effort to “strengthen oversight” and “streamline agency grantmaking.” Scientists say the order will cripple America's scientific engine by placing control over federal research funds in the hands of people who are influenced by politics and lack relevant expertise. “This is taking political control of a once politically neutral mechanism for funding science in the U.S.,” said Joseph Bak-Coleman, a scientist studying group decision-making at the University of Washington. The changes will delay grant review and approval, slowing "progress for cures and treatments that patients and families across the country urgently need,” said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement. The administration has already terminated thousands of research grants at agencies like the NSF and NIH, including on topics like transgender health, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion. The order could affect emergency relief grants doled out by FEMA, public safety initiatives funded by the Department of Justice and public health efforts supported by the Centers for Disease Control.

Article: -- Federal judges on Thursday ordered Alabama to continue using a court-selected congressional map for the rest of the decade, but they declined to put the state back under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act. The three-judge panel ordered the secretary of state to continue using the current congressional map, which was selected by the court last year, “until Alabama enacts a new congressional districting plan based on 2030 Census data” and said they will retain jurisdiction over the case until then. The judges rejected a request from plaintiffs to “bail in” Alabama under the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act and submit the next-state-drawn congressional map for review before it is used. The judges wrote that they “discern no compelling reason to tread into such intrusive waters.” “And we will not, in an unrestrained attempt to resolve any hypothetical issue that may arise far down the road, assign to our Court the exceedingly intrusive task of supervising Alabama’s congressional elections for the next fifteen years,” the judges wrote. Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, had argued during a July hearing that preclearance was needed to ensure the state doesn’t “backslide.” Ross said Friday that even though the court rejected preclearance, his clients are pleased the court ordered Alabama to continue using the special master map through 2030. “This independently-drawn map respects Alabama’s many communities of interest, including the Black Belt, and ensures that Black voters will have a fair opportunity to elect congressional candidates of their choice for the rest of the decade,” Ross said.

Article: Adam Schiff, according to people familiar with the matter WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is escalating efforts to scrutinize perceived adversaries of President Donald Trump with investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and U.S. The Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to a lawsuit the Democrat filed against Trump over alleged fraud in his personal business dealings, according to a person familiar with the matter. The moves are among the most serious yet the Justice Department has taken against political foes of the president, who vowed on the campaign trail to seek retribution against his opponents. Schiff and James are both vocal critics of Trump, and James has sued Trump and his Republican administration dozens of times over his policies as president and over how he conducted his private business empire. News of the subpoenas comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” In a separate statement, James’ personal attorney, Abbe D. Lowell, called the subpoenas “improper.” “Investigating the fraud case Attorney General James won against President Trump and his businesses has to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign,” Lowell said. “Weaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration.” A spokesperson for the Justice Department, Natalie Baldassarre, declined to comment. “Any supposed investigation led by him would be the very definition of weaponization of the justice process.” Trump is appealing a $454 million judgment James won against him in a lawsuit alleging he and his companies defrauded banks and other lenders by giving them financial statements that inflated the value of his properties, including his golf clubs and his penthouse in Trump Tower. A jury last year found that LaPierre misspent millions of dollars of the organization’s money and used the funds to pay for an extravagant lifestyle, while the NRA itself failed to properly manage its assets and violated whistleblower protections. James had sought to dissolve the powerful gun advocacy organization altogether, though a judge ruled that the allegations did not warrant a “corporate death penalty.” LaPierre announced his resignation from the NRA on the eve of the trial, and the NRA later said it had fresh board members and a new compliance team.

(AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis) NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer’s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association. Didarul Islam — one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL’s headquarters — was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty. Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community. Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. “His legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.” When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells. Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved. The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them. “I never dreamt that I would go this far, but I always had an ambition to go somewhere where I can be challenged,” said Siddique, now a member of Mayor Eric Adams' security detail. Give me a chance.” Ishmam Chowdhury, a 26-year-old officer who graduated from the academy in May, said Islam’s death just a few months into his own career has left a lasting impression. “So yeah, I guess that’s a wake-up call for us that even though this is a noble job, we are definitely at grave risk.” Chowdhury said he dreamed of joining law enforcement even before he immigrated to the U.S. He also served about a year in the police force in Washington, D.C., after it opened applications to green card holders in 2023, but he and his wife felt isolated from friends and family.

Article: House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress. In an online post, Page wrote that state rules require the governor to issue a proclamation calling a statewide election at least 148 days before the date of the election — that would have been June 9. Page said if he waited for the Legislature and the governor to formally call the election, “it would be too late for me to actually conduct the election.” If it goes through, “We are going to make this work,” Page added.

Article: Webster looks on during the commemoration of the bloodiest events in the Bureau's history on the 25th anniversary of a Miami shootout in which two agents were killed, in North Miami Beach, Fla., April 11, 2011. Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith) PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Hundreds of Buddhist monks in Cambodia on Friday held a religious ceremony to honor soldiers killed in recent border clashes with Thai forces and to pray for peace. They marched from the country’s main religious school near the Royal Palace in the capital, Phnom Penh, to a nearby temple, where they were joined by nuns and laymen and women. A ceasefire that took effect on July 29 ended major fighting, though both sides have alleged violations of the truce and the underlying dispute over territorial claims has not been resolved. Khem Sorn, the chief monk for Phnom Penh, said the main purpose of Friday’s ceremony was to show support to the government for working toward peace and ending the war with a ceasefire. It was also intended to honor to the souls of the Cambodian soldiers and civilians who were killed, and to appeal to all Buddhist countries, especially Thailand, to live in peace with each other, he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Talks in Malaysia on Thursday reaffirmed both sides’ commitment to the ceasefire deal but failed to secure the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers, who were captured in disputed circumstances after the truce went into effect. The United States and China, which both played an active role in encouraging an end to the fighting, separately hailed Thursday’s reaffirmation of the ceasefire, and said they look forward to supporting the parties involved in securing the peace process.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment Thursday that “Putin remains uninterested in ending his war and is attempting to extract bilateral concessions from the United States without meaningfully engaging in a peace process.” “Putin continues to believe that time is on Russia’s side and that Russia can outlast Ukraine and the West,” it said. Orbán said the leaders of Germany and France should go to Moscow “to negotiate on behalf of Europe.” Otherwise, “we will be sidelined in managing the security issues of our own continent,” Orbán told Hungary’s state broadcaster. Orbán, who is a harsh critic of the European Union to which his country belongs, said Europe’s concerns that a Trump-Putin summit might not address the continent’s interests meant it should seize the diplomatic initiative.

The family said it was Lungu's final wish that Hichilema should not get anywhere near his burial, but the Zambian government went to court to stop him being buried in South Africa. “Such that even if a president has expressed a desire not to be given a state funeral, such a wish must be overridden by public interest,” said Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba. Zambia's Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha welcomed the judgment, telling reporters that he hoped the ruling would bring the matter to a close even though the family still had a right to appeal. It's just what makes good sense, that the former president of the Republic of Zambia should be buried in his own country, the country where he was president,” said Kabesha.

The army said in a statement late Friday that it is “fiercely condemning a series of mass murders of civilians by the RDF/M23-AFC coalition" in South Kivu, including of 80 people on Aug. human rights chief said that M23 killed 319 people over the past month in a different part of the region, describing the toll as one of the largest documented in such attacks since the M23 rebels resurfaced in 2022. human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the rebels, backed by members of the Rwandan Defense Force, targeted four villages in North Kivu province’s Rutshuru territory between July 9 and July 21. “We call for the opening of an independent investigation and hope that the organizations that published this report can participate in it.” The M23 earlier this year seized two key cities in eastern Congo, in a major escalation with the help of neighboring Rwandan forces. The two sides on July 19 signed a declaration of principles in Qatar to end the fighting and commit to a comprehensive peace agreement that would include the restoration of state authorities in key eastern cities controlled by the insurgents.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the planned summit between U_S_ President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that any peace deal excluding Kyiv would lead to “dead solutions.” Zelenskyy rejects formally ceding Ukrainian territory, says Kyiv must be part of any negotiations KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Saturday the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that any peace deal excluding Kyiv would lead to “dead solutions.” The Trump-Putin meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, is seen as a potential breakthrough. Trump had previously agreed to meet with Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy, stoking fears Ukraine could be sidelined in efforts to stop the continent’s biggest conflict since World War II. In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be non-negotiable and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine’s voice at the table. Zelenskyy said Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Touching on Ukrainian anxieties that a direct meeting between Putin and Trump could marginalize Kyiv and European interests, Zelenskyy said: “Any solutions that are without Ukraine, are at the same time, solutions against peace. These are dead solutions, they will never work.” Ukrainian officials had previously told the Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine’s inability to regain lost territories militarily. “It seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement posted to the Kremlin's news channel. Such a summit may prove pivotal in a war that began more than three years ago when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there’s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. In comments to reporters at the White House before his post confirming the date and place, Trump suggested that any agreement would likely involve “some swapping of territories,” but he gave no details. Exasperated that Putin did not heed his calls to stop bombing Ukrainian cities, Trump, almost two weeks ago, moved up his ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement.

Article: Trust in Zelenskyy is diminished even after reversal of law that fueled protests FILE - Ukrainian lawmakers vote for a new bill proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to restore the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies at the parliament session hall in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) FILE - Ukrainian lawmakers vote for a new bill proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to restore the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies at the parliament session hall in Kyiv, Ukraine, July 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Vadym Sarakhan, File) KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country’s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia’s invasion. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties. But the previous level of trust “that he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged," said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy "will need to work hard to get it back.” A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law. The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore “lost trust.” Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, or SAPO. The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime. “It’s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,” Shevchuk said. Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions. Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy’s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported that the NABU and the SAPO were in the process of issuing a formal notice of suspicion against the businessman, who is involved in drone production. "But at the same time, people know what is happening with the close allies of the president, the allegations of corruption, so this does not go unnoticed.” The protests "were a reminder to the president from the people basically saying, ‘We see everything, remember everything. A readout of the call from Starmer’s office said the leaders "agreed on the importance of the role of independent anti-corruption institutions at the heart of Ukraine’s democracy.” In Germany, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed dismay when Zelenskyy approved the measures to reduce the powers of the NABU and the SAPO.

Article: An Australian court has heard a husband suspected his wife of poisoning him over a year before she murdered three of his relatives with toxic mushrooms Husband suspected wife of poisoning him before she killed 3 relatives MELBOURNE, Australia -- The husband of a woman convicted of killing three people with a meal laced with deadly mushrooms suspected his wife had been poisoning him more than a year before the fatal meal, an Australian court has heard. “I thought there’d be a risk that she’d poison me if I attended,” the husband told the court months before the trial in testimony that was not presented to jurors. Erin Patterson was convicted by a Victoria state Supreme Court last month of murdering her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail’s sister Heather Wilkinson at her home in Leongatha with a lunch of beef Wellington pastries contained toxic death cap mushrooms. Simon Patterson testified before the trial that he suspected his wife had deliberately made him seriously ill with dishes including penne bolognese pasta, chicken korma curry and a vegetable curry wrap. Defense lawyer Colin Mandy argued that reporting of the suppressed evidence as well as references to it in books, podcasts and a planned television mini-series would “leave an indelible impression on the minds of potential jurors in the event that there is a retrial.” A hearing will begin on Aug.

(Monique Ford/Stuff via AP) Two ships from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, JS Ise and destroyer JS Suzunami sail into Wellington, New Zealand to begin a three-day ceremonial port visit, Friday, Aug. (Monique Ford/Stuff via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Japanese warships docked in New Zealand ’s capital Friday for the first time in almost 90 years amid efforts by Tokyo to deepen its strategic ties in the South Pacific Ocean. The JS Ise and destroyer JS Suzunami were on an Indo-Pacific deployment and arrived from Sydney, where Japan’s military took part this month in war games involving New Zealand, Australia and other countries. The Wellington visit was a ceremonial one, but it came as Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions. “Our main goal is the free and open Indo-Pacific.” The ambassador’s remarks followed the announcement Tuesday by Australia’s government that Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had won the bid for a contract to build Australian warships, beating out a German firm. New Zealand too has sought to shore up its strategic and military relations in Asia as part of a foreign policy reset in recent years that the government says has turned more attention on Pacific cooperation and security. Japanese naval vessels do not often make visits so far south in the Pacific Ocean, but the rich and strategically important waters of New Zealand, Australia and smaller Pacific Island countries are increasingly contested by the world’s major powers, making it the site of a fierce battle for influence between Beijing and Western nations. In February, live firing exercises by Chinese naval frigates in the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia drew alarm from those countries’ governments after flights were forced to divert at short notice.

Article: Two Indian soldiers and a suspected militant have been killed in one of longest gunfights in Indian-controlled Kashmir SRINAGAR, India -- Two Indian soldiers and a suspected militant have been killed in one of longest gunfights in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Saturday. Last month, India’s powerful home minister Amit Shah said in parliament that three suspected militants killed in a gunbattle in the disputed region were responsible for a shooting massacre in which more than two dozen people died and that led to a military clash between India and Pakistan earlier this year. Before the April gun massacre in the Kashmiri resort town of Pahalgam, the fighting had largely ebbed in the region’s Kashmir Valley, the heartland of anti-India rebellion, and mainly shifted to mountainous areas of Jammu in the past few years. The massacre increased tensions between India and Pakistan, leading to the worst military confrontation in decades and the death of dozens of people, until a ceasefire was reached on May 10 after U.S mediation.

Article: SAO PAULO -- Police in Rio de Janeiro carried out raids against a criminal group Friday that allegedly operated a clandestine ride-hailing app that generated monthly profits of up to 1 million reais (about $185,000), authorities said. Officials said in a statement that Comando Vermelho, one of Brazil’s most notorious criminal organizations, coerced motorcycle drivers into installing a ride-hailing app developed by the group and using it in Vila Kennedy, a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. Originating in Rio de Janeiro’s prison system in the late 1970s, the group has expanded its operations into other criminal businesses, including international cocaine trafficking, and it also controls territory in several of Rio’s working-class neighborhoods. Uber launched its motorcycle ride service in Rio in January 2023 and, two years later, the company said in a statement that it had transported 3 million users and registered 100,000 drivers.

Article: Representatives from Syria's ethnic and religious groups have called for a decentralized state and a new constitution ensuring pluralism HASSAKEH, Syria -- Hundreds of representatives of Syria’s various ethnic and religious groups called Friday for the formation of a decentralized state and the drafting of a new constitution that guarantees religious, cultural and ethnic pluralism. The declaration came at the conclusion of a one-day conference where some 400 representatives of Syria's ethnic and religious minorities gathered in an attempt to assert the rights of their communities in the country’s evolving political framework following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last December. In their statements, the representatives condemned recent acts of violence by pro-government gunmen against the country’s minorities — primarily Alawites, Druze and Christians — and argued that these amount to crimes against humanity. Ghazal Ghazal, the spiritual leader of Syria’s Alawite minority, to whom Assad belongs, said extremist ideology in Syria is imposing its will on Syrians in the name of religion and killing minorities. Hakemat Habib, one of the conference organizers, said that central governments and “tyrannical regimes” over the past decades have failed and that a democratic and decentralized state agreed upon by all Syrians is the only way to move forward. Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, whose fighters clashed with pro-government gunmen last month, told the conference in a televised speech that “pluralism is not a threat but a treasure that strengthens unity.” Also Friday, a top commander with the SDF, Sipan Hamo, blasted al-Sharaa’s government and accused it of continuing Syria's decades-old “dictatorship.” Hamo said in an interview with a local media outlet that the SDF wants to join the national army but the al-Sharaa’s government is not giving hope for a democratic state.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) A North Korean military guard post, loudspeaker, top right, and South Korean military guard post, bottom, are seen from Paju, South Korea, near the border with North Korea, Monday, Aug. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s military said Saturday it detected North Korea removing some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, days after the South dismantled its own front-line speakers used for anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts, in a bid to ease tensions. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t disclose the sites where the North Koreans were removing speakers and said it wasn’t immediately clear whether the North would take all of them down. In recent months, South Korean border residents have complained that North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda broadcasts. The South Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June after Seoul’s new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, halted the South’s broadcasts in his government’s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals. South Korea’s military began removing its speakers from border areas on Monday but didn't specify how they would be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed if tensions flared again. North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn’t immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers. The speakers blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs, a playlist designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim has been pushing an intense campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family’s dynastic rule. The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea’s advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan. Lee, who took office in June after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, wants to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon’s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue. But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, rebuffed overtures by Lee’s government in late July, saying that Seoul’s “blind trust” in the country’s alliance with the United States makes it no different from its conservative predecessor. She later issued a separate statement dismissing the Trump administration’s intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea’s denuclearization, suggesting that Pyongyang — now focused on expanding ties with Russia over the war in Ukraine — sees little urgency in resuming talks with Seoul or Washington. Tensions between the Koreas can possibly rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. North Korea labels the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.

Article: Worries rise for civilians and hostages JERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, drawing a dismissal from the militant group and renewed international calls to end the conflict, while stirring fears for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told The Associated Press. Before Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had outlined more sweeping plans Thursday in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. “The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. Asked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza,” Netanyahu replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.” He added that Israel did not intend to “keep it.” Israel's new plan stopped short of that, and may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel's terms. Eyal Zamir, who reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years of regional wars. The military “will prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,” Netanyahu's office said in a statement after the meeting. Amir Avivi, a retired brigadier general and chairman of Israel’s Defense and Security Forum, estimated it would take less than three months to mobilize some 30,000 troops, evacuate Palestinian civilians and take over Gaza City. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media, said the group’s leadership has been aware of the Arab mediators’ efforts to revive the ceasefire talks, but has yet to receive details. envoy Steve Witkoff told hostage families during his recent visit that Israel was shifting its approach to pursue a comprehensive “all-or-nothing” deal aimed at ending the war and securing the release of hostages, a person who attended the meeting told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak about the private meeting.

Article: The pet of choice in Japan, as much as cuddly kitties and playful puppies, is the humble bug Toyoji Suzuki holds a beetle, known as Hercules, at an exhibition devoted to insects in Tokyo, Thursday, July 31, 2025. The bug has been a key part of Japanese culture from the Heian era classic “The Tale of Genji” to popular modern-day manga and animation like “Mushishi,” featuring insect-like supernatural creatures. If you catch and study them, you’re sure to discover something new,” says Munetoshi Maruyama, professor of bioenvironmental sciences at Kyushu University, whose fascination with bugs began as a child, like many Japanese. “They are so beautiful in shape and form.” One thrill that comes from studying insects is discovering a new species, simply because there are more than 1.2 million known kinds of insects, far more than mammals, which translates to a lot of undiscovered ones, said Maruyama, who has discovered 250 new insect species himself and shrugs that off as a relatively small number. “It’s fantastic that bugs can serve as a doorway to science.” The fact some insects go through metamorphoses, transforming from a larva to a butterfly, for instance, adds to the excitement, allowing kids to observe the stages of a life span, Maruyama said. The love affair with bugs was clear at an exhibit in Tokyo, aptly called “The Great Insect Exhibition,” running through the end of this month at the Sky Tree Tower, where crowds of children gathered around trees inside indoor cages so they could observe and touch the various beetles. One kind of rhinoceros beetle known as Hercules, which originated in the Caribbean but is now also found in Japan, is reputed to be the biggest beetle on record, although it’s just several inches in length. That’s really positive for the workings of a child’s brain,” said Toyoji Suzuki, one of the event’s organizers, who insisted everyone, including adults, touch the bottom of the beetles’ horns and wings to feel how surprisingly soft and fluffy they are. Four-year-old Asahi Yamauchi, who was at the exhibit with his grandmother and getting his photo taken inside a special installation that made it look like he was inside a beetle, loves bugs as much as he loves dinosaurs and has what he called a cute beetle as a pet at home.

About 3,000 people, including representatives from 95 countries, were expected to attend the event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were scheduled to speak.

(Peter Meecham/AAP Image via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The leaders of New Zealand and Australia on Saturday discussed closer cooperation between their expanding militaries against the backdrop of a recent extraordinary Chinese live-fire exercise near their shores. “We want to be one, sort of, essential Anzac force essentially operating within our region,” he added, referring to the Australian New Zealand Army Corps in which the two nations’ soldiers first fought together during World War I. Albanese said last month that he complained to China’s President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing about the lack of notice the Chinese had given of the live-fire exercise. Albanese and Luxon recognized their countries face the most unpredictable and dangerous strategic environment in decades and their alliance plays a critical role in protecting and advancing their shared interest in the region, they said in a joint statement. “We genuinely are able to have a conversation — I think a very mature one now — to say, look, we do have very different histories, we do have different systems, we do have different values, that does mean we do have differences. He described the rise from around 1% over the past two decades as “a big step up for us.” In a demonstration of Tokyo seeking deeper strategic ties in the South Pacific, Japanese warships docked in New Zealand on Friday for the first time in almost 90 years.

Article: As federal takeover threats loom, the city of Washington waits for the White House to make its move FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in coming evenings as Trump puts into action his longstanding plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” On Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night's operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later doubled down on those comments, telling reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the NPS has aggressively stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier this week, the NPS announced that a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced in line with an Executive Order.

Article: Lindsey Graham, shuttering his effort to oust the four-term incumbent after just more than a month and eschewing a “political climate that rewards deception over honesty, or ambition over unity.” In posts on social media, Bauer wrote Friday that he had decided to shutter his campaign “after deep prayer and reflection,” saying he believed “we must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.” He stopped short of endorsing any of the remaining candidates in the race to challenge Graham, who already has backing from President Donald Trump. In a pre-launch interview with The Associated Press, Bauer described himself as “a real, America First conservative” intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives’ true values, and he said “Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it.” Republicans dominate South Carolina’s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries. Graham — whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years — has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change. For this cycle, Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February and quickly secured Trump’s endorsement, and Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump’s 2024 bid, is serving as a senior adviser. At his 2024 campaign’s South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer, who served on his state leadership committee, “a friend of mine, somebody that could, I think, run for almost any office and win.” Bauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at age 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002.

Article: House districts and counter rival moves by Texas Republicans has created a dilemma for county officials who are being urged to plan for an election that hasn't been scheduled and might never happen. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-dominated Legislature already have blown past deadlines intended to give local officials adequate time for organizing everything from printing mail ballots in multiple languages to lining up staff and securing locations for in-person voting. Though an election has not been called, “staff around the state need to begin preparing for the possibility of a special election,” Weber spokesperson Jim Patrick said in an email. “It’s a risk I have to take.” Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan, who oversees elections in the county of nearly 10 million people, warned that “without upfront state funding and a clearly defined calendar, counties can face challenges meeting the demands of an election.” "Ensuring voters are served accurately, securely, and equitably must remain the top priority, and that takes preparation,” Logan added in a statement. He pointed to California’s existing maps, which are drawn by an independent commission unlike the Texas maps crafted by a partisan legislature: “They did it to us.” Other states — including New York, Florida and Indiana — could get into the power struggle that’s emerging as a national proxy war for control of Congress. In an online post, Page wrote that state rules require the governor to issue a proclamation calling a statewide election at least 148 days before the date of the election — that would have been June 9. Page said if he waited for the Legislature and the governor to formally call the election, “it would be too late for me to actually conduct the election.” If it goes through, “We are going to make this work,” Page added.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez) AUSTIN, Texas -- A weeklong walkout by Texas House Democrats is blocking redrawn congressional maps sought by President Donald Trump and put in motion a broadening fight across the U.S. There is still no swift end in sight to the standoff that has scattered dozens of Texas Democrats to Illinois, New York and California, where they have been given a warm reception by blue state governors and national party leaders. Congressional maps are typically redrawn once every 10 years to coincide with population shifts captured by the census and is rare for it to occur in the middle of the decade. In Florida, the speaker of the house said the chamber will take up this issue in a special redistricting committee this fall, and Vice President JD Vance met with Republican Indiana Gov. Texas Democrats face fines of up to $500 each day they are absent from the chamber, a rule that was adopted after the party walked in 2021 over a bill that tightened voting restrictions.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: The Trump administration wants to end two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump's budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn't, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

(Azerbaijani Presidential Press Office via AP) WASHINGTON -- The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a peace deal Friday at the White House that could potentially put an end to decades of conflict, President Donald Trump said. to “pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.” “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,’” Trump wrote Thursday night on his Truth Social site. The prospective agreement could potentially put an end to decades of conflict and set the stage for a reopening of key transportation corridors across the South Caucasus that have been shut since the early 1990s. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreements included a major breakthrough establishing a key transit corridor across the region, which had been a hang-up in peace talks The agreement, according to the officials, would give the U.S. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fueled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years. When the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan. “Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine. The prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran. Turkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. “For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.

His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican plan for congressional redistricting are pleading for donations to help cover their costs After leaving Texas for Illinois to prevent a legislative vote on a Republican redistricting plan, state House Democratic leader Gene Wu needed a means to project his voice — and viewpoints — to a national audience. Now Texas Democrats are pleading for donations to help finance what could be a walkout of weeks — if not months — in a high-stakes attempt to prevent the Republican majority from passing a plan sought by President Donald Trump. “We’re getting a lot of small-dollar donations,” Wu told The Associated Press, "and that’s going to be used to help keep this thing going.” A political group led by Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, gave money to the Texas House Democratic Caucus to help cover the up-front costs, according to a spokesperson for the group, Powered by People. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said Wednesday he's launching an investigation into whether O'Rourke's group has committed bribery by a “financial influence scheme” benefiting Democrats who left Texas. Not only could Texas Democrats face thousands of dollars in out-of-state lodging and dining costs, they also could eventually face fines of $500 for each day they are absent, which under House rules cannot be paid from their office budgets or political contributions. Jose Menendez joined Democrats from other states at a rally in Boston, where he noted that the potential daily fine for quorum-breaking lawmakers is nearly as large as their entire monthly legislative salary. Some Democrats in the Texas Senate have traveled out of state this week to support their House colleagues, but lawmakers in that chamber are not leaving the state to hold up legislative business. We don’t have billionaires who are funding this operation.” The House Democratic Caucus has set up a website seeking donations of between $25 and $2,500 — with a default amount of $250. Earlier this week, Abbott asked the state's highest court to remove Wu from office and ordered the Texas Rangers to investigate possible bribery charges related to how Democrats are paying for the walkout, alleging anyone who financially helped them could be culpable. Before Democrats decided to leave Texas, Wu said he called potential allies for assurance “that there would be resources that would come to our assistance.” But he said that's no different from an aspiring candidate asking others for support before officially launching a campaign. Texas Democrats aren’t worried that they'll be forced to return home in the near future because of a lack of money, said Luke Warford, founder of Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund, a Texas fundraising and organizing group. But "when you think about it in the context of what Donald Trump has to gain and what Democrats might lose in the short term, it’s just not even close to the cost of trying to win back either these races or a bunch of other races in the country.” The Democratic lawmakers have been holed up at a hotel and conference center outside Chicago that was evacuated Wednesday after an unfounded bomb threat. "Our hotel bills seem so minor compared to what we’re trying to do — to protect democracy.” ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report.

Article: Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said the additional $600 million provided annually for Medicaid is hundreds of millions short and unless addressed would require reducing optional services, provider rates or both. “This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care," Stein said in a news release. “Despite these serious reservations, I am signing this bill into law because it keeps the lights on.” The new law does cover anticipated enrollment changes for K-12 schools and community colleges, as well as for experience-based pay raises already in state law for teachers. Stein's veto seeks to block a decision by North Carolina legislative leaders to join the tax-credit program contained in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill that he signed into law last month. The program provides starting in 2027 a one-to-one credit equal to up to $1,700 for those who donate to certain “scholarship granting organizations,” with those distributing K-12 private-school scholarships among them. The federal law said each state must opt in to the program, and North Carolina Republicans who have already greatly expanded state-funded scholarships wanted North Carolina to be the first to do so. Stein's veto message aligned with arguments by Democratic state legislators who voted against the state measure last week that the program shifts federal funding away from helping public schools and helps wealthy people who can already afford private school for their children. Stein said he would opt in to the program for the state once the federal government issued sound written guidance on program rules because he sees opportunities to “benefit North Carolina’s public school kids.” So, he added, the bill on his desk is “unnecessary.” The vetoed bill now returns to the General Assembly, where override votes could happen as early as Aug. Republicans are but one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority, and last week lawmakers were able to gain the Democratic support needed to override eight of Stein's 14 earlier vetoes. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said Wednesday that with the veto Stein is "attempting to usurp the General Assembly’s authority to set tax policy” and anticipated a veto override "to ensure North Carolina can participate in President Trump’s signature school choice initiative.” Stein also signed Wednesday legislation creating an expedited removal process for homeowners and landlords to remove people unauthorized to live on their property.

Vance's visit comes after Texas Democrats successfully stalled a vote there this week on a redrawn congressional map, part of a bid to secure five more GOP-leaning congressional seats at the expense of Democrats before the midterms. Indiana is staunchly Republican, but opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. But Indiana is also home to Mike Pence, the former vice president and a past governor whose more measured approach to partisan politics still holds sway among many state lawmakers. Frank Mrvan has been seen as a possible pickup in recent years as manufacturing union jobs have left the area, said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes that also gave a boost to the GOP in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. In a statement Tuesday, Mrvan said the Trump administration knows its policies are “wildly unpopular.” “They know that their only hope to maintain control is to pressure the Indiana General Assembly to violate the Indiana Constitution and redistrict U.S. Julia Vaughn, director of Common Cause Indiana, said a costly redistricting process will not look good for Republicans who tightened the belt on the state budget this past legislative session due to revenue forecasts. “I don’t think there is any way they could rationalize spending taxpayer dollars to come back to Indianapolis to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago for purely partisan purposes,” Vaughn said.

(Ramsey County Sheriff's Office via AP, File) MINNEAPOLIS -- The man charged with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. As they announced the indictment, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter’s federal defender, Manny Atwal, said at the time that the weighty charges did not come as a surprise, but she has not commented on the substance of the allegations or any defense strategies. "Accordingly, the discovery to be produced by the government will include a substantial amount of investigative material and reports from more than a dozen different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.” They said the evidence will include potentially thousands of hours of video footage, tens of thousands of pages of responses to dozens of grand jury subpoenas, and data from numerous electronic devices seized during the investigation. In a series of cryptic notes to The New York Times through his jail’s electronic messaging service, Boelter suggested his actions were partly rooted in the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbor. In messages published earlier by the New York Post, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate. He also reiterated that prosecutors consider Hortman's killing a “political assassination.” Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans’ home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin.

Article: Burt Jones over how Jones is financing his campaign as both Republicans run for governor in 2026 ATLANTA -- One of the top Republicans running for Georgia governor on Thursday sued the other leading GOP candidate, challenging the legality of the rival's campaign funding. Burt Jones in federal court in Atlanta, asking a judge to permanently cut off Jones' ability to spend money from Jones' leadership committee, a special fundraising vehicle that allows Georgia's governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders to raise unlimited funds. Carr argues that the leadership committee violates Carr's First Amendment right to free speech as well as his 14th Amendment right to equal protection by setting up a campaign finance structure that favors Jones and limits how much Carr can spend on his campaign. Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone said Jones “is using his position to sidestep contribution limits, raise six-figure checks during legislative sessions and funnel unlimited money into a competitive primary through a structure only he can access.” Jones' campaign spokesperson Kendyl Parker called Carr a hypocrite because his office in 2022 defended the same law he is now challenging. The Carr campaign tried to get the state Ethics Commission to investigate the source of a $10 million loan that Jones made to his leadership committee, but the commission declined, saying Carr failed to allege a legal violation. Carr asks the court to block Jones from giving any cash to dark money groups and making any loans to his regular campaign committee during the primary, and wants the magistrate judge to investigate where Jones' $10 million loan came from. Carr's campaign continues to voice concern that Jones could raise unlimited sums to repay his loan and then give the repaid money to his candidate committee to spend in the primary, warning that such laundering would destroy campaign contribution limits.

Article: The Voting Rights Act was signed into law 60 years ago but has been slowly eroding for more than a decade The Voting Rights Act marks its 60th anniversary as its core provisions are being eroded North Dakota Democratic Rep. Jayme Davis poses for a photo in her office with a 2024 campaign sign on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, at Turtle Mountain Administrative Offices on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota. The law has been slowly eroding for more than a decade, starting with the 2013 Supreme Court decision ending the requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting get federal approval before changing the way they hold elections. The Supreme Court upheld a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, but in its upcoming term it's scheduled to hear a case that could roll back that decision and another that would effectively neuter the law. I say that because there are so many attacks on voting rights, particularly as it relates to Black communities and communities of color." The reservation of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border, a region of forests, small lakes and vast prairie land. “I felt, OK, it’s time for us to really start making change and really start educating from within so that we’re not silenced.” Brown, a Democrat, co-sponsored several bills on Native American issues that became law, including aid for repatriation of remains and artifacts and alerts for missing Indigenous people. This year's anniversary of the Voting Rights Act “forces you to look at how far we’ve come,” from Native Americans to women, said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain tribe. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers North Dakota and six other states, overturned Welte's decision 2-1, saying the tribes and entities such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the ACLU do not have a right to sue over potential violations of voters' constitutional rights. The University of Michigan Law School Voting Rights Initiative found that since 1982 nearly 87% of claims under that part of the Voting Rights Act, known as Section 2, were from private individuals and organizations. Leaving individuals without the ability to file challenges is especially troublesome now because the Justice Department under Trump, a Republican, seems focused on other priorities, said Sophia Lin Lakin, who heads the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. The government’s voting rights unit has been dismantled and given new priorities that, she said, have turned enforcement “against the very people it was created to protect." The Justice Department declined to answer questions about its voting rights priorities, cases it is pursuing or whether it would be involved in the voting rights cases coming before the nation's highest court. Two years ago, voting rights activists celebrated when the Supreme Court preserved Section 2 in a case out of Alabama that required the state to draw an addition congressional district to benefit Black voters. In an order on Friday, the court asked the lawyers to supply briefs explaining “whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. Constitution.” Robert Weiner, the director of voting rights for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said while it is a “matter of concern” that the court is asking the question, the fact the nine justices did not reach a decision during the last term suggests there weren’t five votes already. Democrats have reintroduced the John Lewis voting rights bill, but it's legislation they failed to pass in 2022 when they held both houses of Congress and the White House and needed some Republican support in the Senate. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order seeking to overhaul voting in the states, which includes a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement on the federal voting form, though much of it has been blocked in the courts. The slow chipping away at the 60-year-old law has created a nation with an unequal distribution of voting rights, said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights center at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

Article: House Several states consider redrawing congressional maps after Texas kicks off fight Empty chairs belonging to House Democrats remain empty during a session convocation in the State Capitol, Tuesday, Aug. But President Donald Trump's call for Texas to blatantly redraw the maps to better ensure that Republicans retain control of the House in the 2026 elections has blown the lid off of the practice. In response to events in Texas, Democrats in California are considering a draft proposal to reshape their own district maps and cut away five Republican seats while securing more precarious seats already held by Democrats. Kathy Hochul said if Texas proceeds, “we must do the same.” The proposal, however, would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the legislature twice and be approved by voters. The House Majority leader, David Moon, a Democrat, says he will sponsor legislation to trigger redistricting in Maryland if Texas or any other state holds redistricting ahead of the census. Ron DeSantis has said he was considering early redistricting and “working through what that would look like.” That's because a law in the Republican-led state requires it before the 2026 midterm elections. ____ Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, New York, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri, Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before walking across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Aug. (AP) — An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year. It was not clear what basis exists to contend that Smith's investigations were political in nature or that he violated the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, had earlier this week encouraged the office to scrutinize Smith's activities and had alleged that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president Kamala Harris, both Democrats. Smith brought two cases against Trump, one accusing him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the other of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both were brought in 2023, well over a year before the 2024 presidential election, and indictments in the two cases cited what Smith and his team described as clear violations of well-established federal law. There was no immediate indication that the same office investigating Smith had opened investigations into the Justice Department special counsels who were appointed by Garland to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Trump selected as his replacement Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host who has praised criminally charged influencer Andrew Tate as a “extraordinary human being” and promoted the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged.

Greg Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court, which is entirely controlled by GOP justices, to remove the Democratic House leader from office through an untested legal argument that the absent legislators have effectively forfeited their seats. In 2021, the Texas Supreme Court held that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year in a similar quorum break. 20, Abbott has the authority to keep calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for 30-day special sessions to pass the redistricting bill and any other item he believes should be addressed.

If only people here eat it, it’s going to be a lot of acai, right?” Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. “If there’s too much acai here, people won’t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.” A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. “We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.” Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023.

Article: colleges College endowment tax is leading to hiring freezes and could mean cuts in financial aid A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes. The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.” The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.” For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.

Article: The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months The entrance to a Boar's Head deli meat plant is seen in New Castle, Ind., Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar’s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. “The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,” officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday. And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar’s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. “If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize" for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.” But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. “You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. Rosa DeLauro called the findings “appalling.” “This is a pattern of negligence — cutting corners to protect the company’s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including “5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.” Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.

Article: NEW YORK -- Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring — and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters. After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas. I want to buy a place, but I’m not going to do that until I’m living there and spend more time in different communities.” According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions. “The one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don’t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,” Barnett said. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities. Every place has trade-offs." If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Learning the grocery store, getting new cellphones, those are just procedural things, but being away from family — that’s the hardest part.” Sarah Friedell O’Connell, a retirement coach in Boston, looks at relocation this way: “You’re going to get a lot of hours back when you stop your full-time job. What are you going to do with that time?" As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona’s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.” He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators — such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family — and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels. Harmer's rule of thumb: When 80 % of your desired daily routine is achievable in a new location for at least 80 % of the year, you’re in the right ZIP code.

Article: “But after around 27,000 people visited the site one of my friends said to me, ‘You should do something more with this.’” Published in 2024, the resulting book-length edition of “Stephen King's Maine” is among hundreds released each year by The History Press. The mission of The History Press is to explore and unearth “the story of America, one town or community at a time.” The King book stands out if only for its focus on an international celebrity. Williams is a self-described “Western history writer” whose books include “Buffalo Soldiers on the Colorado Frontier” and “Haunted Hotels of Southern Colorado.” The History Press publishes highly specific works such as Jerry Harrington's tribute to a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor from the 1930s, “Crusading Iowa Journalist Verne Marshall.” It also issues various series, notably “Haunted” guides that publishing director Kate Jenkins calls a “highly localized version” of the ghost story genre. History Press has long recruited potential authors through a team of field representatives, but now writers such as Kitchens are as likely to be brought to the publisher's attention through a national network of writers who have worked with it before. “Our ideal author isn’t someone with national reach,” Jenkins says, “but someone who’s a member of their community, whether that’s an ethnic community or a local community, and is passionate about preserving that community’s history. Editions selling 15,000 copies or more include “Long-Ago Stories of the Eastern Cherokee,” by Lloyd Arneach, Alphonso Brown's “A Gullah Guide to Charleston” and Gayle Soucek's “Marshall Field's,” a tribute to the Chicago department store. The King guide, which has sold around 8,500 copies so far, received an unexpected lift — an endorsement by its subject, who was shown the book at Maine's Bridgton Books and posted an Instagram of himself giving it a thumbs-up. “Every choice I made while writing the book, I made with him in mind.” History Press authors say they like the chance to tell stories that they believe haven’t been heard, or were told incorrectly. Rory O'Neill Schmitt is an Arizona-based researcher, lecturer and writer who feels her native New Orleans is often “portrayed in way that feels false or highlights a touristy element,” like a “caricature.” She has responded with such books as “The Haunted Guide to New Orleans” and “Kate Chopin in New Orleans.” Brianne Turczynski is a freelance writer and self-described “perpetual seeker of the human condition” who lives outside of Detroit and has an acknowledged obsession with “Poletown,” a Polish ethnic community uprooted and dismantled in the 1980s after General Motors decided to build a new plant there and successfully asserted eminent domain. In 2021, The History Press released Turczynski's “Detroit’s Lost Poletown: The Little Neighborhood That Touched a Nation.” “All of the journalist work that followed the story seemed to lack a sense of closure for the people who suffered,” she said. “So my book is a love letter to that community, an attempt for closure.” Kitchens has followed her King book with the story of an unsolved homicide, “The Murder of Dorothy Milliken, Cold Case in Maine.” One of her early boosters, Michelle Souliere, is the owner of the Green Hand Bookstore in Portland and herself a History Press writer.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

(AP Photo, File) FILE - In this image taken from video, President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touadera arrives at a polling station in Bangui, Central African Republic, Sunday, July 30, 2023. (AP Photo, File) BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow's state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic's government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow's demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). "Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Article: Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries. Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program “broken” and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of “inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Kennedy didn’t specify the changes he's seeking. In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program “has taken a hard line” against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to “a nondependent, adult son," according to his financial disclosures. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children’s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm — perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned — and add the condition to the program. The group’s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son’s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,” Jonathan Gold, Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.

Article: imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade New US tariffs cloud outlook for exporters in Asia and beyond BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump’s new tariff rates on U.S. They are a revised version of what Trump called " reciprocal tariffs," announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan. Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on “flexible work” — the gig economy — for their livelihoods, the government estimates. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment. The slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week.

Claire's Chapter 11 filing follows the bankruptcies of other teen retailers including Forever 21, which filed in March for bankruptcy protection for a second time and eventually closed down its U.S. Claire's, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois and founded in 1974, said that its stores in North America will remain open and will continue to serve customers, while it explores all strategic alternatives. “Increased competition, consumer spending trends and the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail, in combination with our current debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, necessitate this course of action for Claire’s and its stakeholders.” Like many retailers, Claire's was also struggling with higher costs tied to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, analysts said. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, noted in a note published Wednesday Claire's bankruptcy filing comes as “no real surprise.” “The chain has been swamped by a cocktail of problems, both internal and external, that made it impossible to stay afloat,” he wrote.

Article: More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.” A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms" that pits ratepayer classes against one another. Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather. The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share. Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant. Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.” PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power. The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever. Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed. But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs "will be a challenge.” In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. These producers "probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio opens a liquid nitrogen freezer used to store blood samples used for research at the university's T.H. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration. You're being cut off.'” The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus," the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. "It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day." John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said.

Article: It also leads to false alarms — and arrests Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. When a friend asked what she was planning for Thursday, she wrote: “on Thursday we kill all the Mexico’s.” Mathis said the comments were “wrong” and “stupid,” but context showed they were not a threat. “And it was this stupid, stupid technology that is just going through picking up random words and not looking at context.” Surveillance systems in American schools increasingly monitor everything students write on school accounts and devices. The 13-year-old girl arrested in August 2023 had been texting with friends on a chat function tied to her school email at Fairview Middle School, which uses Gaggle to monitor students' accounts. The school district did not respond to a request for comment.) Taken to jail, the teen was interrogated and strip-searched, and her parents weren't allowed to talk to her until the next day, according to a lawsuit they filed against the school system. Amy Bennett, chief of staff for Lightspeed Systems, said that the software helps understaffed schools “be proactive rather than punitive” by identifying early warning signs of bullying, self-harm, violence or abuse. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others. “A really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience — not something that helps them with their mental health care,” said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues — including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students’ Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. Natasha Torkzaban, who graduated in 2024, said she was flagged for editing a friend’s college essay because it had the words “mental health.” “I think ideally we wouldn’t stick a new and shiny solution of AI on a deep-rooted issue of teenage mental health and the suicide rates in America, but that’s where we’re at right now,” Torkzaban said. She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.

(AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.) BEIJING -- A high-tech district in the Chinese capital is opening an all-service robot store on Friday to push a national drive to develop humanoid robots. “With the mass production of humanoid robots, we believe that both enterprises and customers will face pain points,” said Wang Yifan, the director of the Robot Mall in Beijing E-Town, about 40 minutes southeast of downtown by car. Besides those performing tasks, the robots on display include ones that play soccer or Chinese chess, as well as historical figures from scientists Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton to Li Bai, considered one of China's greatest poets.

Article: For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it “easy prey for pedophiles.” Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that “no system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.” The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though — as with most moderation rules — people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards. It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission — and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them. "But when you’re thinking about things related to child endangerment or grooming, the types of behaviors you’re looking at manifest over a very long period of time.” Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox — about 6 billion messages per day — and analyzes them for potential harms. “It doesn’t happen on one message because you just send one message, but it happens because of all of your days' interactions are leading towards one of these two,” Koneru said. “Then we say, okay, maybe this user is somebody who we need to take a much closer look at, and then we go pull all of their other conversations, other friends, and the games that they played, and all of those things.” Humans review risky interactions and flag to law enforcement accordingly.

A sphere is a “perfect shape” because water pressure is exerted equally on all areas, said Chris Roman, a professor at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography. Titan had made more than two dozen deep-sea dives, which put repeated stress on the hull, said Jasper Graham-Jones, an associate professor of mechanical and marine engineering at the University of Plymouth in the United Kingdom. Arun Bansil, a Northeastern University physics professor, likened the pressure to the force of a "whale biting on somebody.” “The passengers probably would have had no idea what happened,” Bansil said in 2023. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British adventurer Hamish Harding and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

(Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute via AP) WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic. The findings “solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean," said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study. Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study. “It’s incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,” said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was “really smart and significant.” Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. “They’re voracious eaters.” With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population – and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations -- and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to “the rainforests of the ocean.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File) FILE - In this long exposure photo, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a payload of Starlink V2 Mini internet satellites lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., late Sunday, July 23, 2023. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays.

Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

(AP Photo/Louise Delmotte) HIROSHIMA, Japan -- When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Ari Beser’s grandfather was on board both of the American B-29 bombers that carried the weapons. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers’ linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States. During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences. When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: “I wouldn’t say it was our proudest moment.” He said the world needed to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Beser, who was in the back of the aircraft working as a radar specialist, said that all he saw out of the window was a “boiling muddy mess with fires continuing to break out on the periphery.” Three days later, he was in another bomber, Bockscar, above Yamaguchi's hometown. “For me, all I focus on is trying to convey it to people so that it doesn’t happen again." Because his grandfather was on both B-29s, Ari Beser was always interested in meeting a double survivor. Everybody needs hope and this is how I get hope." ___ This story has been corrected to show that the the spelling of the second bomber is Bockscar, not Bochscar.

Article: The Department of Health and Human Services plans to cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. speaks as President Donald Trump listens at an event to promote his proposal to improve Americans' access to their medical records in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Article: An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started Anti-death penalty demonstrators gather outside Riverbend Maximum Security Institution before the execution of Byron Black Tuesday, Aug. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was “hurting so bad” while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered. Asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it's hurting so bad," Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm. “Today, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could," attorney Kelley Henry said. “The fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,” Henry said. Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

Article: The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

Article: (Seth Pincus, Elizabeth Fischer, Austin Athman/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH via AP, File) LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission. In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is “highly effective” and “considered to be of major public health interest.” Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. UNAIDS chief Byanyima has previously suggested that President Donald Trump make a deal with Gilead to produce and license its “magical” prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.

Article: DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car. The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards. Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon. The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035. But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. “With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement. Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits. Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.” It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years.

Article: West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class In this image from video, a student eats a meatball sub sandwich during lunch in Parkersburg, W.Va., on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. “Where do we start?” Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, “but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.” More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects. Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. “In rural West Virginia, I don’t think it’s really on radar screens.” In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was “really good.” Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: “Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Article: Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful “forever chemicals” years before the federal government acted. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan — among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases. The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state’s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said. John Lindley, president and CEO of the industry group Michigan Manufactured Housing Association, said the rarity of such cases is evidence that state and local law enforcement are choosing not to enforce the rules. And what we’ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they’ve elected not to.” Mobile home parks without a license are “essentially operating unregulated,” Cherry said. A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 — new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though “the problem is, I’m not resourced for that.” The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year’s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable.

(AP Photo/Emily Elconin) Trinity Wilson, 12, holds her five-month-old cousin, Jaylen, as she and her family walk around the Flint Rx Kids Baby Parade event on July 25, 2025 in on Applewood Campus in Flint, Michigan. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played. It was called a “baby parade.” The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump’s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate. Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up. “They are helping us prove that this is possible.” Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. “And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.” A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate. But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care — not just the number of babies being born here. “No wonder people aren’t having children and our birth rates are going down.” The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 “baby bonuses,” a policy similar to Rx Kids.

(AP Photo/Farah Abdi Warsameh, File) KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion — some two-thirds of the continent's population — in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don’t reach that mark, the report said. An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that “contrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa” and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said. According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks — in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance — were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 “hunger hot spots.” That report, by FAO and WFP, mentioned Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories as being of the “highest concern level.” Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen were classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people faced or were projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is “concerning,” driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump. Vinay Prasad “did not want to be a distraction” and was stepping down from his role as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator “to spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday. Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA’s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines. Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder. During Trump’s first term he signed the “ Right to Try ” law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.

Article: A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity. But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges — until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations. Will you marry me?” Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva — whom he met in 2021 — that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity. Any small stimulus — a smell, a breeze, a color — can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv. "It just feels less intense.” A 2014 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Israeli ex-POWs and combat veterans tracked over 35 years had higher mortality rates, chronic illnesses and worse self-rated health — conditions partly tied to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.

The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's “destabilizing decisions." The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy’s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.” Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations.

Article: To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an x-ray, an ultrasound machine, and a bone density scanner -- all owned by the town. "This is important for our community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, "in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important." According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents. Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors -- by 2035. "This is a huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community." In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here. "It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends." Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said. "We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before," he said, "and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on." Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. He was kind of a different kind of physician." Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a 3-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June. Camron Browning, MD, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist. "My goal," he said, "was to be able to come home and serve my hometown." Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice. After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency.

Article: Kennedy Jr.'s statements before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday revealed a concerning lack of knowledge about the major health programs he'd oversee, should he be confirmed as HHS secretary. The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are narrow." In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income. Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program." He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues -- who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is "fully paid for by the federal government," when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees. Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be "rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges." "He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with," Benjamin said. Also, "he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true." Benjamin was asked -- given the number of Kennedy's misstatements -- whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles. [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does." Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite a few instances of disinformation." Multiple times, he suggested "that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll." Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, "Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID." Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations -- which he now denies -- raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.

Article: A western New York health insurance provider for seniors and the CEO of its medical analytics arm have agreed to pay a total of up to $100 million to settle Justice Department allegations of fraudulent billing for health conditions that were exaggerated or didn't exist. "Today's result sends a clear message to the Medicare Advantage community that the United States will take appropriate action against those who knowingly submit inflated claims for reimbursement," Michael Granston, a Department of Justice (DOJ) deputy assistant attorney general, said in announcing the settlement on December 20. This settlement is not an admission of any wrongdoing; it instead allows us to avoid the further disruption, expense, and uncertainty of litigation in a matter that has lingered for over a decade." Under the settlement, Independent Health will make "guaranteed payments" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement "historic," saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. Ross said that CMS "created a bounty" for health plans that added medical diagnosis codes as they reviewed patients' charts -- and whether those codes were accurate or not "didn't seem to bother some people." "Billions of dollars are being paid out by CMS for diagnoses that don't exist," Ross told KFF Health News in an interview. DxID specialized in mining electronic medical records to capture new diagnoses for patients -- pocketing up to 20% of the money it generated for the health plan, according to the suit, which said Independent Health used the firm from 2010 through 2017. "There is no upfront fee, we don't get paid until you get paid and we work on a percentage of the actual proven recoveries," Gaffney said, according to the complaint. The settlement simply resolves a dispute and provides closure to the parties." 'A Ton of Money' CMS uses a complex formula that pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients and less for people in good health. Independent Health violated those rules by billing Medicare for a range of medical conditions that either were exaggerated or not supported by patient medical files, such as billing for treating chronic depression that had been resolved, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Gaffney said renal failure diagnoses were "worth a ton of money to IH [Independent Health] and the majority of people (over) 70 have it at some level." Ross filed the whistleblower case in 2012 against Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, one of the nation's oldest managed-care groups. Ross, a former medical coding manager there, alleged that DxID submitted more than $30 million in disease claims -- many of which were not valid -- on behalf of Group Health for 2010 and 2011. For instance, Ross alleged that the plan billed for "major depression" in a patient described by his doctor as having an "amazingly sunny disposition." Group Health, now known as the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, denied wrongdoing. Ross, 60, said she is now "happily retired." False Claims Whistleblowers sue under the False Claims Act, a federal law dating to the Civil War that allows private citizens to expose fraud against the government and share in any recovery. At least two dozen such suits, some dating to 2009, have targeted Medicare Advantage plans for overstating the severity of medical conditions, a practice known in the industry as "upcoding." Previous settlements from such suits have totaled more than $600 million. In a surprise action in late January 2023, CMS announced that it would settle for a fraction of the estimated tens of millions of dollars in overpayments uncovered through its audits dating to 2011 and not impose major financial penalties on health plans until a round of audits for 2018 payments, which have yet to be done.

Article: A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died 'Chimp Crazy' star sentenced to nearly 4 years in prison for lying that primate died A Missouri woman who starred in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy” has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison after she lied that a movie star primate that she was accused of mistreating had died. It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in “confined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures” at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility. Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies “Buddy” and “George of the Jungle.” Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie “Buddy” alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2022 that she lied to protect Tonka from “the evil clutches of PETA.” She also admitted what happened in the third episode of “Chimp Crazy,” which premiered last year, saying, “Tonka was literally on the run with me.” Just last month, investigators found another chimp locked up in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach in violation of court orders, documents in the case said. "In the face of these harsh realities threaded throughout her life, Haddix came to form secure attachments with animals.” PETA praised the sentence in a news release, saying that Haddix now “can't hurt another chimpanzee.”

Article: As Starz's historical drama series “Outlander” readies its final season for a premiere next year, fans can now learn about where Jamie and Claire Fraser came from in the new prequel series, “Outlander: Blood of My Blood.” 'Outlander' prequel series 'Blood of My Blood' goes back in time again — to meet the parents Hermione Corfield poses for a portrait to promote "Outlander: Blood of My Blood" during Comic-Con International on Saturday, July 26, 2025, in San Diego. In “Outlander,” "there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that’s what our audience wants from the books.” In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in “breadcrumbs” said Roberts. “We stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.” The big obstacle facing Jamie’s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland — is that they come from families that “don’t get on,” said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. My father’s worst enemy was Brian’s father so I’m sure he’d have had some strong words to say about the whole thing.” Jamie Roy, who plays Brian, enjoys the duality of his character. There's the “tough, stoic, Highland warrior” who he says “rides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.” Then there's this “lovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.” A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of “Outlander,” because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son. “I think he’s accepted death really and doesn’t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.” Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. They end up in the 1700s where Irvine explains they are “trying to live second by second.” "The time they’ve gone back to is not a friendly time to be an outsider at all. They survive by the skin of their teeth.” The cast is already in production on season two of “Blood of My Blood.” Hermione Corfield, who plays Julia, says it's been nice filming “in our own little secret bubble.” Promoting the series has been tricky because they have to remember what happened in season one versus season two.

Article: The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn’s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically Gwen Davis sings at Berean Baptist Church in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York, Thursday, July 31, 2025. (Fiona Murphy/Religion News Service via AP) NEW YORK (RNS) — On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand‑claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard “God Is” on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as “joy in sorrow” and “strength for tomorrow.” Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.' As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,” said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she’s been a congregant for six years. “I really feel sometimes like it’s not just me singing, it’s my lineage singing.” ___ This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center. Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today. “I don’t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.” According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% — the largest decline among major U.S. Glenn McMillan, Concord’s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish. “In the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,” McMillan said. According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in‑person worship. “People don’t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.” McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid‑1960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song. A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.” During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods. Augustine said singing is praying twice.” Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. “We only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, no — we can’t let this happen.’” Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. "When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,” Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. “At the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other’s pain and celebrate each other’s joys.” McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. “A choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.” Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.

Article: Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre” at the Santa Fe Opera House This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. (Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

(Vertical Entertainment via AP) Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. But it’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work. It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I’ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she’s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto). Miller’s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest “Dame Of Darkness” is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. There’s lots of fretting over why Katherine won’t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. But coherency of the vision is limited, as is the audience’s investment, though there are some lovely and inspired touches like using Iranian artist Reza Riahi to hand paint several animated flashback vignettes based on her memories of her fathers. Thomas co-wrote the script with her husband, journalist John Micklethwait, which includes a particularly poignant monologue for her character telling her daughters, essentially, to grow up and move on — a mature and worthy statement that might come a bit too late. But Thomas did have the good sense to end with a song that might just conjure up some feelings for any “Heartburn” fans out there: Carly Simon’s “Coming Around Again,” this time a duet with Alanis Morissette.

Article: Eddie Palmieri, the pioneering rumba and Latin jazz musician, has died at 88 Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. Palmieri’s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after “an extended illness.” The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle’s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums. His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album “The Sun of Latin Music,” and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams. In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: “Learning to play the piano well. Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of “Harlem River Drive,” in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production “Llegó La India vía Eddie Palmieri.” Palmieri released the album “Masterpiece” in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

Article: Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, “Weapons," and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor Josh Brolin arrives at the premiere of "Weapons" on Thursday, July 31, 2025, at The United Theater on Broadway in Los Angeles. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) LOS ANGELES -- If there’s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie “Weapons,” it’s that the best laughs won’t come from the jokes he writes. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious — a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie’s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are “opposite side of the same coin.” “It’s funny because this isn’t even like a proper horror film,” Garner said. “It has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it’s kind of its own genre, in a way.” The town’s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Yet, when Garner’s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage. “We definitely have a, ‘Whoa, not my problem,’ kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we’re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it’s happening in front of us,” Cregger said. “Living in America, I’ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I’ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don’t know, it feels real.” Brolin — who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, “The Goonies,” to the Marvel universe — initially hesitated when approached for the film. How do you deal?” For Ehrenreich, who’s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, “Weapons” offered a different pace, but its horror wasn’t what drew him in. “The weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I’ve read in years,” Ehrenreich said.

Article: A federal judge in Oregon has issued an injunction temporarily stopping the mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities grants to humanities councils around the country President Donald Trump pauses while speaking during an announcement about Apple with Apple CEO Tim Cook in the Oval Office, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Oregon issued an injunction Wednesday temporarily stopping the mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities grants to humanities councils around the country, saying the cancellations were likely unconstitutional. Simon, an appointee of President Barack Obama, issued a temporary stay on action taken in April by the National Endowment for the Humanities, saying the claims made by plaintiffs in the case were “likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this case is unconstitutional.” Defendants’ conduct reflects a “deliberate decision to flout Congressional command and refuse to spend appropriated funds,” the opinion said, noting, “The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.” The Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled dozens of grants to state and local humanities' councils in April as part of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts. This is one step — among many that are needed — in the large, ongoing endeavor to knit our communities and the country closer together.” The National Endowment for the Humanities did not immediately answer a phone call or email for comment. Simon said in issuing the stay that the record contained “unrebutted evidence of irreparable harms," noting that “when these programs are cancelled, there can be no do over and no redress.“ The judge rejected a request by the NEH that the injunction be stayed. Simon said the defendants were “likely violating statutory obligations and principles of separation of powers that have existed for decades.” The order also stopped the government from “disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs.”

Article: The chief weakness of “Freakier Friday” — which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion — is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

(Marvel/Disney via AP) LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marvel's first family stumbled in theaters in its second weekend, but still held on to the top spot at the box office. “It’s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.” Newcomer comedy “The Bad Guys 2” earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall." James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. "It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost.

The 42-year-old Sangha, who prosecutors say was known to her customers as “The Ketamine Queen,” is charged with five counts of ketamine distribution, including one count of distribution resulting in death. But prosecutors say when the doctor wouldn't give Perry as much as he wanted, he illegally sought more from Plasencia, then still more from Sangha, who they say presented herself as "a celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods.” Perry's assistant and friend said in their plea agreements that they acted as middlemen to buy large amounts of ketamine for Perry from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash a few days before his death.

The museum disputes it FILE - Mick Jagger, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones perform before a crowd of nearly 250,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, on July 5, 1969, during a five hour concert. (AP Photo/Peter Kemp, File) FILE - Mick Jagger, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones perform before a crowd of nearly 250,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, on July 5, 1969, during a five hour concert. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next.

Article: Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, “Different Night Same Rodeo.” “I don't know what I'm doing,” Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. “I just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I’m trying to write other songs that have already been written.” So, he took a step back, and asked himself: “What am I trying to do with my music? “So just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I’ve been through.” On “Different Night Same Rodeo,” those stories are told in big-hearted ballads (“Hell or High Water”), good time stomps (“New to Country”) and varied collaborations, including with country star Luke Combs (“Backup Plan”), the rising pop voice the Kid LAROI (“Lost”), and Diplo (“Ashes”). He's always been open to such eclectic collaborations, anchored in his raspy, charismatic tone — Zimmerman's highest charting song to date is “All The Way,” a hip-hop-country hybrid he features on with rapper BigXThaPlug. “And I want it to feel real, because it comes across not real when it’s not.” For an artist who describes himself as “dealing with a little bit of impostor syndrome,” he seems to know, at least intuitively, what works for himself and his fans.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File) LOS ANGELES -- Loni Anderson, who played a struggling radio station’s empowered receptionist on the hit TV comedy “WKRP in Cincinnati,” died Sunday, just days before her 80th birthday. Anderson starred on the big screen alongside Burt Reynold s in the 1983 comedy “Stroker Ace,” and the two later married and became tabloid fixtures before their messy breakup in 1994. Their son, Quinton Reynolds, was “the best decision that we ever made in our entire relationship,” she said during the unveiling of a bronze bust at Reynolds’ Hollywood grave site in 2021. Anderson detailed their tumultuous marriage in the 1995 autobiography, “My Life in High Heels,” which she said was about “the growth of a woman, a woman who survives." “I think if you’re going to write about yourself, you have to do it warts and all,” Anderson told the AP while promoting the book. Most of her career was spent on the small screen with early guest parts in the 1970s on “S.W.A.T.” and “Police Woman.” After “WKRP,” Anderson starred in the short-lived comedy series “Easy Street” and appeared in made-for-TV movies including “A Letter to Three Wives” and “White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd.” In 2023 she co-starred in Lifetime’s “Ladies Of The 80s: A Divas Christmas” with Linda Gray, Donna Mills, Morgan Fairchild and Nicollette Sheridan. I’m just devastated to hear this." Anderson is survived by Flick, her daughter Deidra and son-in law Charlie Hoffman, son Quinton Anderson Reynolds, grandchildren McKenzie and Megan Hoffman, stepson Adam Flick and wife Helene, and step-grandchildren Felix and Maximilian.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) — Comic-Con got a lot of Ryan and a little bit of Rocky at a panel on “Project: Hail Mary,” the forthcoming film that's equal parts space adventure, real-science deep-dive, broad comedy and relationship drama. “If the universe depended on it,” Miller said, “can adult men make friends?” Rocky is already a cult favorite for readers of Andy Weir’s novel, and is sure to be a future staple of Comic-Con cosplay. Weir, who was part of the panel, chimed in: “From Emma Stone, to person of stone.” The film is adapted by screenwriter Drew Goddard, who also wrote the script for the 2015 Matt Damon movie “The Martian,” based on Weir's first novel. Gosling said he got on board the ship immediately after reading “Project Hail Mary” in manuscript form, and was only partly kidding when he called Weir, who was sitting next to him, “the greatest sci-fi mind of our time.” “I knew it would be brilliant, because it’s Andy, but nothing could prepare me,” Gosling said. “It took me places I’d never been, it showed me things I’d never seen, it was as heartbreaking as it was funny.” Gosling plays Ryland Grace, a middle school teacher and underachiever drafted for the mission. He gives a mealymouthed scream of “Where am ?!” When the lights came up in the room, Gosling said that he'd looked in the scene like a “space caveman” in a “placenta onesie.” The movie represents the return to directing, and return to space, of Lord and Miller for the first time since they were fired and replaced by Ron Howard by Disney and Lucasfilm from 2018’s “Solo.” Like, “The Martian,” the movie goes heavy on the science — Weir, also a producer, said he spent hours going over every equation one very white board.

(Netflix via AP) This image released by Netflix shows characters, from left, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira in a scene from "KPop Demon Hunters." (Netflix via AP) NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of “KPop Demon Hunters,” everyone is a fan. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 — empowered girl groups used as references for the film’s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X. They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys’ hit song “Soda Pop,” for example, references the ’90s K-pop group H.O.T. She considers “Kpop Demon Hunters” to be “a musical with songs inspired by K-pop,” not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for “Mamma Mia.” The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. “If you don’t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.” Zabrinah Santiago, a San Diego-based longtime K-pop fan and freelance illustrator who goes by ItmeZ online, was so inspired by the animation style of the movie that she raced to make fan art. She sold illustrated fan cards of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys at her booth at the Los Angeles Anime Expo, held in July, two weeks after the movie was released on Netflix. Kang says for “KPop Demon Hunters,” her team wanted to bring together demons and Jeoseung Saja — the grim reaper in Korean mythology — for a film that could look both very traditional and modernized — what she says is common in K-dramas but not in animation. “It’s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.” Santiago was initially skeptical of the title “KPop Demon Hunters.” “I feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. “But I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.” Indeed — if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin.

Article: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defiantly declared Saturday that his countrymen "will not give their land to occupiers," after President Donald Trump suggested that a peace deal would include some "swapping" of territories with Russia. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." His comments came after Trump announced on Truth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska. we'll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever." A White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire for the war in Ukraine, and the U.S. But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were "decisions against peace," adding, "They will not achieve anything." The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday. The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage.

Employer adoption is key First of all, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (better known as ERISA), major changes to investment menus require thoughtful guidance and buy-in from plan sponsors – especially if they involve volatile and still-maturing asset classes like crypto, Boneparth noted. "There should be oversight on that from the investment committee or plan sponsor overseeing what digital currencies actually get accepted and should for sure be educating on it." "There's potential upside in digital currencies, but a lot of folks can't understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns – and it could be destructive," he added.

Article: The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it is proposing to extend flight cuts at Newark, one of the three main airports serving the New York City-area, through October 2026 as it continues to face air traffic controller shortage and congestion issues. In May, the FAA ordered flight cuts at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport through the end of 2025 following a series of major disruptions at the United Airlines hub that snarled hundreds of flights and sparked alarm about the aging U.S. The FAA said on Friday the goal of the reduced flight rates is to "continue maintaining safety while alleviating flight delays due to staffing and equipment challenges, resulting in smoother travel into and out of Newark." Last month, the Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said it would investigate the FAA's 2024 decision to relocate some Newark air traffic controllers to Philadelphia from New York to address staffing shortages and congested New York City-area airspace. The FAA said "persistent low staffing levels and low training success rate" at N90 were among the reasons to move control of the Newark airspace in a bid to boost staffing levels and help ease congestion.

Article: Scott Mlyn | CNBC Shares of The Trade Desk plummeted 39% on Friday, their worst day on record, after the ad-tech company announced the departure of its CFO and analysts expressed concerns about rising competition from Amazon . The Trade Desk, which specializes in providing technology to companies that want to target users across the web, said finance chief Laura Schenkein is leaving the job and being replaced by Alex Kayyal, who has been working as a partner at Lightspeed Ventures. While some analysts were uneasy about the sudden change in the top finance role, the bigger concern is Amazon's growing role in the online ad market, as well as the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on ad spending. "Amazon is now unlocking access to traditionally exclusive 'premium' ad inventory across the open internet, validating the strength of its DSP and suggesting The Trade Desk's value proposition could erode over time," Wedbush analysts wrote on Friday. The Wedbush analysts lowered their rating on The Trade Desk to the equivalent of hold from buy, and cited Amazon's recent ad integration with Disney as a sign of the company's aggressiveness. Executives at The Trade Desk were asked about Amazon on the call, and responded by suggesting that the companies don't really compete, emphasizing that Amazon is conflicted because it will always prioritize its own properties. watch now "A scaled independent DSP like The Trade Desk becomes essential as we help advertisers buy across everything and that we have to do that without conflict or compromise," CEO Jeff Green said on the call. That creates a number of conflicts." For the second quarter, The Trade Desk reported a 19% increase in year-over-year revenue to $694 million, topping the $685 million estimate, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Many are managing inflation worries and the related pricing that comes with that." With Friday's slump, The Trade Desk shares are now down 54% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up about 9%.

Article: Stocks including Apple and Alphabet may be among some of Wall Street's most overbought stocks — and could be soon due for a pullback, according to one widely used technical metric. The iPhone maker led this week's rally higher, gaining 13.3% on the week — its biggest weekly gain in more than five years — after announcing it will increase its U.S. "But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge." This announcement was made after Apple's third-quarter earnings and revenue, released July 31, once again topped Wall Street's expectations . Alphabet also said it would increase its 2025 capital investments by $10 billion due to "strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services." On the other hand, this week's most oversold names include Airbnb. While the company posted a second-quarter earnings and revenue beat Thursday afternoon, investors grew concerned about rising competition from Amazon in the online ad market and the departure of CFO Laura Schenkein. "We downgrade TTD to Neutral from Buy as growth is coming in below our expectations and we have less visibility in the near-term growth algorithm," wrote Citi analyst Ygal Arounian.

Article: President Donald Trump 's new executive order paves the way to bring alternative assets into 401(k)s, but what that will eventually look like — and how complicated it may be — remains to be seen. The order, signed by the president on Thursday , directs the Secretary of Labor to reexamine fiduciary guidance on alternative investments — such as private equity, private credit and cryptocurrencies — in 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans. "There's still a very big question if plan sponsors will actually get comfortable enough to make these an option." Some $12.2 trillion was held in defined contributions plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, as of the end of the first quarter, according to the Investment Company Institute . One size doesn't always fit Bonnie Treichel, an attorney who specializes in ERISA, believes it is inevitable that assets such as private equity, private credit, hedge funds, real estate and cryptocurrencies are coming to the defined contribution market. "The plan sponsors' job is to offer an investment lineup that is in the best interest of the plan and its participants, and that meets the needs of those participants," said Treichel, founder of Endeavor Retirement. "It's not a one-size-fits all when it comes to retirement plans." Treichel doesn't see alternative assets becoming available as a standalone investment option in a 401(k), at least just yet. That hedge fund is going to be within a target date fund, so a participant is not necessarily choosing how much they allocate to a hedge fund or private credit." Part of the whole Prime Capital Financial's Jania Stout, president of the firm's retirement and wellness businesses, also anticipates the options are likely to be inside a target date fund, with a small percentage allocated to private markets, or managed accounts. "I don't think we're there yet." Morningstar's Kephart believes that first offering the investments in managed accounts, which investors often have to opt into, will make plan sponsors more comfortable, he said. "It brings the question of — at the end of the day, is it worth it if you have to take all these extra steps to make it fit?" Higher fees Adding exposure to alternative assets could also cost you more money. "What we've seen in private market funds is the incentive fee expense is usually at least as high as the management fee, if not higher." For instance, a lot of index-based target-date funds have expense ratios of 0.10% or lower, he said. If a plan ultimately offers some form of alternative asset allocation and investors aren't interested, they can talk to the advisors associated with the plan about other investment options, Treichel said. And that's what committees have to decide when they're evaluating this at their fiduciary committee meetings." Encouraging guardrails Certified financial planner Chuck Failla, founder of Sovereign Financial Group, thinks 401(k)s should have some type of guardrails in place to ensure those investing in private markets are accredited investors, which means they have a net worth of at least $1 million. "If you don't have a $1 million liquid, you should probably stay away from alts until you have some more liquidity backed up," said Failla, who offers private market access to his mass affluent clients through a fund. For instance, if plan sponsors try to limit the risks that inherently come with investing in the space, it could ultimately affect the investments' returns, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. "One of the reasons that private market' return is so much better is because you get compensated by giving your money away for an extended period of time where you can't get it back," Roth explained.

Article: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call that AI helped imbue "greater efficiency and gains across our ad system," thus contributing to the 22% year-over-year increase of second-quarter sales that hit $47.52 billion. In April, Li noted that Asia-based online retailers pulled back on their digital ad spending amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tough tariffs and the closing of the de minimis trade loophole. This quarter, Li said there's been a noticeable "improvement" with those Asian-based ecommerce firms, which have increased their digital ad spending on the platform along with small, North American-based advertisers. Davidson, said that while there is still broader macroeconomic uncertainty, "today, digital advertising in general, is doing well; It is simply an extension of the fact that the consumer is still strong." "There's optimism that consumer spending will hold up and therefore all the downstream markets will hold up," Luria said. "I think one of the things that its earnings taught us was that you can spend a lot of money on AI when your core business is doing well, and especially when your core business has been already benefiting from the investments that you've made in AI," Jasmine Enberg, a vice president and principal analyst for eMarketer, said about Meta's second quarter. Alphabet added an extra $10 billion to its 2025 forecast for capital expenditures, now pegged at $85 billion, while Meta raised the low end of its capital expenditures for the year to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion instead of $64 billion and $72 billion. "They kind of rose back like a phoenix and had some extraordinary results," Luria said about Reddit, which saw its shares plummet over 15% in February after it reported weaker-than-expected user numbers due to a Google search algorithm change. Snap's second-quarter sales grew only 9% year-over-year and it missed Wall Street's estimates on global average revenue per user, a metric that refers to how much money the company derives from each user. Pinterest finance chief Julia Brau Donnelly told analysts during an earnings call that the company is still noticing some tariff-related concerns, "and broader market uncertainty" as it previously indicated in May. Unlike Meta, Donnelly said that "Asia-based e-commerce retailers pulled back spend in the U.S.," underscoring how some advertisers gravitate toward bigger online ad platforms amid any signs of global economic uncertainty.

Article: Kate Green | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images "Treatonomics" — a consumer trend that covers spending on 'everyday luxuries' to larger, life-affirming experiences — is booming as people look for a mood boost in ongoing unsettling economic times. Spending on small-item 'pick-me-ups' is a well-established recession-resistant trend, with consumers often turning to purchases of modest personal items such as make-up, perfume and candles — or even collectible rubber ducks or Labubu dolls — for a morale boost when times are hard or uncertain. First documented during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the term had a renaissance in the 2000s when Leonard Lauder, former chairman of makeup brand Estée Lauder, noticed a spike in sales after the Sept. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth," he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is "much more resilient than people imagine." SHANGHAI, CHINA: A woman checks out the lipsticks at a department store in Shanghai, 16 August 2004. LIU JIN | AFP | Getty Images The Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have "experiences," particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour. "Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330)," Stevenson said. "This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life," Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times." Smith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for "nearly every living generation" and were being reinvented or disappearing, "out of desire or because they're no longer attainable." That has prompted a shift from being able to celebrate 'milestones' to celebrating more 'inch-stones,' resulting in this rapid rise of treatonomics. "For example — for those who can't afford a home before 40, treating has been a welcome respite and a way to express themselves in their environment when a milestone passes them by," Smith said. Urbazon | E+ | Getty Images On a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has "catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits," Smith added. Consumer confidence underlies the mood In the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued "below last year's heady levels," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week.

Article: "If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC this week that the Supreme Court could end up disqualifying the duties that have been ordered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act enacted by Congress in 1977. "If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy," Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. However, Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a report this week that these levies being struck down would lead to a "massive amount of red tape" around who would receive refunds. Markets this year have appeared to respond positively whenever the White House has dialed back on tariffs, and have reacted negatively when Trump has pressed the case for higher duties on imports to the U.S. For example, when Trump suspended the initial "liberation day" tariffs in early April for the next 90 days, the Nasdaq Composite soared 7% in just a few minutes, with other major market averages also posting large gains that week. Companies such as AMD and Marvell , as well as Apple , then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add manufacturing in the U.S.

Article: President Donald Trump on Friday removed Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Billy Long and is replacing him temporarily with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, three sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. The temporary appointment adds to Bessent's long list of tasks such as managing trade talks with China, Canada and Mexico as well as other countries that are still trying to negotiate tariff rates. Trump has long promised to set up an "external revenue service" for collecting those tariff revenues but the task still falls to the Treasury Department and Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The law extends the expiring tax cuts he enacted in his first term, in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay and allowing deductions on auto loan interest payments. The legislation is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over 10 years and lead to more than 11 million people losing health insurance coverage due to Medicaid cuts and other provisions.

Article: The bankrupt home goods chain is being resurrected by the owners and licensees of its intellectual property, which opened the first new Bed Bath & Beyond store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday with potentially dozens of more to come. This time around, the store has a new name — Bed Bath & Beyond Home — and marks a "fresh start" for the beloved brand, said Amy Sullivan, the CEO of The Brand House Collective , the store's operator. "We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today," Sullivan said in a news release. It's a powerful addition to our portfolio and a meaningful step forward in our transformation." In honor of the brand's legacy, the new store will accept the brand's famous 20% coupon, regardless of when it expired. "The coupon we all know and love is back and for those who need one, a fresh version will be waiting at the door." Bed Bath and Beyond 2.0 has been several years in the making and involved a rigmarole of corporate acquisitions and rebrandings. When the original Bed Bath and Beyond filed for bankruptcy in April 2023 following a string of corporate missteps, it struggled to find a buyer and ended up liquidating and selling off its business in parts. Ultimately, Beyond took an ownership stake in Kirkland's Inc., a home decor chain with around 300 stores across the U.S., and gave it the exclusive license to develop and create Bed Bath & Beyond Home stores, as well as Buy Buy Baby stores. The company said it chose Nashville for the launch because of its proximity to its corporate headquarters, which will allow it to "closely manage every detail and set the standard for future rollouts." While the relaunch is exciting for fans of the legacy brand, it comes at a difficult time for the home decor market. In many ways, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy was the fault of its management team and execution missteps, but it also faced macro challenges as well, experts said at the time. Competition from players like Amazon , Walmart , Home Goods and Wayfair has made it harder for other brands to capture customer spend, and the overall sector has been soft for several years because of high interest rates and the sluggish housing market.

The deal between the South Caucasus rivals - assuming it holds - would be a significant accomplishment for the Trump administration that is sure to rattle Moscow, which sees the region as within its sphere of influence. "It's a long time - 35 years - they fought and now they're friends, and they're going to be friends for a long time," Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House, where he was flanked by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan and India. Senior administration officials told reporters the agreement marked the first end to several frozen conflicts on Russia's periphery since the end of the Cold War and said it would send a powerful signal to the entire region. The peace deal could transform the South Caucasus, an energy-producing region neighboring Russia, Europe, Turkey and Iran that is criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines but riven by closed borders and longstanding ethnic conflicts. Daphne Panayotatos, with the Washington-based rights group Freedom Now, said it has urged the Trump administration to use the meeting with Aliyev to demand the release of some 375 political prisoners held in the country.

On a Thursday call with analysts, CEO Jonathan Neman said Sweetgreen had a "really, really rough quarter."

Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame — thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission — immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell — that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Article: But, four people on the firm's seven-person investment team, including Gropper, have spent considerable time working at Elliott Management: They have experience with shareholder activism and are not afraid to use it. Behind the scenes Viasat operates in two businesses segments: Communications (73% of revenue and 80% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Defense and Advanced Technologies ("DAT") (27% of revenue and 20% of EBITDA). Carronade believes that the reason why this company is trading down is simple: Viasat has been treated by the market as a small-cap legacy satellite company that has been marked for death due to new high-profile entrants like Starlink. It is true that the broadband business is declining, as revenue is down over 27% year over year, but this is only a piece of the Communications business and the worst piece with the lowest margins. The Communications segment also has three other businesses: (i) Government, which is growing approximately 25% year over year; (ii) IFC, with 22% growth; and (iii) Maritime, which is growing at 11%. And this is a very nascent market with only approximately one third of airplanes globally having Wi-Fi, so there is a huge untapped market, which Viasat should get a large piece of despite competition from Starlink and other competitors. DAT is a hidden gem, with best-in-class EBITDA margins of 28%, double-digit revenue growth, and significant exposure to hot button next-generation defense and dual-use technologies such as the Golden Dome, next-generation encryption, drones, device-to-device (D2D) and low Earth orbit. While Carronade highlights how each of these translates into promising growth avenues, perhaps the best illustration of DAT's mis-valuation lies in its D2D platform services, which is designed to enable global connectivity directly to unmodified smartphones and other Internet of Things devices. The peer comps to DAT – companies like AeroVironment, Kratos, Mercury Systems and Redwire all have lower margins and weaker growth profiles, yet trade at multiples ranging between the mid-20s to above 80-times EBITDA. Carronade's proposed solution is simple but compelling: spin-off or IPO the DAT business to unlock this intrinsic value and eliminate the drag caused by the narratives orbiting the satellite business. Carronade models 20-times to 51-times (comp median) valuations for this business giving it a value of $6.3 billion to $16.2 billion, versus a present enterprise value for the entire company of approximately $8 billion. Applying a conservative 4-times value to this business creates another $4.9 billion of value, and there is another $1 billion of value from the upfront and long-term annual payments pursuant to a recent legal settlement with Ligado Networks. Viasat is highly levered, and its investment base is filled with creditors, so we imagine Carronade likely entered its position (currently approximately 2.6% of shares outstanding) in a similar fashion. The firm's analysis almost seems too good to be true, but there is not a lot of focus on small-cap companies in today's market and this lack of focus is exacerbated when you have companies like Starlink greatly winning the PR battle against companies like Viasat. This is how a company can go from $34 per share to $16 per share (prior to Carronade's engagement) over two years despite revenue increasing from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion and EBITDA growing from $344 million to $1.4 billion. While Carronade is not known for confrontational activism, that is OK, because this is a situation where no more than a nudge should be needed and Carronade's best weapon is the power of the argument. Moreover, management has already signaled that they have been considering selling some of the DAT business, suggesting that they may already recognize Carronade's value proposition and are headed in the right direction. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

Article: England Lioness and Gotham FC defender Jess Carter said social media companies can do more to police hate comments online after she faced racial abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament. Carter, a defender for the American soccer team Gotham FC, is part of the England women's national team, nicknamed the "Lionesses," that just secured a historic win in the Euro 2025 championships after defeating Spain on penalties in the final in Switzerland in July. Carter had to take a step back from social media after facing intense racial abuse during the tournament and in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer, she shared how she's dealing with the online attacks. "I'm not someone who normally takes myself off social media, because I'm used to the critics and used to getting some of the abuse that we get as athletes and people in the public eye, as it happens a lot," Carter told Bryer. "So this time around, I think the way that I dealt with it was just to completely take myself off social media so that I wasn't able to see anything that was said and I could just focus on what was being said within my camp," she added. The England women's team came out in support of Carter after the abuse and decided not to take the knee — an anti-racism gesture — before the Euro 2025 matches, saying it is "clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism."

Article: President Donald Trump's latest tariffs, a sharp departure from the steep selloff triggered by his April 2 announcement of "reciprocal" duties, as investors grow increasingly numb to what they see as a negotiating tactic. India, targeted in part over its continued purchases of Russian oil, saw its tariffs jump from an earlier 25% to 50% on Wednesday on a broad range of goods . I think there's also a lot of precedent in terms of things being announced and then rolled back later," said Steve Brice, global chief investment officer at Standard Chartered Bank's wealth solutions unit. Investors' indifference towards Trump's tariff threats recalls a term for his pattern of announcing hefty tariff threats that jolt markets, only to scale them back or delay them, which was coined as "Trump Always Chickens Out" — or TACO . The markets bought into Trump's rhetoric in April when he said that his initial tariff positions were his final offer, which explains why equity markets fell heavily, said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds. "I think the markets are becoming a bit numb to the permanent volatility on these issues," he said, adding that markets attempted to price these in back in April and May, but pauses and repeated negotiations since then have made the markets "incapable of pricing it in any concrete manner." "The market is just not capable of pricing it in because of the chronic uncertainty," he said. On Wednesday, Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States." "Building a plant may cost hundreds of millions.

Article: In this article .FKRX300 Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Ryu Young-sang, CEO of South Korean telecoms giant SK Telecom, told CNBC that AI is helping telecoms firms improve efficiency in their networks. Manaure Quintero | Afp | Getty Images South Korea has tasked some of its biggest companies and promising startups to build a national foundational AI model using mainly domestic technology, in a rare move to keep the country apace with the U.S. The project will feature South Korean technologies from semiconductors to software, as Seoul looks to create a near self-sufficient AI industry and position itself as an alternative to China and the U.S. "The country aims to combine its dominance in memory chip production with the development of indigenous AI." The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) for Korea announced that five consortia have been selected to develop the models. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness," Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC. "This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents," The Futurum Group's Patience said. Meanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon . The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called "A." which is pronounced "A dot." Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot. Any AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek. "Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic," Kim told CNBC. An open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.

Article: David Mcnew | Getty Images News | Getty Images Top insurers fear the climate crisis could soon outpace industry solutions, effectively threatening to make entire regions around the world uninsurable. Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz , one of the world's biggest insurers, recently outlined how the world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for financial services, such as mortgages and investments. In a LinkedIn post published in late March, Thallinger made the case for rapid decarbonization, pointing out that entire asset classes were "degrading in real time" as extreme weather events take their toll. Thallinger, who is responsible for investment management and sustainability at Allianz, told CNBC that approximately two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are currently uninsured, indicating a "major societal problem." We are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. "If this volume just grows even more, we simply have a societal situation that is not bearable anymore because it is just too much risk that is no longer covered," Thallinger told CNBC by video call. It's very, very difficult to deal with these assets as an investor." The warning comes at a time when the world is on course for a temperature increase of as much as 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century, according to the United Nations, a level that would trigger "catastrophic" consequences for the planet. Allianz estimates that the cost of economic losses from natural catastrophes is typically around 10 times higher than the cost of adaptation, noting that this provides a clear economic incentive for policymakers to invest in preventative measures. "If we continue, however, with the policies that we have out there, we are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. Zurich Insurance Group , Europe's fifth-largest insurer, said in April alongside a research paper assessing climate resilience that the outlook looks "alarmingly bleak." The Swiss insurer cited the Los Angeles wildfires at the start of the year as a stark reminder that even the world's wealthiest economies are unprepared for the impact of increasing climate risks. On an inflation-adjusted basis, Zurich said that average insured losses rose by 5.9% per year between 1994 and 2023, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.7% annually over the same period. "If insured losses continue to grow at this rate, premiums for climate risk coverage will need to increase to reflect the additional risk," Zurich Insurance Group said in the paper. "This in turn, will affect the level of protection that individuals and businesses are willing and able to purchase, with potential consequences for the overall functioning of the market." CAT bonds For insurers and reinsurers, the increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events has coincided with astronomical growth in the catastrophe bond market. First created in the 1990s, so-called CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, said in a recent report that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down.

Article: government is loathe to admit it, but economists say it's highly likely that the Treasury will have to hike taxes in the fall if it is to bung a black hole in the public finances that it has effectively created for itself. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is the latest economic think tank to warn that taxes would have to rise later this year if British Chancellor Rachel Reeves is to meet her self-imposed "fiscal rules." These rules target both a balanced or budget surplus by the end of the decade — with the so-called "stability rule" requiring that day-to-day spending is funded by tax revenues rather than borrowing — and that debt, as a proportion of GDP, should be falling by the end of this parliament (in 2029-30), aka the "investment rule." "The Government is not on track to meet its 'stability rule', with our forecast suggesting a current deficit of £41.2 billion in the fiscal year 2029-30," NIESR said in an economic outlook released Wednesday. With the government having fixed its spending plans for the next couple of years in its recent Spending Review, "the only lever available is to raise taxation in a moderate but sustained way," the think tank said in the report titled "the Chancellor's Trilemma." The 'trilemma' refers to the bind Reeves finds herself in thanks to her own fiscal rules, tax and spending commitments made over the last year and the Labour Party's manifesto promise to not raise taxes on "working people." "Simply put, the Chancellor cannot simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments, and uphold manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people.

Article: PE firms typically sell their portfolio companies through various exit routes such as trade sales to strategic buyers, secondary sales to other PE firms, and public listings via initial public offerings, allowing them to return capital and profits to limited partners (LPs), who are private equity fund investors. Johns Hopkins Carey Business School Jeff Hooke However, PE firms are buying and investing in more companies than they can offload them — which means investors are trapped in aging funds or waiting longer for their returns. The ratio of PE investments to exits has jumped from 2.6x in 2024 to 3.14x in 2025, the highest in a decade, as firms continue to delay sales, recent data from PitchBook showed . Zombie funds The slowdown has a side effect: the rise of "zombie funds" — private equity vehicles that exist but have little hope of fully exiting their investments or raising new capital. It's just sort of sitting there." A growing number of private equity investors are seeing their capital locked in so-called "zombie funds," a 2024 survey by the secondaries asset manager showed . "This is the second time in the last five years or so that the exit environment has been in this wait-and-see mode," said Kyle Walters, a PE analyst at PitchBook. "LPs were much more understanding the first time around … but this time, you see fewer patient LPs," he told CNBC, adding that LPs are opting to sell off portions of PE portfolios to secondary funds as they opt for cash rather than wait further. According to PitchBook, 54.7% of all active PE funds globally are now six years or older, higher than the 52.2% at the end of 2024 — a sign that fund timelines are stretching well past the norm. What's behind the exit freeze The exit slowdown began as early as 2022 but accelerated after April 2 when the Trump administration announced sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs that jolted financial markets, market watchers said. Harold Hope, global head of secondary investing at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, said the core issue is a "valuation gap" between what PE managers think their companies are worth and what potential buyers are willing to pay. Buyers and sellers are not seeing eye to eye," he said, explaining that the trend began after 2021, when buyers became more conservative as interest rates rose, among other factors. "With a lack of strategic buyers, the dead IPO market here [especially] in the United States, firms are left with the third alternative, which is selling to themselves via a continuation fund, or selling to other private equity funds," Hooke said. "It may never see the IPO market or strategic buyer for, you know, 15-20 years." Other alternatives: continuation vehicles General partners, who are the people or firms managing the private equity funds, are looking to alternative liquidity strategies. Goldman Sachs' Hope noted that continuation vehicles provide a way to generate liquidity in an environment when the fund manager may not want to — or can't — sell the entire business at a value that they believe is appropriate, he said. "Particularly as GPs regularly extend investment periods." The exit drought has also led some private equity managers — especially smaller or mid-sized firms — to explore alternative strategies, including allocating more toward public markets. "Rolling up and constantly putting equity into larger and larger deals is not something that we find relatively attractive going forward," said Jonathan Hahn, investment analyst at private markets investment firm NorthStar Capital. "It's an unsustainable practice… especially with business owners wanting to eventually pull out the equity and actually have it as cash." Instead, Hahn is leaning into the public market opportunity, adding that the firm has launched a new public equities fund because of the recent ramping up of activity within the space. He also observed that PE's sheen may be starting to wear off, noting that some investors are asking themselves: Why would I go into the private markets when I can get the same or better return in public markets and have better liquidity?

Article: Voyager Technologies clinched a $3.8 billion valuation two months ago, as the defense and space company's stock opened 125% higher on Wednesday at $69.75 apiece, above its $31 offer price. On Thursday, Northrop Grumman-backed Firefly Aerospace — whose Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down on the Moon earlier this year — surged in its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol FLY. This might seem like a small step for some industries, but it's a giant leap for traditional offerings for the space sector, where for some time players such as Intuitive Machines, Rocket Lab and AST SpaceMobile listed by way of mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) — shell firms that pool their IPO proceeds to consolidate with a private company and take it public, bypassing some of the typical regulatory scrutiny. But recent geopolitical volatility triggered by the conflict in the Middle East and by Washington's protectionist trade policies have cast a shadow over global appetite for dealmaking and going public, bankers have mentioned anecdotally. "Companies aligned with national priorities and innovation, and those able to present a credible equity story with realistic valuations and flexible timing, are likely to succeed in navigating this complex environment." Space companies, by definition, tick at least some of those boxes. Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPOX, qualified this is "definitely a good time for Space IPOs," with initiatives like the U.S.' push for the Golden Dome missile interception system fueling high valuations. "Still, most firms in the sector are dependent on foreign-made satellite components, creating a vulnerability to cost increases and deployment delays caused by trade disputes." He nevertheless warned that the "intensifying" competition in the private launch market — where companies are looking to reduce costs, particularly by deploying reusable tech and infrastructure — could create "downward pressure on costs." "This will be a key factor in lowering the sector's high entry barriers, making a new generation of space-based business models commercially feasible," Muehlbauer noted. These companies are not being valued on near-term cash flow, but on their ability to deliver long-term strategic infrastructure," Cristiano Dalla Bona, who heads North America ECM analysis at Mergermarket, said in emailed comments. Still, the credibility and visibility on growth of each new candidate will likely be scrutinized." The sector has also been firmly in the public eye, with headlines ranging from NASA layoffs, Elon Musk's vocal involvement with — and later explosive exit from — the White House and Trump's push for the Golden Dome missile interception system.

Article: After taking a backseat to the jobs report earlier this year, inflation data will take center stage next week as investors try to discern whether the Federal Reserve will cut in September. But, any suggestion that inflation is getting away from the central bank's 2% target, just as the labor market shows significant weakening, will add to stagflation fears, and thwart that outlook. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500 in 2025 But more strategists and technicians are worried a pullback is around the corner, of 5% or worse, citing high valuations, flagging momentum and rising concentration risk. This week, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed out the S & P 500 is trading at a ratio of around 22 , based on different forward price-to-earnings multiples, that reflect "peak confidence." There's also the seasonal weakness, given that August is a historically poor month for equities . "And I am just concerned that there's a headline that could spook this market — this market has been on a tremendous run — and cause us to correct if we were to pull back." On Friday, however, the major averages each closed out a winning week. But the next batch of inflation reports that come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics could bring with it new questions around the trustworthiness of government data going forward, after President Donald Trump last week fired the BLS commissioner following the issuance of a weak jobs report . Miran is a potentially dovish pick who could act in opposition to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering interest rates, and raises questions of the future for Fed independence.

Article: Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. The probe is focused on whether James' office caused a deprivation of legal rights under the color of law through its civil suits against Trump and his businesses as well as the National Rifle Association, these people said. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers' rights." A spokesperson for the U.S. In 2024, James' office did win its civil fraud case against the longtime head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, with a jury convicting him of diverting millions of dollars from the gun group for his own personal lifestyle. The letter called the "threadbare allegations" the "next salvo in President Trump's revenge tour against Attorney General James." In addition to her fraud case against Trump and his companies, James and her office have launched a number of successful legal challenges to his administration's agenda, dating back to his first term in office. In 2021, he sued to stop her from proceeding with her fraud investigation, saying, "Her mission is guided solely by political animus and a desire to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against a private citizen who she views as a political opponent." The lawsuit also alleged that Trump was the victim of "viewpoint discrimination." Trump later dropped the suit, but has continued to criticize James, including in an April Truth Social post that called her a "wacky" and "totally corrupt politician" who should immediately resign.

Article: OpenStore, co-founded by Rabois in 2021, is shutting down nearly all of the 40-plus Shopify stores it acquired, and it's in the process of liquidating any remaining inventory by offering steep discounts to move merchandise. The dramatic downsizing to a single brand comes as OpenStore in recent weeks raised a $15 million funding round that valued the company at just $50 million, a fraction of its previous $1 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. Companies in the space took advantage of low interest rates and pandemic-driven growth in online retail to collectively raise more than $16 billion from top names on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley with the intent of rolling up independent sellers on marketplaces like Amazon and Shopify. He posted on Twitter (now X) in April 2021, the "best talent i have ever worked with is joining Openstore." About a year later, Business Insider quoted Rabois in a story saying, "We can absolutely handle acquiring a business in a day," and that "I eventually want to get to one an hour, but that is definitely a challenge."

Article: Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. "We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That's what we want to do." Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would "take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said: "Well, we don't want to keep it. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who "look very hungry," that there is "real starvation" there and that "you can't fake that." Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said. officials briefed on the call described it as "a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid" in which Trump "was doing most of the talking." "The U.S. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option. The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. "Now all ideas are being exhausted." The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is "no chance they can kill every fighter." The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened. Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza. "Looking at the condition of hostages, it's clear that they don't have much more time," one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.

Article: Meta debuted the Instagram Map tool on Wednesday, pitching the feature as way to "stay up-to-date with friends" by letting users share their "last active location." The tool is akin to Snapchat's Snap Map feature that lets people see where their friends are posting from. Although Meta said in a blog post that the feature's "location sharing is off unless you opt in," several social media users said in posts that they were worried that was not the case. "Instagram randomly updating their app to include a maps feature without actually alerting people is so incredibly dangerous to anyone who has a restraining order and actively making sure their abuser can't stalk their location online…Why," said the user in a Threads post. "We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too," Mosseri wrote on Thursday. "We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share)." Still, some Instagram users claimed that that their locations were being shared despite not opting in to using the map feature. A Meta spokesperson reiterated Mosseri's comments in a statement and said "Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on." "If you do, only people you follow back — or a private, custom list you select — can see your location," the spokesperson said.

Article: Since early last year, Musk has been trying to convince shareholders that Tesla, his only publicly traded business, is poised to become an an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse, and not just an electric vehicle company. A centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles. Tesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis. On Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be "operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents," referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips. On the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent. Musk said the companies "are doing different things." He said, "xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models." Tesla uses "100x smaller models," he said, with the automaker focused on "real-world AI," for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for "artificial super intelligence." Musk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because "they wanted to work on AGI," one reason he said he formed a new company.

Article: In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WASHINGTON, DC August 6: US President Donald Trump shakes hands with CEO of Apple Tim Cook during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday August 6, 2025. "The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back." Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt. "CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time," said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple. "What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters," said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S. For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning , in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an "investment" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning "already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets," adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year. While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that "the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook." Trump had a different take. In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach.

"We're also excited that Gen Z has grown to over half of our user base." Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly told analysts in the company's Thursday earnings call that there's still some lingering concern from advertisers related to tariffs "and broader market uncertainty" that the company discussed in May. Snap's revenue grew only 9% year over year in the second quarter, far lower than peers such as Reddit and Meta, which saw their recent quarterly sales jump 78% and 22%, respectively. Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines when it reported its second-quarter earnings on July 23, and Meta said on July 30 that its second-quarter revenue hit $47.52 billion.

Article: "In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement," Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he has selected Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to a pivotal seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned Friday. "He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job," Trump added. "By selecting Miran, Trump has made a stop-gap appointment and given himself until January to make the main call," Marco Casiraghi, senior economist and strategist at Evercore ISI, said in a note. "This way Trump did not tie his hands, keeping his options open regarding the choice of the new Fed governor and especially the new Fed chair." Miran still needs Senate confirmation to the seven-person board, something unlikely to happen until the upper house reconvenes in September. With a vote likely weeks away on the nomination, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (S.C.) in a statement praised Miran as "an accomplished economist" who "has been instrumental in advising on economic policy and advancing a pro-growth agenda in his role as CEA Chair." Scott, who has been critical of the Fed's expansion project at two of its Washington buildings, added that he looked forward to "hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics." Prior to serving in the first Trump White House as senior advisor for economic policy under then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Miran was senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. He has since spoke in favor of reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has used extensively this year as part of a global trade war, and he also has been strongly pro-crypto. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the past has advocated for a shadow chair, reasoning that even if the Fed does not meet the administration's demands, Powell's positions could be counteracted by a dissenting voice on the board who would voice the White House's positions on monetary policy.

Article: Bonnie Cash | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. "What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards "Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs," said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. "Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation." For example, just 39% of independents approve of the president's handling of the economy, and that drops to 24% on inflation. The conflicts could be the result of the public simply having trouble keeping up with the breakneck changes to the economy, immigration, taxation and the political system issuing from the Trump administration. Those are the best numbers since the early years of the Biden administration as the nation emerged from the pandemic, and an 11-point improvement from the CNBC survey in April. The sharp improvement to +4 percentage points from -15 percentage points has come with a surge in stocks that followed the president backing off from sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs and the passage of tax legislation.

Article: "GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models," said Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead at OpenAI. The company said it expects to hit 700 million weekly active users on ChatGPT this week, and it is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale at a valuation of roughly $500 billion, as CNBC previously reported . During the briefing, OpenAI demonstrated how GPT-5 can be used for "vibe coding," which is a term for when users generate software with AI based on a simple written prompt. The apps had "some rough edges," an OpenAI lead said, but users can make additional tweaks to the AI-generated software, like changing the background or adding additional tabs, as they see fit. This launch will be the first time that Free users have access to a reasoning model, which is a type of model that "thinks," or carries out an internal chain of thought, before responding. "It's hard to believe it's only been two and a half years since @sama joined us in Redmond to show the world GPT-4 for the first time in Bing, and it's incredible to see how far we've come since that moment," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a Thursday X post, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's appearance at Microsoft headquarters in Washington in February 2023. Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, said previous AI models have failed many of the company's most advanced tests because they struggle to make sense of complex math or logic within long documents. But Levie said GPT-5 is a "complete breakthrough." "The model is able to retain way more of the information that it's looking at, and then use a much higher level of reasoning and logic capabilities to be able to make decisions," Levie told CNBC in an interview.

Article: "I think it was pretty loosey goosey for the last year or two, and I think the companies have got a lot better at that right now," said Manish Kashyap, CBRE's global president of leasing. "They're coming up with policies that allow hybrid structures and allow flexibility, but whatever their new policy is, their implementation around that, and the governance around that, is definitely a lot better." Nearly three quarters of the 184 companies surveyed by CBRE said they have met their attendance goals, up from 61% last year. The majority of survey respondents, 67% of companies, said they will either keep their office footprints at the same size or expand them within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago. Concerns about the economy and tariffs do have some companies hesitating to make long-term decisions, but even with that concern, more are taking on long-term leases than were a year ago, CBRE found. "You have organizations that finally have clarity and decision making, because they've been living in this world of hybrid for so long, and now they know what it truly looks like for them, so all those decisions that they may have put off, even if there's a little bit of economic uncertainty right now, they're still willing to move forward with some additional deals," said Julie Whelan, CBRE's global head of occupier research. Despite the fact that overall office vacancies are at 18.9%, just under the 30-year high of 19%, nearly half of the companies surveyed said they were concerned about the availability of high-quality office space over the next three years. That concern is most significant when it comes to prime space, which accounts for only 8% of the total office inventory and has much lower vacancy rate than the rest of the market.

Also on Thursday, Eli Lilly released long-awaited late-stage trial data on its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, the highest dose of which helped patients lose more than 12% of their body weight. Investors have to decide what they think," Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "But Lilly is rolling, and you look at the beat and raise, strong growth on the back half, we're excited about the future for our company and for patients who need our products."

Article: Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving the way for its entrance into the market. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss "a significant and clinically meaningful outcome." "Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies," he continued. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill "has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects." The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. They bring Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, one step closer to potentially becoming a new, needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. "The goal was to create an oral pill that was convenient and can be made at a huge scale, really, for the mass market, and had weight loss that was competitive with other single-acting GLP-1s, and that's what we've achieved," Ricks said. Ricks said Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with hopes of launching the pill around the world "this time next year." That launch could fundamentally shift the space, helping more patients access the treatments and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacture pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. There are roughly 8 million patients on injectable obesity and diabetes drugs, but likely around 170 million who could benefit from the medicines, said Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in an interview. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at the University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in.

Trump said that he expects new U.S. "So can't tell you exactly when, but I want to be around a year from now." Apple on Wednesday said it created the so-called American Manufacturing Program that includes Corning , Coherent , GlobalWafers, Applied Materials , Texas Instruments , Samsung, GlobalFoundries , Amkor and Broadcom . "President Trump shared some kind words about that work, but he also asked us to think about what more we could commit to doing," Cook said about Apple's earlier initial $500 billion commitment. President, we took that challenge very seriously." Trump has criticized Apple and Cook for not making its smartphones in the U.S., a move that Apple has never signaled that it is likely to make. "If you look at the bulk of it, we're doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we're doing the glass here, we're doing the face ID module here," Cook said. Trump said on Wednesday that he planned to impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors and chips, but that Apple was exempt because it is committing to build in the U.S. are assembled in India to avoid Chinese tariffs, and although tariffs on India are going up to 25%, White House sources told CNBC that the iPhone maker will be "largely unaffected" by the India tariffs.

Article: The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy." Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer," Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, "we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices." If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030. While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals. But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine. India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler. In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price. "Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. "Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line. A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows. "It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Article: The extra duties — set to come into effect within 21 days — will be stacked on top of the 25% tariffs on New Delhi due Thursday stateside, according to the executive order. Its total goods' exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data. The resulting drop in exports due to tariffs would mean the economy grows by closer to 6% this year and next, rather than the 7% growth forecast prior to Trump's announcement, Shah said. With notable variance across industries and little clarity over Trump's plans with sector-specific tariffs, here are segments that potentially stand to lose the most: Engineering goods Engineering goods, including products like auto parts, power equipment and industrial machinery, have been India's biggest of exports to the U.S. Rajesh Mehta, executive chairman of Indian jewelry maker Rajesh Exports, said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday that higher tariffs will be an "additional burden," while calling for government support for the sector . "Without a doubt, the new tariff rate is going to seriously test the resolve and resilience of India's textile and apparel exporters as we will not enjoy a significant duty differential advantage vis-à-vis many other countries, except Bangladesh, with whom we compete for a larger share of the US market," the Confederation of Indian textile industry said in a statement dated July 30 , before the latest hike in duties was announced. for 38% of its exports last fiscal year, making it "the most exposed" to potential risks of the tariff exemptions being rolled back, according to Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. In an interview to CNBC Trump said he would initially impose a "small tariff" on pharma, and then raise that rate to as high as 250% in a few years. "[India's] Chemicals overall have somewhat less US exposure but this masks the high pharmaceutical sector's US dependency therein," said Hermann, leaving the pharma sector highly vulnerable to Trump's potential tariffs. India competes against the likes of Europe in pharmaceuticals; Vietnam and Mexico in electronics; Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam in textiles; and Israel in gems and jewelry, according to Wan. In his latest tariff adjustment, Trump also eased tariffs on Thailand to 19% from the "reciprocal" tariff level of 36%, Bangladesh to 20% from 35% and Cambodia to 19% from 36%.

China's U.S.-bound goods currently face a 20% tariff related to the country's alleged role in the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a 10% baseline tariff, stacked on top of a 25% duty on certain goods imposed during Trump's first term. Trump has threatened to impose new sectoral levies that will impact countries including China, such as a tariff on pharmaceuticals that could go up to 200%, and an about 100% "secondary tariff" for buying Russian oil. China's factory activity unexpectedly deteriorated to a three-month low in July, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index falling to 49.3 from June's reading of 49.7, missing expectations for 49.7.

Details on how much domestic manufacturing is required to qualify for the exemption remain unclear. However, South Korean chip majors Samsung and SK Hynix appeared to be exempted from the 100% tariffs, the country's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo was reported as saying on the radio. "We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors," Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that companies like Apple that are building or committed to building in the U.S. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, noted that "the devil is in the details" as there is no clear framework yet on how exactly the chip tariffs are going to work. While Japanese semiconductor process equipment markets may wobble at the start given the headline shock of "100% tariffs," the move could be positive for the industry given the number of Japanese chipmaking equipment that are indispensable for most chipmakers looking to ramp up U.S. As of this moment, the big companies are the "clear winners," said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, citing companies like Apple, Nvidia and TSMC as the ones with the "most dollars to pledge." "These are the big wins that President Trump wants to get," Newman said, adding that the smaller companies that do not have the same scale and leverage will have to negotiate.

President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

That marks a stark reversal from earlier optimism, when Modi and Trump aimed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating." "All bets are off now," he added. India's External Affairs Ministry responded sharply to criticism over Russian oil purchases Tuesday, calling it "unjustified and unreasonable." The ministry also pointed out that Western nations criticizing India are themselves continuing to trade with Russia. Nikki Haley urged the administration not to "burn a relationship with a strong ally like India," highlighting that China, which is Russia's top oil buyer, received a 90-day tariff pause in May. Former Indian Finance Secretary Subhash Garg echoed that sentiment on CNBC's " Inside India " Tuesday: "Our positions are so different that there is very little possibility of a reconciliation." He suggested India should absorb the export hit and diversify to domestic or alternative markets.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

Article: The move was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes after the Reserve Bank of India delivered an outsized cut of 50 basis points at its last meeting in June. On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." While domestic growth remains "resilient," the central bank noted that the outlook for external demand is still "uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations." "The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, persisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to the growth outlook." During the RBI's last meeting, Malhotra said that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the 50-basis-point cut in June. As such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative." This means that the Monetary Policy Committee, which is the RBI's key decision-making body, will carefully assess the "incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy," Malhotra said. However, the BofA analysts left the door open for a possible rate cut later this year — likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 — once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. The RBI also maintained its GDP growth forecast for its financial year ending March 2026 at 6.5%, but cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous projection of 3.7%. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee also said on Wednesday that the near-term inflation outlook has "become more benign than anticipated earlier," while inflation in 2025 is expected to remain significantly below the central bank's target of 4%.

Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil."

But that did not quell growing unease within the country, as many viewed the layoffs as a sign of broader and disruptive changes underway in the IT sector, amplified by the growing influence of AI. TCS and its peers have long relied on India's vast pool of low-cost, skilled labor to produce software services, a model now coming under pressure as AI is set to automate repetitive tasks and as global clients demand higher levels of innovation.

Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Monthly stablecoin transaction volumes between businesses had surged to more than $3 billion by early 2025, from under $100 million at the start of 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Artemis from May. That has attracted the interest of major payment processors such as Visa , Mastercard , and Stripe , all of which have begun integrating stablecoin support into their payment infrastructure. Capella Hotel, a Singapore-based high-end hotel group, started allowing guests to complete transactions using digital currencies in October last year, due to "growing demand [for] secure and convenient payment option," according to its statement. The boutique handbag reseller is eyeing to expand crypto payments in its Hong Kong branch in the coming months, as well as in its Tokyo branch in the next few years.

Despite the bumper quarterly performance, Nintendo maintained its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 2026 unchanged at 1.9 trillion yen and 320 billion yen, respectively. The device, which launched on June 5, sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days and Nintendo expects it will hit 15 million unit sales in the current fiscal year. However, analysts at Morningstar believe Nintendo will weather the storm by increasing its overall gaming audience." "Although Nintendo's profitability is expected to decline in the short term due to higher tariff rates, the company will recoup the losses in the long term by selling more games to a larger user base," said Kazunori Ito, director of equity research at Morningstar. For its part, Nintendo said Friday that, "While there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the U.S.

Article: Cambodia "This is a good news for the citizens and economy of Cambodia to continue developing the country," Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a Facebook post on Friday after the revised table of tariffs was released. Thailand Thailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said in a post on X that the tariff rate levied on the country "reflects the close friendship and partnership between Thailand and the United States," according to a Google translation of his statement in Thai. However, he said that the government recognizes the impact of the tariffs on entrepreneurs and farmers, and has prepared "comprehensive support measures," including soft loans, subsidies, and tax measures so as to help Thailand adapt. Taiwan will also discuss supply chain cooperation and issues related to Section 232 in the future, he added, referring to the sectoral tariffs that Trump had imposed on national security grounds. 1] general tariff rate will ease and not burden our economy," according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Malay He also confirmed that Trump would be attending the 47th ASEAN summit in October, being held in Malaysia. "What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market," he said, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to local media, the country's Trade Minister Todd McClay said it seemed as though the tariff rates were targeting countries that have trade deficits with the U.S., but that the size of it was "really not significant or meaningful" in New Zealand's case. "Many of the exporters are saying they have been able to absorb the 10 percent, or in many cases pass it on, but at 15 percent it is going to start having a greater effect on our exporters," he said. On social media platform X, the country's federal council, said it noted "with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." "Switzerland has been and remains in contact with the relevant US authorities. "While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong," he said.

Article: Philip Fong | Afp | Getty Images Visitor interest in Japan plunged in June, amid a prophecy in a manga that predicted a "disaster" would strike Japan in July 2025. The prediction was in a 2021 reprint of a Japanese comic book, or manga, titled "Watashi ga Mita Mirai, Kanzenban" (which translates to "The Future That I Saw, Complete Edition") by artist Ryo Tatsuki. In the original printing of the book in 1999, the cover page referenced a "disaster in March 2011." In March 2011, Japan suffered its most powerful earthquake on record, the Great Tohoku Earthquake, which caused almost 20,000 deaths and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG told CNBC that the rumor was widely circulated in Hong Kong, where it spread over mainstream media, TV networks and through YouTube influencers. "This is the first time we've seen such an incident." Hong Kong and Japanese media reported earlier in July that Hong Kong airlines cut flights to some Japanese cities, including Nagoya. A January report from Japan's Asahi Shimbun, citing the country's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, also warned that the likelihood of a megaquake in the next 30 years had risen to 80%—a development that, combined with the prediction, created a "perfect storm" to deter travelers, Yuen said. However, Japan's Meteorological Agency said: "It should be noted that the issuance of information indicating elevated potential for a Nankai Trough earthquake does not necessarily mean that one will actually strike." Asian tourists more affected than Western ones JNTO data showed that the share of Asian tourists fell year on year in June, but that of Western countries rose.

Blueprint with Britain The acrimony with Washington, though, is a world away from the positive mood surrounding the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement concluded with the U.K. will eliminate tariffs on 99% of all Indian goods, up from about 73% currently, making the effective tariff rate for Indian exporters close to zero, according to the team led by Sajjid Chinoy, JPMorgan's chief India economist. "It's a proper strategic partnership for the future now." Some friction persists Despite the comprehensive nature of the agreement, the final deal does not include an exemption for India from the U.K.'s carbon tax, which is set to begin in 2027. Goyal said India would oppose any such measures, which he characterized as "non-tariff barriers." "India will continue to explore every option that's available to us under the World Trade Organisation to stop such measures from hurting trade between the two countries," Goyal said. "We are always very sensitive to the interests of our farmers, the interests of our [Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises], and will ensure that our areas of concern are well protected," Goyal said.

Article: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images Come Friday, the world will have to contend with higher tariff rates from the Trump administration, raising the specter of even more economic uncertainty. Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done "over 200 deals" in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that "90 deals in 90 days" was possible. Vietnam: tariffs more than halved Vietnam was the second to cross the line with the Trump administration, with Trump announcing a trade agreement on July 2 that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slashed from 46% to 20%. One point with Vietnam was a 40% "transshipping" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S, although it is not clear how this will be applied. Philippines: marginal decrease Unlike its ASEAN counterparts above, which had sizable reductions to its tariff duties, the Philippines saw a decrease of a single percentage point to 19% from 20% on July 22. goods as part of the agreement, according to Trump, who praised the country for what he described as "going OPEN MARKET with the United States." In addition, Trump also said that the Philippines will work together "Militarily," without specifying any details. after China, seeing its tariff rate cut to 15% from 25% on July 23, and being the first economy to see a lower preferential tariff rate for its key automobile sector. would "receive 90% of the Profits." The path to this agreement was fraught with uncertainty, with Trump saying days before the agreement that he did not expect the two countries to reach a deal. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou went as far as saying it was an act of "submission" and a "dark day." EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, however, called it "the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances." South Korea: also at 15% South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement, on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "90% of the profits" from that $350 billion investment will be "going to the American people." However, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the $350 billion fund will play a role in facilitating the "active entry" of Korean companies into the U.S. It was initially hit with a 34% tariff from "Liberation Day," before a series of back-and-forth measures between the two sides saw the duties skyrocket to 145% duties for Chinese imports to the U.S. For countries without a deal, it appears that a higher global baseline tariff of about 15%-20% will be slapped on them, according to Trump, higher than the 10% baseline announced on "Liberation Day." Countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. India: tariffs and a penalty On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on India, with an additional unspecified "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. "While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what Trump imposed on India on "Liberation Day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner, but at the high end of the 20%-25% range that the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that the partners were in an "intense phase" of talks, noting that it would be unlikely for an agreement not to include any tariffs, Reuters reported.

Article: First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re Andy Palmer The emergence of CAT bonds as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In just the last few weeks, Greece has been battling major wildfires across the country, temperatures notched a national record of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in neighboring Turkey, destructive and deadly flooding took place in Texas and climate change triggered record-breaking heat in Iceland and Greenland. 'Astronomical growth' Alongside increasing usage of the CAT bond market by insurers and reinsurers, it is thought that the portfolio diversification benefits of these bonds has helped to drive a surge in investor interest. Reinsurance company Swiss Re said in a report published Wednesday that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down. Andy Palmer, head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, said "astronomical growth" had helped to push the size of the CAT bond market to nearly $56 billion in the first half of the year.

Article: watch now President Donald Trump is taking a victory lap over the foreign investment pledges he has secured as part of several recent trade deals, variously describing the multibillion-dollar commitments as a "signing bonus" and "seed money" and a "gift." "If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy." Last month, Trump likened the trade deal with Japan, which includes a pledge of $550 billion in investment, to "seed money." "Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Moreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview. "The European Union and her Member States have very limited capabilities to direct private actors to make these purchases and investments," David Kleimann, a trade expert and senior research associate at ODI Europe, told CNBC.

"The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff. This tactic worked during Trump's first term, with the EU demonstrating soaring LNG and soybean imports from the US." Underlining problems with the feasibility of the EU's energy pledge, Peker said even if the bloc bought all U.S. 'A negotiating tactic' "I think it is a negotiating tactic, but I would have expected the EU to come up with the first round to be more realistic and more favorable to the EU," Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, lead energy analyst for the Europe team at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told CNBC by video call. She pointed out that for the EU to meet its annual commitment of $250 billion of energy products over the next three years, the EU would need to source about 70% of its energy imports from the country, a prospect that raises supply security concerns.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Egon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets.

"Inside the upstream, we've had tremendous performance, along with record operating efficiency [and] along with starting up five new major projects," BP's Auchincloss told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe", just after the release of the company's second-quarter results. He added that he was "very optimistic" about the company's latest exploration discovery in the Bumerangue block in Brazil's Santos Basin, just over 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) from Rio de Janeiro. watch now After underperforming its peers in recent years, the firm has shifted gears by way of a fundamental strategic reset that will see BP prioritize fossil fuels and slash renewable spending. Earlier on Tuesday, the energy major reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.35 billion for the three months through June — comfortably beating analyst expectations of $1.81 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. Ramping up investor returns, the company also said its quarterly dividend will increase to 8.32 cents from 8 cents and that it will maintain the pace of its share buyback program at $750 million for the second quarter.

Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

"We expect that the Court will find that the banks were liable under statute, focussing on egregious discretionary commissions, but will clear them of liability in equity and under tort," Benjamin Toms, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note published Monday.

Article: LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Thursday said that Microsoft and Amazon are hurting competition in the cloud computing industry and called for a probe into their market dominance under the country's strict new tech rules. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power" and reap financial gain exceeding the cost of capital expenditure over a sustained period. Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have built huge businesses by offering access to computing resources — such as data storage and processing — via the internet using data centers, large facilities that contain dedicated hardware. The CMA is concerned that certain practices within the space, such as egress fees and unfavorable licensing terms, are creating a "lock-in" effect where businesses are getting trapped into contractual agreements that are difficult to get out of. Microsoft said the regulator's decision "misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes." "Its recommendations fail to cover Google, one of the fastest-growing cloud market participants," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. Amazon also disputed the CMA's findings and said recommendations for a fresh probe into the two tech giants' dominance of cloud were "unwarranted." "It risks making the UK a global outlier at a time when businesses need regulatory predictability for the UK to maintain international competitiveness," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. Swift action will be "essential to ensure British businesses pay a fair price and to unleash choice, innovation and economic growth in teh U.K.," Chris Lindsay, Google's vice president of customer engineering for EMEA, said in a statement.

During this period, firms are limited to holding only £50,000 of total customer deposits — well below the hundreds of billions of pounds customers deposit with major high street lenders such as Barclays , HSBC and Santander . Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported Tuesday that a meeting arranged by British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves with Revolut and the PRA was cancelled after an intervention from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. "Revolut is already a regulated bank in over 30 countries, including some of the toughest jurisdictions in the world," he told CNBC, noting the company is worth more than some major U.K banks on a rumored $65 billion valuation . Regulators are nervous about getting it wrong due to the lingering "scar tissue" of the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fraud prevention platform Sardine AI. "My guess is that these complaints and issues have shown up in the BoE's regulatory reports, and they have material, well grounded concerns." Still, Taylor conceded that Revolut has "some of the most sophisticated technology to detect and prevent these issues, and has been at the front line of dealing with the scams issue." 'Symbolic win' Ensuring Revolut obtains full authorization to operate a bank is important for the U.K. — jobs, taxes, equity gains — has been eroded," Cleo's Hussey-Yeo said, adding that there was a heightened risk that richly valued fintechs like Revolut could move their global headquarters outside of the U.K. "The Chancellor [of the Exchequer] cannot afford to lose Revolut to another jurisdiction — but Revolut looks at a global market and sees lots of willing suitors for its business, and very little willingness from the U.K.," he told CNBC.

Article: "The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska," Trump said in a Truth Social post. Trump had pledged "secondary tariffs" of "about 100%" on Russia's trade partners, if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, setting an initial 50-day timeline that was later shortened. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a key foreign policy objective of his second presidential mandate, reversing course on an initial thawing of White House relations with Moscow to now pile on pressure on the Kremlin for the lull in diplomatic progress. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travelled for an eleventh-hour meeting with Putin, which Trump hailed as "highly productive." "Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come," he said Wednesday. "At the President's direction, Special Envoy Witkoff once again met with President Putin to discuss potential paths to peace, and the President and his national security team are discussing those paths with both the Ukrainians and the Europeans," Leavitt said. "Out of respect for our sensitive diplomatic discussions with Russia, Ukraine, and our European allies, the White House will not comment on alleged details in the news media." Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an X post that he thought the U.S. At the heart of Russia and Ukraine's inability to strike a ceasefire to date have been differences over Putin's maximalist demands that the war can only end if Kyiv gives up its ambitions to join the NATO military alliance and if Moscow retains four Ukrainian regions annexed during the latest conflict. Very disappointed." Secondary tariffs At risk for Russia is the potential dissolution of its scant remaining client base for its crude and oil products volumes, which countries within the G7 are no longer permitted to take on a seaborne basis. Under a G7 scheme, nations outside of the coalition retain critical access to Western shipping and insurance mechanisms as long as they only purchase Russian supplies under a price cap. Russia's sanctions-sapped economy heavily depends on its crude sales, amid increasing isolation on the international stage and dwindling growth expected near 1.4% this year, from 4.3% in 2024, according to the World Bank's June forecasts.

Article: President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum that requires universities to collect admissions data to prove they are not engaged in efforts to shape their student bodies along racial lines, according to the White House. Supreme Court ruling knocked down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, but universities have skirted that decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race. Department of Education said in a statement that Education Secretary Linda McMahon had directed the National Center for Education Statistics to collect from universities data on the race and gender of their applicant pool, on the students admitted and of all enrolled undergraduates. Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 member schools, said collecting such data was illegal under the very Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action. "This seems to be an effort to get institutions to provide information that we don't have and that we can't collect." But a senior Trump administration official said the administration's understanding of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action was that nothing in it "prohibits the collection of demographic data as long as such data is not used in admissions decisions." The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter, spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Article: Mary Kay burns incense at the entrance to the state-managed immigration detention center dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades on August 03, 2025 in Ochopee, Florida. A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Article: Pavel Bednyakov | Sputnik | via Reuters DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan traveled to Russia on Thursday for his second visit to the country in less than a year, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sign of the ever-strengthening ties between the two states. The trip, according to Emirati state media service WAM, was focused on the two countries' "strategic partnership" and on "ways to enhance cooperation, particularly in the economic, trade, investment, energy, and other areas that serve joint development, in addition to regional and international issues of common interest." The UAE is a longtime close ally of the United States and a major military and intelligence partner. It is also Russia's most important economic partner in the Middle East — and trade between the two has ballooned in recent years, particularly since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Bin Zayed told his Russian counterpart: "We would like this figure to be doubled both at the bilateral level and with Eurasian countries during the next five years," adding that relations between the two countries "are developing at an accelerated pace." Russia and the UAE signed a strategic partnership in 2018, and numerous visits between their leaders have been exchanged since then.

"As before, the UAE wants to continue to maintain a diversified foreign policy overall between Russia, the United States, and China, rather than choose only one." The UAE leader's visit also comes as the White House announced an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin to discuss Ukraine war ceasefire efforts — and in the wake of Trump announcing punitive tariffs on India for importing Russian oil, which the American leader says is "fuelling the war machine." For Russia, the ongoing relationship with the UAE is a win and is also "clearly a sign that they are not nearly as isolated as the West would like them to be both diplomatically and economically," said Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Rane. For [UAE leader] MBZ on a political front, this is a demonstration that he is independent of Washington, despite relying on American forces for security," Bohl said, referring to Mohammed bin Zayed by his initials. It is an important transit hub for dual-use goods, meaning goods that can have both civilian and military use, so this trade helps fuel Russia's war on Ukraine," Borshchevskaya said.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the Ukraine issue and discussed the possibility of developing strategic cooperation between Moscow and Washington, but declined to give more details until Witkoff had reported back to Trump.

"Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent," the executive order reads. It's the latest sign that Trump is following through on his threat to punish countries that buy Russian oil, as he's increased his rhetoric in recent weeks over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The tariffs against India came as Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Wednesday in Moscow with Putin, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. A White House official said the meeting "went well" and "the Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States." The secondary tariffs that Trump has threatened against countries that buy Russian oil are still expected to be implemented Friday, the official said. "We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India," an official spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs said.

Article: They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men. Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as "very manual" and "not efficient." It is "something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were," he said.

Article: Conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch will give President Donald Trump regular updates on his health as part of an agreement to postpone Murdoch's deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him over a Wall Street Journal article about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday. "Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health," the filing says.

Article: Brazil's Supreme Court put former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on Monday ahead of his trial for an alleged coup plot, underscoring the court's resolve despite escalating tariffs and sanctions from U.S. In an interview with Reuters last month, Bolsonaro called Moraes a "dictator" and said the restraining orders against him were acts of "cowardice." Some Bolsonaro allies have worried that Trump's tactics may be backfiring in Brazil, compounding trouble for Bolsonaro and rallying public support behind Lula's leftist government. However, Sunday demonstrations by Bolsonaro supporters — the largest in months — show that Trump's tirades and sanctions against Moraes have also fired up the far-right former army captain's political base. Bolsonaro appeared virtually at a protest in Rio de Janeiro via phone call to his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, in what some saw as the latest test of his restraining orders. sanctions against the judge, adding: "I hope the Supreme Court can put the brakes on this person (Moraes) causing so much upheaval." The judge's orders, including the restraining orders under penalty of arrest, have been upheld by the wider court. Those orders and the larger case before the Supreme Court came after two years of investigations into Bolsonaro's role in an election-denying movement that culminated in riots by his supporters that rocked Brasilia in January 2023. In contrast with the tangle of criminal cases which mostly stalled against Trump, Brazilian courts moved swiftly against Bolsonaro, threatening to end his political career and fracture his right-wing movement. In a statement after the arrest on Monday, Congressman Bolsonaro called Moraes "an out-of-control psychopath who never hesitates to double down." Trump last month shared a letter he had sent to Bolsonaro. The arrest could give Trump a pretext to pile on additional measures against Brazil, said Graziella Testa, a political science professor at the Federal University of Parana, adding that Bolsonaro seemed to be consciously provoking escalation. "I think things could escalate because this will be seen as a reaction to the Magnitsky sanction" against Moraes, said Leonardo Barreto, a partner at the Think Policy political risk consultancy in Brasilia, referring to the asset freeze imposed on Moraes last week.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024.

Article: Starbucks Protein Drink Courtesy: Starbucks Restaurant chains are joining in on the protein frenzy, hoping to encourage diners to pay more for extra macronutrients during a time when many consumers aren't spending as much. From "gym bros" to users of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, many Americans are trying to add more protein to their diets, with the goal of building or maintaining their muscle mass and feeling more satiated after meals. "A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they're looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future," said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. "Generation Alpha, Gen Z, millennials — these consumers are very active on social media, so they're constantly being fed this message that you need more protein, and protein helps you gain muscle and makes you stronger." Roughly a third of consumers said they loved high protein in the second quarter of 2025, up from 24% three years ago, according to Datassential, which tracks restaurant menus and consumer preferences. The coffee giant said in late July that it will roll out a cold foam packed with 15 grams of protein later this year; the regular cold foam add-on typically costs customers an extra $1.25 per drink. "The biggest factor is what I am in the mood for that day, and then I normally try and select a meal that has a least a serving of some type of protein in it," Hutkowski said. In the short term, consuming more protein than your body needs likely won't cause health issues, but in the long term, it could cause kidney problems, according to Diane Han, a registered dietitian based in San Francisco and the founder of Woking Balance Wellness. The recommended daily amount of protein intake varies by body weight but is roughly 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's a convenient, on-the-go way to get in your protein that you're looking for in your diet," said Lori Primavera, Smoothie King's vice president of research and development and product marketing.

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's .

Article: The EPA announced massive job cuts and restructuring in early May, and while it didn't specifically mention Energy Star, numerous reports, citing EPA documents, say it is part of the plan. The EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool connects utilities to landlords and then to dozens of state and municipal governments who rely on it to uphold their energy and climate policies, many of which include tax breaks and financial subsidies for energy savings. Last year, more than 8,800 commercial buildings earned the Energy Star, saving more than $2.2 billion and preventing more than 5.7 million metric tons of emissions, according to the Energy Star website . Landlords rely on Portfolio Manager data to maintain compliance with state and municipal regulation and to gauge energy performance of buildings in their portfolios and decide which ones need upgrades. And so if the system disappears, the data disappears with it, and what this means is that that hub, that connected tissue around how utility landlord and state and municipal governments share energy data across them, that would all go away," said Leia de Guzman, co-founder of Cambio, a real estate operations platform. Cambio, which ingests building data in order to automate real estate operations, can tap into Energy Star data from the past and is offering building owners and managers the option to back up data that already exists.

"It provides hundreds of billions of dollars of savings for consumers and businesses in its current form, and if it were to be managed by an external company, that might result in a fee-based system that would increase the cost to use this program." If Portfolio Manager were no longer a government program, Upano said, the likely result would be a complicated patchwork of compliance.

"If you look at the tech sector's employment trends, they've been basically growing as a share of overall employment in a remarkably linear manner for the last 20 years," Briggs said on the episode of "Goldman Sachs Exchanges" to be aired Tuesday. Companies including Alphabet and Microsoft have said AI is producing roughly 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in June that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.

Article: In this article JPM BAC Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT watch now President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the two largest American banks previously rejected him as a customer, reviving claims that conservative clients were being unfairly denied accounts. Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in a wide-ranging interview that JPMorgan Chase informed him he had 20 days to move "hundreds of millions of dollars in cash" to another bank. Banks generally deny rejecting clientele based on political or religious beliefs, but say they are required to comply with federal laws aimed at preventing financial crimes, including the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act, and have faced regulatory pressure related to crypto and other industries that are considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud. "Banking agencies have already taken steps to address issues like reputational risk, and we're hopeful that any forthcoming executive order will reinforce this progress by directing regulators to confront the flawed regulatory framework that gave rise to these concerns," the Bank Policy Institute told CNBC. While Trump on Tuesday mentioned his business, likely referring to his real estate and hospitality conglomerate, it wasn't clear if the events he described were in reference to personal or business accounts, or both.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs. But he added that "I think the devil will be in the detail."

The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of." An mRNA model is placed in front of the "Area 100 R&D" research laboratory for personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccines at a new facility of BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, on July 27, 2023.

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Article: In this article UNH Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT watch now UnitedHealth Group Chairman and CEO Stephen Hemsley will face the first real test Tuesday of his ability to regain investor confidence as the largest private U.S. The Dow component has seen its share price cut nearly in half since mid-May, with the stock on pace for its worst year in more than a decade, after earnings in its flagship Medicare program and Optum Health physician practices plummeted. Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

Article: UnitedHealth Group revealed Thursday it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices, adding to a string of setbacks for a company that owns the nation's largest and most powerful private insurer. In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In response at the time, the company said it stands "by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program." In July, the Journal also reported that the DOJ interviewed several doctors about UnitedHealth's practices and whether they felt pressured to submit claims for certain conditions that bolstered payments from the Medicare Advantage program to the company.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

Article: Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty Images For well over a decade, Grace Hamilton, 27, experienced hair loss, heavy periods, infrequent menstrual cycles, mental health issues and difficulty losing weight without knowing why. After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety "I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years." Cree, who is also a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. In a recent survey of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter. Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar." Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s. "All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a recent survey from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.

Article: The Bank of England voted by a fine margin to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday as the central bank resumed what it describes as a "gradual and careful" approach to monetary easing. The BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at its latest monetary policy meeting, but traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the decision among the bank's policymakers. As it turned out on Thursday, the nine-member MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the key interest rate, the "Bank Rate," by 25 basis points rather than keeping it on hold. Policy makers have had to weigh up sticky inflation — the consumer price index (CPI) rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — with a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth. In a statement Thursday, the bank said the MPC "remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term." The MPC was initially split on reducing or holding interest rates with four members wanting to hold rates, four others voting to cut and one policymaker voting for a larger 50-basis-point cut.

But as it faces the specter of rebuilding its devastated state after 13 years of war under a new government with a very shaky hold on power, the country needs all the help it can get, regional analysts say — not further punishment. "After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC. "While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States." A collapsed state Syria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group. Yosri Aljamal | Reuters The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December 2024 stunned the global community and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. "So any step that deviates from that, I think, is very dangerous."

Fahad Al-Sulaiti, the director general of Qatar Fund for Development, described how Damascus will need to lean heavily on aid from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations — particularly now that tariffs will harm the possibility of developing beneficial trade ties with the U.S. "The fact that Syria was singled out for the highest tariffs — even after the easing of most sanctions — sends a clear and calculated message from the Trump administration: Washington is willing to loosen its economic grip on a post-regime change Syria, but only under conditions defined by the White House." watch now

Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post.

Another potential reprieve came as the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs told Reuters on Friday it understands the 39% tariff will not include the pharmaceutical sector, which is separately facing volatility from Trump's latest comments on drug pricing. Switzerland's federal council said it had "great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland."

Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a metric that Fed watches closely as a demand indicator, rose just 1.2%, down from the 1.9% increase in Q1 and the slowest gain since the fourth quarter of 2022.

Article: Payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 104,000 for the month, reversing a loss of 23,000 in June and topping the Dow Jones forecast from economists for an increase of 64,000. Though the pace of hiring is well off where it stood last year, the June total was the best since March and consistent with a slowing but still fairly vibrant jobs picture. "Employers have grown more optimistic that consumers, the backbone of the economy, will remain resilient." The report follows months of concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would hold back economic growth and stymie consumer spending.

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Article: "The new EU tariff of 15% means that UK exports to the US have become relatively cheaper, which could boost British trade with the US as American firms buy goods from Britain rather than the EU," he explained. consumers due to the lower tariff rate, meaning they may favor British products over those manufactured in the EU, Alex Altmann, partner and head of Lubbock Fine LLP's German desk, suggested in a note published shortly after the EU-U.S. "The UK's lower US tariffs do offer a major incentive for EU companies to shift some of their manufacturing bases to the UK or to expand their existing UK facilities," he added. Here the UK benefits from its major trading partner averting a recession which could have resulted in a decline in UK exports to the EU," he said in written comments. "If the US had proceeded with 30% tariffs against most EU goods, UK goods with a 10% tariff, which is paid by the US importer in most circumstances, could have appeared significantly more attractive," she said.

Article: President Donald Trump talks to the media as he meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (not pictured) at Trump Turnberry golf club on July 28, 2025 in Turnberry, Scotland. tariffs on incoming goods look to be settling in only slightly less than what President Donald Trump had threatened in April, but the difference has been enough to ease some of Wall Street's worst recession fears. With the U.S.-European Union trade deal over the weekend, it now appears that the effective tariff rate, or the net impact aside from the nominal level, will end up in the 15%-20% range. That's well above the low single-digit rate in place at the beginning of the year, but well off the feared 25% rate or worse that could have happened as a result of the April 2 announcement. Tariffs still a danger Commentary around Wall Street following the U.S-EU deal for 15% tariffs echoed the belief that the recession risk had dimmed, even if tariffs still have the strong potential to exert a stifling impact on growth. "We still believe the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation: Not a recession, but a backdrop where the adverse effects of trade and immigration controls on growth outweigh the boost from deregulation and fiscal largesse," Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Zezas wrote. economy skewing toward a slowdown, but with more clarity on the fiscal situation and deficits now front-loaded, the risk of a substantial recession is easing." The U.S.-Europe deal will give the Federal Reserve more to chew on this week when it discusses the impact that tariffs will have on inflation. Since Trump has taken office, the Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate steady, in large part because policymakers are cautious over the impact tariffs will have on inflation. The Fed is expected to approve a rate cut in September, and the chances of that happening seemingly would increase if the economy weakens while inflation is held in check. "But with major trading partner tariffs stabilizing closer to 15% than the much higher rates proposed on April 2, markets and Fed officials will be increasingly confident that the drag on growth and upside risk to inflation will be modest."

Article: "I got that to mean that I think he's going to start recommending lower rates." Powell and his fellow policymakers have been reluctant to lower rates as they wait to see the impact Trump's tariffs have on inflation. Prior to Trump's remarks, White House budget director Russell Vought kept up the heat on the Fed's renovation project, pushing the case for a review of the central bank while pressing for lower interest rates. "There's a whole host of issues with regard to the Fed, and we want to make sure that those questions get answered over time," Vought said during the "Squawk Box" appearance. "This is not a pressure campaign on the Fed chairman." The tone following Thursday's meeting was more conciliatory after months — and even years — of rancor between the Trump White House and the Powell Fed. Both sides characterized the tour as positive, with a Fed official releasing a statement Friday saying the central bank was "honored" to welcome Trump as well as other Republican officials.

The FTA, which slashes duties on goods including textiles, alcohol and automobiles, was signed Thursday in the presence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer. India's Modi lauded the agreement as "a blueprint for our shared prosperity," highlighting how Indian goods including textiles, jewelry, agricultural products and engineering items would benefit from a better access to the U.K. The U.K.–India trade pact marked a "strategic win" for New Delhi's trade diplomacy as it brings targeted benefits to Indian goods that previously faced high tariffs or regulatory barriers, said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at ANZ Bank.

Article: Horacio Villalobos | Corbis News | Getty Images The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates steady amid major economic uncertainty, as the European Union scrambles to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.S. "The environment remains exceptionally uncertain, especially because of trade disputes," the ECB said in a statement, adding that its inflation and growth outlook from June remained supported by recent data. While annual inflation in the euro area hit the central bank's 2% target last month, traders widely expected a hold in July — in large part due to geopolitical volatility. As of Thursday, the future of that trade relationship remained up in the air, with one possibility being a 15% baseline tariff rate on all EU imports to the U.S., along with retaliatory measures on the EU's part. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane told CNBC earlier this month that "the last cycle is done, bringing inflation down," but that policymakers would remain alert to any changes in the medium-term outlook. Growth risks 'tilted to downside' In a news conference following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the euro zone economy had performed better than expected in the first quarter. Stressing current levels of uncertainty in forecasting, Lagarde went on to say that risks to growth were "tilted to the downside," with an escalation in trade tensions potentially dragging down exports, investment and consumption, as well as weighing on business and household sentiment. Lagarde noted Thursday that a stronger euro could "bring inflation down further than expected" and that higher global tariffs could concurrently dampen price rises, if countries with overcapacity reroute their exports to the euro area. That is still up from a rate of around $1.026 at the start of the year, as investors have broadly shifted away from the greenback due to political and fiscal uncertainty. Higher fiscal spending and extreme weather events also risk an uptick in inflation, she said, describing the current situation as "wait and watch" but policy overall as in a "good place."

Article: Recycling the metal also consumes only 5% of the energy it takes to produce the same amount of primary aluminum through a smelter, making it more environmentally friendly, according to the International Aluminium Institute, a trade association. That has provided a windfall for some domestic producers but has pushed up costs through the supply chain, with downstream users like PepsiCo and Campbell Soup facing price hikes on everything from beverage cans to tinplate steel. The United States, which until recently exported about 2 million tonnes of scrap annually , has begun to export much less, partly because of the lack of supply but also because of diversion to feed local recycling capacity. "There is a clear incentive to export scrap from Europe to the U.S.," said Hydro's Christophersen, though he noted that volatility in the transatlantic trade environment is limiting those flows. "We're not seeing a lot of scrap exports [from Europe at the moment] because the trade environment is so volatile and are fully dependent on where Europe ends up when it comes to tariff [with] the U.S.," he added. A compelling business case Building a new recycling facility requires only about 10% of the capital expenditure and can be completed in one to two years, less than the five-to-six-year timeline for a traditional smelter.

We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support." Norris was hurt with 14:50 to go trying to tackle running back Nathan Carter. When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage as the clock continued to run. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back's midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we've all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it." Campbell and Falcons coach Raheem Morris made the decision to not finish the game. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board." Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. "We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone's eyes and see that." Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

But she agreed to stay on to help a colleague investigate why the agency's informants in the Soviet Union had "gone dark," as they say in spycraft, in 1985 and 1986. "We owed all these people who had made the sacrifice." Their investigation led them to look closely at Aldrich Ames, whom they knew as "Rick." He was the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, and knew about all of the agency's informants in the USSR. Sandra Grimes scrutinized activity logs and financial statements and noticed that three times after Ames had lunch with a Soviet embassy official in Washington, D.C., he deposited thousands into his bank account. "It didn't take a rocket scientist to add one plus one plus one." Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and pled guilty to espionage, after taking millions of dollars for his spy work for the Soviet Union. Her work was crucial in catching and stopping a Soviet agent who, the Senate Intelligence Committee said, "caused more damage to the national security of the United States than any spy in the history of the CIA."

Article: Allan Ahlberg, author of over 150 children's books including the classic “Eat Peach Pear Plum,” has died at 87 This undated photo supplied by Penguin Random House shows British author Allan Ahlberg, who has died at the age of 87. (Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

Article: A week removed from a brutal payroll report that triggered worry over a tapped consumer and a trapped Federal Reserve, the broad stock indexes are back at the cusp of all-time highs, market volatility has returned to year-to-date lows and some investors are calling off the August hurricane watch. The S & P 500's 2.4% gain last week and the Nasdaq 100's 3.7% ramp to a new record was a matter of investors staying out of danger by hiding behind their big brothers, the mega-cap giants that have long acted both as defense and aggression in this bull market. The S & P 500 added around $850 billion in market capitalization during the week, and $400 billion was kicked in by Apple alone, which went from conspicuous laggard to market redeemer after a pledge to invest an incremental $100 billion in the U.S. The acute worry prompted by last week's steep downward revisions to payroll growth since the spring was allayed by resurgent market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, abetted by a chorus of more dovish rhetoric. equity strategist Venu Krishna suggests the market by early August had grown a bit complacent toward the macroeconomic trajectory, before investors were jolted to attention by the weak July payroll report a week ago Friday. He suggests, sensibly if not surprisingly, that, "Going forward, we think equities need support from both earnings and macro to continue working at these levels, which is complicated by the still-evolving tariff backdrop and challenging August seasonality." Meantime, a dozen S & P 500 stocks fell more than 10% last week, nearly all on poorly assessed earnings or outlooks, with Eli Lilly disgorging 18%, ON Semiconductor falling 16% and digital-ad marketplace Trade Desk collapsing 37%. The severe punishment of companies missing either official forecasts or investors' informal expectations has been a popular talking point in recent months, with Bank of America calculating that companies falling short on both revenue and earnings have seen their stocks lose more than triple the average amount seen over the past 25 years. And yet, such treacherous action is scarcely visible when looking at the S & P 500, which remains in a solid uptrend, just under 6,400, having flattened out the past two weeks well above what most would view as credible support around 6,150 – which is both the pre-Liberation Day peak from February and near the 50-day moving average. Concentration risk Apollo strategist Torsten Slok, whose charts go viral (on a Wall Street scale), notes that Nvidia , at 8.2% of the S & P 500, is larger than any top-weighted stock since at least 1981 — and also likely the most expensive top index component since then on a price-to-earnings basis. It's a winner-take-most index for a winner-take-most economy, in which AI is the source of most of the investor enthusiasm and AI-related capital spending is the key marginal source of GDP growth. Granted, the equal-weighted S & P 500 over the past three years has lagged the annualized total return of the market-cap-weighted S & P 500 by seven percentage points (16.9% to 9.5%) but hey the equal-weight has returned 9.5%. The Nasdaq 100 index is just about back up to 28-times next 12 months' forecast earnings, a level only exceeded in the past two decades during the manic Covid-pandemic rally. That $420 billion in Johnson & Johnson is backed by $93 billion in 2025 revenue and an expected $26 billion in net income, not to mention a 200-year-old brand, a 3% dividend yield and one of only two triple-A-rated balance sheets left in the market. Palantir's $440 billion is perched atop just $4.1 billion in revenue this year, $1.6 billion in net income – but the company boasts one of the most profitable and fastest-growing software businesses seen in many years, if ever, and is clearly a favored partner to the current U.S. No appetite for value or defense We can similarly observe that the market is in an "Everybody wins" phase when it comes to the largest players in the AI buildout, on both the "hyperscaler" and hardware side. As for any potential value resurgence, we're not quite as deep in the trough as in 1999, and much of the value relative comeback then came from expensive growth crashing rather than cheap stocks soaring.

The government proscribed the Palestine Action group in July under the Terrorism Act of 2000, making membership of or support for the group a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. In the hours before the protest, the Metropolitan Police had issued a statement saying: "Anyone showing support for the group can expect to be arrested." Footage from the square showed officers moving among the protesters, who were mainly seated on the ground, and speaking to them before leading them away. "Officers have moved in and are making arrests." The protest comes just days after the first three people to be charged with supporting the group in England and Wales were named. When it announced the protest, Defend Our Juries said: "Together, in numbers, we will stand against UK complicity in Israel's genocide." As well as the protest by Palestine Action, two marches have been organised by Palestine Coalition and pro-Israeli group Stop the Hate and will be held on consecutive days in central London. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan warned that officers would be ready to arrest anyone showing support for Palestine Action and urged people to "consider the seriousness of that outcome."

Article: But the 162,000-square-foot former Sears space was sold to a local church, Crossroads, which has transformed 90,000 square feet of the former store into a house of worship and community hub with a traditional indoor entrance to the rest of the mall. "But Crossroads has a huge following, and they are so community driven that I think any mall in the world would be lucky to have a partner like that." It's fair to ask if a struggling mall is the right place for a church, and Matt Castleman, the pastor of Crossroads Church in Dayton, said the religious organization had its own reservations. Teenagers fan the mall after services to eat at the food court and show back up at the church with bags from stores like Claire's and Dick's Sporting Goods , Castleman said. But filling old anchors with new, niche businesses or destinations, like in the case of the Dayton Mall with its new church tenant, is precisely the type of "cross-shopping" mall landlords are seeking. The trend of repurposing empty anchors, which in some cases began a decade ago, took a long time to bear fruit, said Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, one of the largest mall landlords in the U.S. There are former Sears' locations in the CBL portfolio that were generating $7 million to $8 million a year, with newly filled, subdivided ones bringing in a combined five to six times that amount, according to Lebovitz. A variety of different businesses are filling those voids, from restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, to large retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, entertainment options like Dave & Buster's, or hotels. "Gen Z loves the mall; they love the experience of the mall and being in person with each other at malls," said Kirsten Lee, executive vice president of luxury leasing at Brookfield Properties. That has helped to increase the amount of crossover shopping, Lee said, with customers who may hit the lanes for some games of bowling and then go look for a new shirt. "Now we are starting to see enclosed malls do it." Hottovy credits much of the success to non-traditional anchor selections, with malls incorporating a variety of tenants into their mix. "Malls are absolutely places we are interested in being a part of," said Jason Stryker, head of real estate and development for Barnes & Noble, which has been lauded for its turnaround. The company is considering adding 10 more enclosed mall locations this year and is actively exploring approximately a dozen now-vacant Forever 21 sites, which are often sprawling and sometimes two stories high, making it a good fit for a Barnes & Noble layout, Stryker said. "We like to be around stores where people will cross-shop," Stryker said, adding that Barnes & Noble can be especially appealing to malls because "We really don't compete with any other retailer there." Developers point to something intangible that malls capture, nostalgia, and they may be onto something. "Most Gen X and millennials spent their adolescent years making memories in malls – going to the food court with their friends, smelling all the lotions or perfumes at a store, or just generally hanging out chatting," said Dr.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. "I have so many people who come to me and say to me, 'I love your music, I want to give, but I'm sorry, I don't carry cash,'" said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. There's no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. "I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, 'Thank you,' because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away," Deitz said. "But then people that didn't pay see those people walk away, and they go, 'Well, I guess it's acceptable to walk away.'" For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. "People would stop and talk to us." Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. "You might think that it's worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you're getting cash out of your wallet and you're fumbling around for change." But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year.

Article: LONDON -- On the heels of Israel's security cabinet approving plans to occupy Gaza City, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said "this further escalation will result in more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction," according to a statement released Friday morning. "It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-State solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination." A Palestinian boy carries a stroller at the site of a morning Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, Aug. Mahmoud Issa/Reuters European Union Council President Antonio Costa strongly urged the Israeli government to reconsider its decision to take over Gaza City, saying it will only worsen the situation in Gaza. "Such an operation -- together with the continued illegal expansion of settlements in the West Bank, the massive destruction in Gaza, the blockade of humanitarian aid, and the spread of famine -- not only violates the agreement with the EU announced by the High Representative on July 19 but also undermines fundamental principles of international law and universal values," Costa said in a post on social media. Germany, one of Israel's closest allies, announced Friday it will suspend the exports of arms to Israel that could be used in the Gaza Strip "until further notice." Germany said the "release of hostages and purposeful negotiations on a ceasefire are our top priority." "The even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved last night by the Israeli Security Cabinet, makes it increasingly difficult, from the German government's perspective, to see how these goals are to be achieved," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement. Israel's military will "take control" of Gaza City under a new plan approved by the Premier's security cabinet, touching off a wave of criticism from both inside and outside the country. Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images In response to Israel's plans to take over Gaza City, Hamas claimed this was the reason Israel withdrew from the last round of negotiations, and that they had been "on the verge of reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange." Hamas called Israel's latest plan a new war crime, saying the Israeli government "do not care about the fate of their captives," and that they are sacrificing them. Hamas reaffirmed "maximum flexibility and positivity" toward a ceasefire, but warned Israel the current plan "will come at a high cost and will not be a walk in the park." Family members of hostages and other protesters gathered in front of the building where the Israeli cabinet was in session to protest Netanyahu's current proposal to occupy all of Gaza, calling the move a "death sentence" for the remaining hostages in a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters. Now it's necessary to do the one thing the government hasn't yet done - put a comprehensive deal on the table that will bring them all home together," said Anat Angrest, mother of hostage Matan Angrest. "The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will prepare for the takeover of Gaza City while ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones." Turk, however, said that the potential escalation will only lead to more problems in the region. Palestinians arbitrarily detained by Israel must also be immediately and unconditionally released." Palestinians inspect the site of a morning Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, August 8, 2025. Mahmoud Issa/Reuters In a Fox News interview earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said repeatedly that he does not want to "govern Gaza," but he wants to "hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening" Israel. Hamas, responding to the Fox News interview, said in a statement that "Netanyahu's statements represent a blatant reversal of the negotiation process and clearly expose the real motives behind his withdrawal from the latest round of talks, despite us nearing a final agreement." On Sunday, an Israeli official told ABC News that Netanyahu was pushing to expand the military operation in Gaza on the grounds that he felt Hamas is not interested in reaching a new ceasefire deal under which surviving hostages could be released. We are not in the business of interpreting statements from foreign governments when and if they're made." "We do remain focused on freeing the hostages, including the remains of two Americans, and ensuring that Hamas never rules Gaza again," Bruce said.

Article: Eleven more die from malnutrition in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry says 5 minutes ago Share Save Emir Nader BBC News in Jerusalem Cachella Smith BBC News in London Share Save EPA Gazans carry aid packages from a food distribution point in Zikim in the northern Gaza Strip A further 11 deaths resulting from malnutrition have been reported in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Deaths continue to rise amid reports that a deadline of 7 October 2025 has been set for residents to evacuate Gaza City following the announcement of a controversial Israeli plan to take control of the area. The new plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet and detailed on Friday, lists five "principles" for ending the war in Gaza, with one being "taking security control of the territory". The plan has been met with criticism from world leaders as well as fierce opposition from some within Israel, including from military officials and the families of hostages still being held in Gaza who fear for their safety. The US has been less critical - with Donald Trump saying earlier in the week that it was "pretty much up to Israel" whether to fully occupy the Gaza Strip. Israeli media reports that the government has set a two-month deadline before a military siege of Gaza City to begin on 7 October 2025, the two-year anniversary of the beginning of the war. Within those two months, Israel plans to forcibly displace the estimated one million Palestinians living in Gaza City, roughly half the number of people living in the entirety of the territory. Many living there now have already been displaced multiple times through the war and are living in tents or the ruins of buildings that have been partially destroyed by Israeli air strikes. Israeli media reports that the military would move the population towards al-Mawasi, a vast tent encampment in the south of Gaza, already home to thousands of Palestinians suffering from an absence of basic facilities and sanitation. The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians have been killed seeking food since late May, when a new US and Israeli-backed organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) set up aid distribution sites.

District Court via AP) In this image from surveillance video obtained by the Louisiana State Police, Trooper Kasha Domingue confronts Clifton “Scotty” Dilley in Baton Rouge, La., early July 10, 2018. -- Louisiana authorities have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed from the waist down after a trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge and then falsely reported it as a Taser discharge. The settlement reached last month is among the largest of its kind in state history and resolves a federal lawsuit by Clifton “Scotty” Dilley, whose injuries confined him to a wheelchair when he was 19. The terms of the settlement, which were not made public, were provided to The Associated Press by a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to disclose them and spoke on condition of anonymity. State police fired Trooper Kasha Domingue after determining she shot Dilley “without any reliable justification,” failed to activate her body-worn camera and gave inconsistent accounts that were contradicted by surveillance video. Dilley said he hopes the “case will effect change within the state police that will keep this from ever happening again.” An attorney for Domingue, Louis Oubre, declined to comment, as did the state Attorney General's Office. Baton Rouge agreed in 2021 to pay $4.5 million to the children of Alton Sterling, a Black man whose fatal shooting by police was captured on video and sparked widespread anger and protests. One internal report said she “struggled from the onset of the class, both physically and mentally.” The Justice Department alluded to Domingue in its findings on the state police's widespread use of excessive force.

Article: "Companion animals, and especially cats, are 100% a public health risk in terms of the risk of zoonotic transmission to people," said virologist Angela Rasmussen, PhD, who studies disease progression in emerging viruses at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Veterinarian Jane Sykes, PhD, who specializes in infectious diseases in cats and dogs at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, said people should not assume it's bird flu if their cat is sick -- even if their animal spends time outdoors or eats a raw diet. The American Veterinary Medical Association says the risk of H5N1 spilling over from a pet to a person is "considered extremely low, but not zero." State and local public health agencies, including those in Los Angeles County and Washington state, have issued similar warnings against raw food diets for pets. Concerns for human health are partly why the FDA announced last month it is now requiring cat and dog food companies to update their safety plans to protect against bird flu. This came after the Oregon Department of Agriculture discovered a cat that was "strictly an indoor cat" had contracted H5N1 and died after consuming a frozen turkey product made by the raw pet food brand Northwest Naturals. It stated that "tests confirmed a genetic match between the virus in the raw and frozen pet food and the infected cat." Northwest Naturals voluntarily recalled that batch of its frozen turkey-based product. The company told KFF Health News and NPR that the recall involved "a small product run" and that it has concerns about the accuracy of the Oregon Agriculture Department's testing. Los Angeles County's public health department said five cats from two households tested positive for bird flu after drinking unpasteurized raw milk from the Raw Farm dairy in California's Central Valley. Raw Farm voluntarily recalled its milk and cream after retail products tested positive for H5N1, but it denies any food safety issues, calling the concern "a political issue." Veterinarians also warn pet owners not to allow cats unsupervised time outside as there's the risk of them getting H5N1 by interacting with other animals that might carry the disease. There isn't a lot of research on transmission of bird flu from companion animals like cats or dogs to humans, though Rasmussen agreed it's definitely a concern: The more infections you have in animals, "the more your luck is potentially going to run out." Most people who have caught H5N1 are agricultural workers who had direct contact with infected poultry or cattle. And the more people who catch H5N1, the more likely it would adapt to be more efficient, said Suresh Kuchipudi, PhD, MVSc, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health, where he researches zoonotic diseases. Sometimes the results are benign, though it was likely a reassortment that involved an avian virus that led to the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people. That includes limiting a pet's exposure to H5N1 by not feeding them raw food or unpasteurized milk, and trying to keep them from interacting with animals like rodents and wild birds that could be infected with the virus.

"I felt like I just completely lost control of the situation." Kids typically have a different relationship with phones than adults do: They have a higher tendency to overuse social media and watch videos for hours on end, according to Michael Robb, head of research at Common Sense Media. This can cause problems with their sleep, physical and mental health, and shorten their attention spans — all making them less likely to develop into happy, successful adults, Yale University psychologist Laurie Santos told CNBC Make It in October 2023. Changing your habit means making a conscious effort — first to put your phone down when you've just picked it up, and then to avoid picking it up at all, Robbins said. "You cannot yell at your kids or expect your kids to police themselves [and] have balance if you're not modeling it." Specifically, Robbins stopped keeping her phone on her person after work, while walking around the house and while sleeping, she said. Maybe they were texting their friends, for example — theoretically a better use of technology than mindlessly scrolling through social media, which can damage your brain's "executive function," psychologist Gloria Mark said in April.

The crew of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov spent their time on the station conducting more than 200 science experiments that helped prepare humans for exploration beyond low-Earth orbit that included material studies and experiments to better understand physiological and psychological changes to the human body. NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, along with JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, will spend roughly six months on the orbiting lab conducting science experiments and maintenance. In 2020, the private company began ferrying astronauts to the station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program, ending a reliance on Russia for rides to the station after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.

Article: Vance and Lammy host Ukraine talks ahead of US-Russia summit It is understood the meeting will take place at Chevening and was called at the request of the US Trump earlier signalled Ukraine may have to cede territory to end the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Zelensky has stressed he will make no territorial concessions to Russia ahead of a summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin next week to discuss the future of the war. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer had a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and said they agreed it would be a "vital forum to discuss progress towards securing a just and lasting peace". Saturday's meeting is understood to be taking place at Chevening, Lammy's official country residence in Kent, where Vance and his family are currently staying, and to have been called at the request of the US. Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Saturday that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier", and reiterated that Ukraine must be involved in any solution for peace. "We are ready, together with President Trump, together with all partners, to work for a real, and most importantly, lasting peace - a peace that will not collapse because of Moscow's wishes." This is what Ukraine, and many European allies, were always worried about - Trump and Putin trying to do a deal without Ukraine present. The BBC's US partner CBS News, citing a senior White House official, reported that it remains possible Zelensky, could end up being involved in the meeting between Putin and Trump some way, as planning for the Friday meeting is still fluid. But there is little evidence that Ukraine is willing to accept a peace at any price - much less one that will be forced on it without its voice being heard.

Article: President Donald Trump suggested a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories.” Zelenskyy said Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” WATCH: Trump suggests ‘swapping’ Ukraine and Russia territories ahead of meeting with Putin The remarks came after Trump said Friday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. In a statement posted to Telegram, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s territorial integrity, enshrined in the constitution, must be nonnegotiable, and emphasized that lasting peace must include Ukraine’s voice at the table. Ukrainian officials had previously told The Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine’s inability to regain lost territories militarily. The summit The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there’s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. “It seems entirely logical for our delegation to fly across the Bering Strait simply, and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Saturday in a statement posted to the Kremlin’s news channel. WATCH: Trump will meet with Putin in Alaska for talks on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine In his comments to reporters at the White House Friday, Trump gave no details on the “swapping of territories.” Analysts, including some close to the Kremlin, have suggested that Russia could offer to give up territory it controls outside of the four regions it claims to have annexed. Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the AP that the “symbology” of holding the summit in Alaska was clear, and that the location “naturally favors Russia.” “It’s easy to imagine Putin making the point. … We once had this territory and we gave it to you, therefore Ukraine had this territory and now should give it to us,” he said, referring to the 1867 transaction known as the Alaska Purchase when Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million. “It may not be capitulation, but it would be a loss,” said Ihor Usatenko, a 67-year-old pensioner, who said he would consider ceding territory “on condition for compensation and, possibly, some reparations.” Anastasia Yemelianova, 31, said she was torn: “Honestly, I have two answers to that question. “But seeing all these deaths and knowing that my mother is now living in Nikopol under shelling and my father is fighting, I want all this to end as soon as possible.” Others, like Svitlana Dobrynska, whose son died fighting, rejected outright concessions but supported halting combat to save lives. “We don’t have the opportunity to launch an offensive to recapture our territories,” the 57-year-old pensioner said, “But to prevent people from dying, we can simply stop military operations, sign some kind of agreement, but not give up our territories.” Ultimatums and sanctions Exasperated that Putin did not heed his calls to stop bombing Ukrainian cities, Trump had moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. Russia and Ukraine trade attacks On Saturday, two people died and 16 were wounded when a Russian drone hit a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, regional Gov.

The president said, "If you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." While a temporary electronics exemption from earlier this year keeps Apple safe from the worst of the "reciprocal" tariffs that went into effect Thursday, there is no telling how long that exemption will last. With Trump off its back for now, the company must seize the opportunity to remove the other concerns about its stock by clarifying its artificial intelligence strategy and shoring up threats to its high-margin services business.

Article: The Federal Reserve's vice chair of supervision, Michelle Bowman, on Saturday said recent weak job data underscores her concerns about labor market fragility and strengthens her confidence in her own forecast that three interest-rate cuts will likely be appropriate this year. Most Fed officials have been more cautious about lower rates, given the potential they see that the Trump administration's tariffs could disrupt progress on getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% goal. "Taking action at last week's meeting would have proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a further weakening in economic activity," Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association. "My Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been consistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my view." The Fed has three remaining policy meetings scheduled for this year, in September, October and December. Economists typically point to 100,000 monthly job gains as being consistent with a steady-state labor market, though with big reductions in immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January that number is likely lower. Bowman repeated her longstanding view that large revisions make her cautious about taking too much of a signal from job-market reports, but on Saturday she said she sees "the latest news on economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the employment side of our dual mandate." She said recent inflation data has also boosted her confidence that the Trump administration's tariffs will not lead to persistent inflation. Excluding increases in goods prices related to tariffs, underlying inflation is "much closer" to the Fed's 2% target than the official reading of 2.8% in June, based on the 12-month change in the core personal consumption expenditures price index. Easing policy gradually from its current moderately restrictive stance would "reduce the chance that the Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further."

Gbagbo and Thiam joined forces earlier this year to challenge incumbent President Alassane Ouattara. Seen as Ouattara's main rival, he has been barred from running on the grounds that he was still a French citizen at the time he declared his candidacy, even though he later renounced his French nationality. Over the past decade, groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have been spreading from the Sahel region into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Togo and Benin.

Article: LONDON (AP) — British police said they arrested more than 200 people in central London on Saturday as supporters of a recently banned pro-Palestinian group intentionally flouted the law as part of their effort to force the government to reconsider the ban. That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Daring police to arrest them More than 500 protesters filled the square outside the Houses of Parliament on Saturday, many daring police to arrest them by displaying signs reading “I oppose genocide. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. Why the group is being banned The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. Busy weekend of protests The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana) DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel's decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while little appeared to change immediately on the ground in the territory shattered by 22 months of war. Health officials said that 11 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead, and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours as the new criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food and other supplies to reach people in the besieged enclave. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Families of hostages were rallying again to pressure the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid new fears over the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. She called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel's decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation," endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel's decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel's plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. “This way is not for humans, it is for animals,” said one man at the scene, Mahmoud Hawila, who said he was stabbed while trying to secure an airdropped package. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn.

Article: Sturgeon denies 'conspiracy to destroy' mentor Salmond 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save Getty Images In her new memoir Nicola Sturgeon writes that she and Salmond formed "one of the most successful partnerships in modern British politics" Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to destroy her mentor Alex Salmond. In 2020 Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." The ex-SNP leader and Alba Party founder died of a heart attack in North Macedonia in October last year, aged 69. "It felt to me", writes Sturgeon, that Salmond "would have rather destroyed the SNP than see it succeed without him." She adds: "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy - government, police, Crown Office. "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all." In the memoir, entitled Frankly, Sturgeon describes the moment when Salmond first informed her of the allegations against him. Getty Images In March 2020, Salmond was cleared after a two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh of 13 sexual offence charges, including attempted rape At first, she says, Salmond had appeared "upset and mortified" and had "effectively admitted the substance of one of the complaints," calling it a "misunderstanding" for which he had apologised. However, Sturgeon goes on, it quickly became evident that her predecessor as first minister wanted her "to intervene and to stop the investigation in its tracks or divert it into some kind of siding." Her refusal to do so, she says, "made the break-up of one of the most successful partnerships in modern British politics all but inevitable." "I had to face the fact that he was determined to destroy me. "In Alex's narrative, he wasn't just a victim any more," writes Sturgeon, "he was now a vindicated victim." It later emerged that messages had been exchanged between women complainers - a Scots law term for someone alleging that they are a victim of crime - and also between SNP staff members. PA Media Alex Salmond led his party - and close colleagues John Swinney, Nicola Sturgeon and Michael Russell - into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 Rather, she said, the messages were between loyal supporters expressing "deep shock" and "women who considered themselves victims of his behaviour" who were "seeking support and comfort from each other." Sturgeon accuses Salmond of trying to "distort and weaponise" genuine shock or trauma in a way that was "truly disgraceful," adding "it strikes at the heart of why I find it so hard to forgive him". "It would then have required criminal collusion between them, senior ministers and civil servants, the police and the Crown." This, she says, was "a fabrication, the invention of a man who wasn't prepared to reflect honestly on his own conduct." Reflecting on Salmond's death, while attending a conference in the North Macedonian city of Ohrid, Sturgeon writes that the emotions she felt suggested she had not come to terms with their estrangement.

Pawol’s rise to make MLB history came 28 years after the NBA gender barrier for game officials was broken and 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) FILE - Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, takes a seat for an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, in Washington, June 25, 2025. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move. At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that “the latest labor market data reinforce my view” that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs “will not present a persistent shock to inflation” and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. A fear is that Trump's tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called “stagflation,” where the economy stagnates but inflation is high.

The hosts were left to rue a top-order collapse to 55-6 - including Australia star Steve Smith falling for just three - as Bairstow was starved of the strike, facing just 18 of the first 50 balls of their pursuit of 164 to win. Chris Green contributed 32 not out from 21 balls in a stunning partnership of 100 from just 53 balls with Bairstow, who whacked six fours and six sixes in his destructive knock. The wicketkeeper had 28 from 27 balls before a remarkable acceleration that started with 21 runs scored from five balls of Wood, leaving the equation still an unlikely 70 off 30, which proved just enough for Spirit. Warner whacked eight fours and two sixes as he found support from England's Jamie Smith, who added 26 from 14 balls, while Warner's fellow Australian Ashton Turner chipped in with 24.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) YEREVAN, Armenia -- Residents and politicians in Armenia and Azerbaijan responded Saturday with cautious hope — and skepticism in some cases — after their leaders signed a U.S.-brokered agreement at the White House aimed at ending decades of hostilities. Among the agreement's provisions is the creation of a new transit corridor, dubbed the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” highlighting a changing geopolitical landscape amid declining Russian influence in the South Caucasus. Ali Karimli, head of the opposition People’s Front of Azerbaijan Party, wrote on Facebook that the signing of the agreement “has undoubtedly brought Azerbaijan and Armenia significantly closer to peace,” and noted that it delivered “another blow … to Russia’s influence in the South Caucasus,” while deepening ties with the U.S. Arif Hajili, chairman of Azerbaijani opposition party Musavat, said he believed that “the most positive aspect of the initialing in Washington was the absence of Russia from the process.” He said lasting stability in the region hinges on the continual dwindling of Russian power, which “depends on the outcome of the Russian‑Ukrainian war.” Hajili also warned of lingering challenges, including Armenia's economic dependence on Russia and some 2 million Azerbaijanis living in Russia. “Until now, all major routes have passed through Georgia, leaving Armenia sidelined and economically limited.” Others were skeptical that peace could be achieved, and expressed discontent with the terms of the agreement.

Article: Long before President Trump harnessed a working-class coalition to win last November’s election, leaders of the nation’s biggest labor unions, in public and private, were warning Democrats that those voters could defect. And if Democrats regain the ground they’ve lost with blue-collar voters, many of whom are union members, it could help leaders with their own struggles, including flagging membership and criticism that they are losing touch with everyday workers. Trump among blue-collar voters last year was the culmination of a trend in recent elections: Democrats gained votes in wealthy, white enclaves, while Republicans earned new support in working-class regions and among Hispanic and Black voters, raising questions about Democrats’ longstanding identity as the defender of working people. Union leaders, who mostly endorsed Kamala Harris even as many of their members scoffed at her candidacy, now find themselves trying to strike a delicate balance, maintaining support for Democratic candidates while not alienating members who voted for Mr.

Article: As someone who’s had another person’s kidney filtering my blood for more than five years, I don’t think I’ve been paranoid to worry that a health secretary so openly hostile to 20th-century medical innovations would eventually decide that people living happily after a transplant is a problem that warrants his solution. That’s why it was so frightening to read what Kennedy posted on X Monday: “Under my leadership, [the Department of Health and Human Services] is overhauling the organ transplant system,” he wrote. “We’ve exposed gross negligence, launched sweeping reforms, and will decertify any organization that violates the sanctity of human life.” Kennedy’s post and the news interviews and press release that preceded it focus on a horrible scandal involving Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates (which, after a merger, is now called Network for Hope) that was exposed last year. Over a four-year period, according to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, more than five dozen people who were on life support and not expected to recover nearly had their organs removed while they were still alive. The newspaper, quoting his medical records, said that as a medical team was preparing Hoover for organ retrieval in 2021, “he cried, pulled his knees to his chest and shook his head.” The newspaper said two former employees of the procurement organization said higher-ups in their organization pressured the doctor to proceed with the retrieval but that the doctor refused. “Network for Hope looks forward to working collaboratively with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and encourages the development of policies that support the betterment of the organ transplant system as a whole.” That same day, after a congressional hearing on organ procurement agencies, Massa released another statement: “We hold ourselves to the highest standards and are committed to ongoing improvement as we carry out the sacred responsibility of honoring each individual’s decision to become an organ donor.” The allegation that a procurement agency would push a doctor to remove organs from someone who was still viable is the stuff of nightmares. A press release issued by his office at the end of July calls out the offenses of “a major organ procurement organization” but doesn’t immediately point out that the scandal was specific to Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates. The first response I saw to Kennedy’s X post suggests that all such organs are improperly removed, that there are no cadaverous donors and that all organs come from people who are alive but medically immobilized. That’s absurd, but it’s no more absurd than Kennedy’s assertion that Black people’s immune systems are so strong we should be on a different vaccine schedule, his insistence that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS or his argument that Covid was “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and spare Jews and Chinese people.

Article: But based on what we know so far, the efforts would fail to address the real problems with the flow of aid into Gaza — and could provide political cover for Israel as it carries on with its assault on civilian life in the territory. Huckabee also said the sites would operate for longer periods of time; while sites in some cases have opened for mere minutes before announcing they’re out of food, Huckabee said that in the future they could operate for “as much as 24 hours a day.” This would be an incremental improvement, but akin to placing a Band-Aid on a gaping wound — while also stabbing the patient elsewhere. It reduced primary distribution of food to just four sites, and three out of its four initial sites are in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, making it hard for much of the population to access food. As I explained in a recent piece, GHF sites create a horrifying dilemma for Gazans by forcing them to choose between starving or risking being shot: Close to a thousand people have been shot and killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations. official to describe the new system.) Humanitarian and famine experts say that the program can’t possibly feed everyone in the territory and that it also ‘humiliates and undermines’ the population. But The New York Times, citing two senior Israeli military officials and two other Israelis involved in the matter, reported in July that “the Israeli military never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations” and that the U.N. (A White House spokesperson claimed no State Department official had seen the study and said it “was likely produced by a deep state operative.”) What we do know is that a surge in starvation-related deaths in Gaza came after Israel paused aid and instituted the GHF. Last week, Huckabee visited the Gaza Strip alongside Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and called GHF’s operations an “incredible feat.” Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News, “It was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military.” (NBC News also reported that “on the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid.”) The Trump administration is clearly willing to airbrush and downplay the harsh realities on the ground, which should give us reason to doubt that it’ll hold a high bar when trying to allow more food into the enclave. If the Trump administration were serious about helping Gaza, then it would pressure Israel to end a war that hundreds of ex-Israeli security officials have said no longer serves any military purpose against Hamas and call for an end to a blockade that treats civilians as targets of war.

Article: Among the many issues that have plagued the Internal Revenue Service in recent months is the revolving door at the commissioner’s office: Between January and May, the tax agency went through five different chiefs in five months. Exactly three weeks ago, Donald Trump — who picked Long despite his complete lack of qualifications — held a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for the Missouri Republican in the Oval Office. It was a provocative move in its own right: Since Watergate, presidents from both parties have taken a hands-off attitude toward the IRS, treating it as an apolitical and largely independent agency. The New York Times reported: President Trump is removing Billy Long from his job leading the Internal Revenue Service just two months after he was confirmed as commissioner, according to four people familiar with the matter. The Times’ report, which has been verified by NBC News, added that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — who ostensibly already has a full-time job — will serve as acting IRS commissioner for a while. For those keeping score, Senate Republicans confirmed Long on June 12, and he formally took the office on June 16, which means he lasted just 53 days — or in the parlance, roughly five Scaramuccis. What’s more, The New York Times reported late last year that Long has a problematic record of peddling a pandemic-era tax credit that the IRS warned was “a magnet for fraud.” Long’s record was so controversial that Senate Democrats suggested he face a criminal investigation. As for why the president, who's appeared eager to sic the IRS on his perceived political foes, decided to oust Long so quickly, the story is still coming into focus.

Article: Though gerrymandering is nearly as old as the United States, Trump is the first president to attempt a nationwide effort to secure his party control of the House by gerrymandering immediately before the election. In the context of the Congress and Supreme Court’s surrender to Trump and his record of election denial, this is best understood as an effort to secure what can only be characterized as autocratic control over all of American government. Kathy Hochul said the effort was “nothing less than a legal insurrection” and that “if Republicans are willing to rewrite the rules to give themselves an advantage, then they’re leaving us no choice. JB Pritzker has probably been the most aggressive of the Democratic governors supporting the Texas legislators, promising not only to house them but also to shield them from potential arrest by federal agents. It thus seems that the Texas gerrymander effort and the resulting flight of the state’s Democratic lawmakers may lead to a face-off between a Democratic-controlled state government, or several of them, and federal officials helping to indirectly carry out Trump’s gerrymandering directive. It is impossible to predict how all this will be resolved, but there is considerable reason to think these states will not abjectly surrender like congressional Republicans or the Roberts Court.

Article: Kathy Hochul are crafting plans to fight back against President Donald Trump’s push for a radical gerrymandering scheme in Texas, which would help rig the 2026 midterm elections in favor of the GOP. As The New York Times reported, Republican lawmakers released a draft map last week that “all but erased three urban Democratic seats and forced two other incumbents in South Texas into more Republican terrain.” Abbott called a special session of the Legislature to vote the map into law, but Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum and freeze the process. As UCLA law professor Richard Hasen wrote for MSNBC, this effort at an additional mid-decade gerrymandering effort is a naked power grab: “The Department of Justice sent a laughably weak letter to Texas claiming that the state had to redistrict because its earlier redistricting plans were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” he wrote. Here’s how that would work, according to NBC News: Newsom hopes to work with the Democratic-dominated Legislature starting this month to set up a special election for a statewide ballot measure on Nov. And as NBC News reports, “any new House map would be constrained by the Voting Rights Act, as well as the governor’s office and the Legislature, which would need to greenlight it.” Former California Gov. New York also has its own independent redistricting commission, and NBC News reports that “changing the redistricting process must move forward as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment — a lengthy and arduous exercise that probably wouldn’t lead to new congressional maps until the 2028 election cycle, even if Texas acts before the upcoming midterms.” Some other Democratic governors, including JB Pritzker of Illinois, haven’t ruled out their own retaliatory gerrymandering efforts. Democratic voters have been expressing sharp disapproval of their own party for its meekness in the face of Republican extremism, and clamoring for a party willing to fight more fiercely to protect democracy. And it’s not even clear that such efforts would be politically “necessary”: historical trends suggest Democrats could have a wave election in 2026, and, as Hasen notes, Texas’ redistricting ambitions could also backfire by diluting some Republican districts.

Article: On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he is ordering the Commerce Department to work on a new census that would exclude “persons who are illegally in our Country illegally.” It’s often difficult to know from a social media post what Trump intends. There, Democratic state legislators have fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum needed to adopt a new congressional map, with the intended effect to tilt the table slightly toward the GOP in what will most likely be a challenging 2026 election environment. And this is before Republican-allied organizations like business and law enforcement groups pressure Republican members of Congress to provide reliable population counts that would be jeopardized by the redirected resources needed to conduct a slap-dash census. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly states that congressional seats are to be apportioned by the “whole number of persons in each State.” Trump’s directive will be litigated, which poses yet another logistical barrier. If I were to guess what would happen, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will order the Census Bureau to explore adding a question to the 2030 census asking for people’s legal status in the country. In this scenario, the legal questions about using the data for apportionment and redistricting would be cans to be kicked down the road until the next president releases the population counts of the 2030 census. Advocacy groups representing immigrant communities would still most likely file lawsuits, though, alleging the addition of the status question negatively affects participation in the decennial census, thereby undermining the federal government’s Fourteenth Amendment mandate.

Article: His claim that these vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu“ represents a fundamental misunderstanding of vaccinology that could cost lives in future pandemics. According to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unvaccinated individuals had 53 times the risk of death compared to those who had been fully vaccinated during the Delta wave in 2021. A New England Journal of Medicine study analyzing over 6 million Covid cases found that protection against death remained above 90% and remarkably durable, even as protection against infection declined. As vaccine expert Paul Offit stated in December 2020: “All you want to do is keep people out of the hospital and keep them out of the morgue and I think this vaccine can certainly do that.” Even then, before vaccines were widely available, experts understood the real goal. The scientists who developed mRNA vaccine technology won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine for enabling “the development of effective mRNA vaccines against Covid-19” during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.

Article: 7 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.” Here’s a headline you might not have expected from the Los Angeles Times: “ICE arrests plummet in L.A., data show.” Over the past month, immigration arrests in the seven counties around Los Angeles have fallen to about half of what they were the previous month — and experts say there’s a simple reason for that. Last month, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop arresting suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their race, ethnicity, language and the type of work they do — otherwise known as racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security suggested that this raid was targeting MS-13 gang members, but, as the Times noted, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs. Local officials in Los Angeles have said Wednesday’s operation looks a lot like the kind of racial profiling raids that the courts explicitly told ICE they could no longer conduct in Southern California. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, questioned the federal government’s claim that the immigrants targeted in this raid were “gang members” and asked authorities to share any evidence they had to prove so. In a new court filing, they asked the Supreme Court to overturn that judge’s order and let them please go back to profiling as many brown, Spanish-speaking day laborers as they want. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” That is a pretty unbelievable statement.

(And yes, it is much anticipated by me, my siblings and my millennial cohort.) Lohan’s comedic timing, her magnetic chemistry with Curtis and the fact that everyone from the original cast has returned have all garnered buzz.

Article: District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong said the government can’t rely on the following factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence at a particular location, such as a bus stop, day laborer pickup area or agricultural site; or one’s type of work. Approving the factors laid out by Frimpong, the panel observed that apparent Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity has limited relevance in this context, because large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have such physical characteristics, especially in central California. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that “in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” Sauer complained that immigration agents can’t detain people based on those factors “even after encountering someone who speaks only Spanish and works as a day laborer at a worksite that has been cited 30 times for hiring illegal aliens as day laborers.” As the administration has done throughout President Donald Trump’s second term, Sauer casts the latest litigation as yet another instance of the justices needing to check their lower court colleagues. “When lower courts have tried to stymie other areas of immigration enforcement with unlawful, blunderbuss injunctions, this Court has not hesitated to stay those orders,” he wrote, citing recent examples of the high court siding with the administration (over dissent from Democratic-appointed justices). Against that backdrop, Sauer is pleading with the justices to free the administration from what he called the “straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.” How the court handles the request could indicate whether the justices agree with that dramatic framing, or whether they see that claimed confinement as a consequence of the Constitution rather than defiance of it.

Article: Three weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tried to discredit Donald Trump’s Russia scandal and started throwing around words like “treason,” the conspiratorial DNI has certainly succeeded in generating some conversation. On the one hand, Republicans and conservative media outlets have seized on Gabbard’s accusations as proof that the entire controversy surrounding the president and Russia’s efforts in support of his 2016 candidacy is a “hoax.” On the other hand, every independent analysis of Gabbard’s findings have pointed in the opposite direction: There was no “hoax”; the underlying scandal remains real; and the DNI’s claims are “ludicrous.” Officials from Democratic and Republican administrations urged the public to recognize Gabbard’s conspiracy theories as obvious nonsense, while intelligence officials launched a behind-the-scenes effort to discourage the DNI from even releasing her discredited claims in the first place. “What is that irrefutable evidence for our viewers tonight?” Gabbard responded by pointing to a National Security Council meeting, held in December 2016 — after Trump was elected and during the presidential transition process — that Obama called to discuss Russia’s operation. Not ‘if,’ but ‘how.’ And this was the beginning of this manufactured intelligence assessment where they knowingly wrote things in this assessment that were false, and they knew they were false. It was discussed in some detail in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee’s report, and as Media Matters’ Matt Gertz explained, the GOP-led panel didn’t find anything remarkable about Obama’s instructions. On the contrary, the committee reviewed the assessment that Obama sought and concluded that it was “coherent and well-constructed,” featuring “proper analytic tradecraft,” and that its authors experienced “no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.” But what about Gabbard’s claim that officials were told to put together an intelligence assessment that detailed “how,” not “if,” Russia targeted the election? Put another way, Gabbard appeared on Fox News — a network where she used to work as a paid contributor — and was asked to support her claims about “irrefutable” evidence. On the surface, it might not seem especially surprising that the national intelligence director has struggled to bolster her own baseless conspiracy theories, but let’s not forget that a great many Republican officials are heavily invested in the idea that Gabbard knows what she’s talking about.

Article: She always does.” Three months later, NBC News reported: Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. The probe is focused on whether James’ office caused a deprivation of legal rights under the color of law through its civil suits against Trump and his businesses as well as the National Rifle Association, these people said. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers’ rights.” In case anyone needs a refresher, it’s worth taking a moment to review how we arrived at this point. The civil case was rather devastating: The state attorney general’s office pointed to more than 200 instances of alleged fraud over 10 years, and announced that it was seeking civil penalties against the Republican and his business. On the contrary, in April, Trump’s federal housing director wrote a “criminal referral” letter about James to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, both of whom used to represent Trump. The news comes just days after Trump’s attorney general directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials, which came on the heels of news that the Trump administration had also launched criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, two longtime targets of the president. (Disclosure: Brennan is a paid contributor to MSNBC and NBC News.) Trump has also signed first-of-their-kind executive orders seeking investigations into two former officials — Christopher Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, a former high-ranking Department of Homeland Security official — whom he now sees as enemies. Weeks later, Trump broke new ground again by directing the Justice Department to launch a wide-ranging investigation into Joe Biden and officials in the Democrat’s administration, based on Republican conspiracy theories about the former president’s mental health. Two weeks ago, the official White House social media account published a weird item with just six words of text: “They came after the wrong man.” The sentence appeared alongside a large image featuring the words, “I was the hunted — NOW I’M THE HUNTER,” attributed to Trump. The New York Times, assessing Trump’s intensifying campaign of retribution, reported a couple of weeks ago, “This is what Washington thought retribution would look like.” The report added: Repeatedly in his first term, Mr.

That the president and his team appear to be brazenly weaponizing federal law enforcement is a scandal unto itself, but in case the developments weren’t quite provocative enough, NBC News also reported: U.S. In May, Trump said the Missouri Republican would lead the Justice Department’s new “Weaponization Working Group” — tackling a problem that exists only in the minds of Republican conspiracy theorists — and serve as the DOJ’s new pardon attorney, succeeding Elizabeth Oyer, who was fired in March allegedly after she refused to sign off on a plan to restore actor Mel Gibson’s gun rights. A few days later, Martin announced at a press conference that he intended to use his new platform to “name” and “shame” individuals the Justice Department determines it cannot charge with crimes. According to Martin, his working group will take steps to smear these Americans publicly anyway — which, as an NBC News report noted, “would amount to a major departure from longstanding Justice Department protocols.” A month later, Martin declared that he’s also investigating Joe Biden’s clemency actions, pursuing a different Republican conspiracy theory. Now, evidently, Bondi has made Martin a “special attorney” (not to be confused with a special counsel) who’ll investigate at least two of the Democrats who’ve been repeatedly singled out by Trump. Trump, the future vice president said at the time, is “not a vengeful guy.” Shortly after the election, Trump appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and suggested vengeance wasn’t part of his plans for a second term. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said, adding, “Retribution will be through success.” The Republican president echoed the point during his second inaugural address, declaring, “Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents.” I have some bad news for anybody who believed any of these claims.

Article: As part of the incumbent president’s policy, there isn’t just a ban on transgender Americans volunteering to put their lives on the line for their country, there’s also an effort to identify transgender Americans who are already serving — and kick them out of the military. It’s against this backdrop that Reuters reported: The Air Force is denying early retirement to all transgender service members with between 15 and 18 years of military service, opting instead to force them out with no retirement benefits, according to a memo seen by Reuters. These longer-serving transgender service members will have the same choice as more junior ones: quit or be forced out, with corresponding lump-sum payments as they walk out the door, the August 4 memo says. In other words, there might very well be transgender service members who are thinking to themselves, “I'd prefer to keep serving, but if the Air Force no longer wants me because of my gender identity, I’ll just retire.” The Air Force is effectively responding, “If you retire, you’ll be eligible for retirement benefits, and we don’t want you to have them.” What’s more, according to Reuters’ report, many service members had already been approved for early retirement, but those approvals were rescinded. An Air Force spokesperson said that a subset of retirement applications were “prematurely approved.” Shannon Minter of the National Center for LGBTQ Rights told Reuters the developments are “devastating,” adding, “This is just betrayal of a direct commitment made to these service members.”

Article: However, Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has now scrapped that rule, announcing on Fox News that the agency has removed age barriers and will “no longer have a cap on how old you can be” to join. The agency is reportedly looking for a digital advertising company to “dominate” digital media channels, targeting Gen Z via ads on social media and streaming services like Hulu and HBO Max. (The phrase “your culture” is doing a lot of offensive work there.) The agency has even sent targeted emails to hundreds of local police officers and sheriff’s deputies across the country trying to poach them, a move that’s angering local law enforcement leaders in the process. Thanks to the more than $29 billion in funding for hiring and training from Trump’s spending bill, ICE is now offering up to $50,000 in a signing bonus for new recruits and up to $60,000 in student debt repayment. That means that while the Trump administration is trying to arrest, imprison and deport an unprecedented number of immigrants, there will be fewer and fewer immigration judges to hear their cases and decide whether their arrests were lawful.

Article: In one email from the Trump-Republican joint fundraising committee, Trump said, falsely, that he signed into law a measure for "no taxes on Social Security." Now, they're promising yet another imaginary benefit: tariff rebate checks. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that would give Americans a one-time $600 refundable credit on their income taxes next year — the same amount as the second round of stimulus checks during the coronavirus pandemic. (The checks would phase out for married couples making more than $150,000 a year.) Trump, who always knows a popular idea when he hears it — even if he has no intention of following through — quickly endorsed it, saying, "We're thinking about a little rebate." To be clear: This is not going to happen. First, if the tariff rebates were similar to the coronavirus stimulus, they'd cost the federal government about $164 billion, which is most of the money generated by the tariffs in the first six months of the year. There's little interest in even more new spending among Republicans in Congress, who passed a megabill earlier in July that is now estimated to cost $4.1 trillion over the next decade. Roger Marshall of Kansas said the money should be used to pay down the debt, instead, since Americans "don't feel like they're being hurt by tariffs." And while Trump said he liked the idea, he also called Hawley a "second-tier senator" around the same time, so it's doubtful that the two are going to work together anytime soon. But these ideas have a way of living on in the twilight areas of the internet, promoted by campaign emails that generate Google searches and lead to stories on local news sites thirsty for clicks, in a vicious cycle of misinformation. "Would you accept a tariff rebate check from President Trump?" Clicking either "yes" or "no" took me to the same website, where I could say whether I would like to receive anywhere from $600 (not happening) to $5,000 (definitely not happening) and whether I would invest it, save it, pay off debt, book a vacation or donate it to charity, before asking if I would like to donate to a Republican Senate candidate. The emails are an implicit admission that tariffs are raising prices for Americans, which is why Hawley had to go out of his way to claim that they are actually supposed to help people hurt by former President Joe Biden's policies, instead. For years, Republicans have attacked them for promising "goodies" to voters, which has led the party's establishment to avoid criticism by creating ever more elaborate programs, tax credits and subsidies when it wants to achieve some goal, like getting more people health insurance or fighting climate change.

Article: In his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” written in the midst of the Great Depression, the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that in times of economic crisis, the government could “fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again.” Such a plan might not be the most efficient way to create jobs and keep the economy afloat, Keynes conceded, but it “would be better than nothing.” While the American economy is certainly not in the throes of anything like the Great Depression, we do seem to have arrived at a banknote-burial scheme for the 21st century. The July jobs report showed an average of just 35,000 jobs created per month over the last three months, leading Trump to fire the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for reporting the bad news. It seems to be the thing that a lot of smart people are looking at very strongly, and our country will be prospering like never before.” While Silicon Valley is drowning in AI startups of all sizes, when it comes to capital investment most of the spending comes from the small number of giant companies known as “hyperscalers.” Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and a few others are investing spectacular amounts of money to build vast windowless boxes holding thousands of processing units. But massive corporations aren’t pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI as a public service — they think it will bring them even more fantastical riches in the future. This is the problem communities that have welcomed data centers have confronted: While billions are spent initially, which does provide work for construction workers, electricians and plumbers, those benefits are temporary. Every tech CEO may dream of the day their superintelligent AI product (likely making them the world’s first trillionaire), but the benefits to the rest of us are hazy at best. Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote, “It seems clear that in the coming years, AI will improve all our existing systems and enable the creation and discovery of new things that aren’t imaginable today.” But in truth, it’s not so clear.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to open a grand jury investigation into Obama administration officials in connection with their investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is the latest brazen political stunt by a Justice Department that has completely lost its moral compass. (Disclosure: My organization, Democracy Defenders Fund, has represented numerous former Justice Department lawyers and staff members targeted by the Trump administration over the past six months in other egregious circumstances.) Bondi’s decision stems from National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard’s absurd claim last month that Obama officials engaged in an attempted “coup” by manipulating intelligence assessments of Russian interference. Unsurprisingly in an administration in which the Justice Department and intelligence agencies subserviently do the president’s bidding, Gabbard’s claim predictably parrots an accusation Trump has raised since 2017: that Barack Obama colluded with the Russians. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation concluded Russian interference in the 2016 election was “sweeping and systematic,” leading to criminal charges against 34 people, including seven Americans and 26 Russians, and three Russian organizations. In 2020, a comprehensive investigation by a Republican-led Senate special committee found that the intelligence community investigation “presents a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference.” And during his first term, Trump’s Justice Department appointed a special counsel to investigate the investigators, who found nothing to discredit Mueller’s work and spectacularly failed to validate Trump’s dismissal of the Russia investigation as a hoax. Like the Mueller report, which lacked “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” America should have no confidence that these undeniable facts will be presented to the grand jury. Gabbard described her criminal referral to Justice Department as a “treasonous conspiracy.” In common usage, “treason” is often invoked to describe any devious act of betrayal against the democratic and constitutional values of our nation. More likely, Bondi will focus on crimes such as obstruction of justice or misuse of classified information, scrutinizing any of the countless, subjective decisions made by intelligence officials about how they gathered and evaluated evidence. Clement Stone famously said, “truth will always be truth, regardless of lack of understanding, disbelief, or ignorance.” Here, the obvious truth is that there was no “treasonous conspiracy” — just public servants doing their patriotic duty to decipher the extent of Russian interference in our democracy. That prompted the president to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after he called the economic data “rigged,” a move that drew opposition even from Republican senators.

Article: After Trump signed a bill clawing back $1 billion in funding, the nonprofit that supports PBS, NPR and more than 1,500 local public TV and radio stations around the country announced it will shut down by the start of next year. They can read The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post — plus the upcoming California Post — or The Daily Wire, The Federalist, the Daily Caller and Breitbart News. The conservative complaints about the news media date back decades to the days of three TV networks, when the evening news and daily newspapers set the nation’s agenda and anchors such as Walter Cronkite had tremendous sway. For example, long before Watergate dominated the headlines, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and affirmative action in government contracting, but never got his due from a skeptical press. He built a direct emotional connection not just with Republicans, but with millions of Democrats — the original “Reagan Democrats.” And in doing so, he exposed the limits of traditional media. One of the main selling points of radio commentators such as Rush Limbaugh was that he was a lonely voice in the liberal wilderness, helping connect everyone from truckers to commuters to families out for a drive in this new conservative community. It certainly explains the self-defeating decision by so many Republican members of Congress to shut down the CPB, which helps fund local radio and TV stations in rural areas they represent.

Article: “The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” Boasberg wrote in April, finding probable cause that government defendants had violated his order. That sentiment was echoed by the dissent on Friday, with Judge Cornelia Pillard backing her fellow Obama appointee in writing that the panel majority “does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.” Yet it was Boasberg who overstepped, according to the Trump-appointed judges in the majority, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao. While noting that the trial judge “was placed in an enormously difficult position” in dealing with fast-paced litigation, Katsas wrote that the government’s conduct “clearly and indisputably was not criminal.” Rao wrote that Boasberg “used the threat of criminal contempt to coerce the Executive Branch to comply with an order it had no authority to enforce.” Pillard closed her dissent by citing legal principles regarding obeying court orders and the fair administration of justice.

Article: August is the time of the summer when people start stocking away all those American flags put out for the Fourth of July celebrations and putting away the star-spangled outfits they carefully assembled this summer for Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour. Because the flag should be embraced and displayed more proudly than ever by liberal-leaning Americans who have generally conceded this core American symbol as something central to the right-wing conservative brand. Long before the Trump administration began its campaign of deportations, DEI attacks and direct assaults on women’s rights, LGBTQ progress and anything that smacked of pluralism, well-funded conservative groups, through signaling and symbolism, established an exclusionary notion of who constituted a “real” American. Well, that is unacceptable, and acknowledging that conservatives have, indeed, co-opted America’s most patriotic symbol is the first step in combating this exclusionary notion of who a so-called real American is. A CBS News poll conducted just ahead of the Fourth of July found that 91% of respondents who identified as Republicans say they “sometimes” or “often” fly the flag as a symbol of patriotism, compared with 64% of independents and 51% of Democrats. I wrote about this in a book I published last year called “Our Hidden Conversations, What American’s Really Think About Race & Identity,” based on my work at The Race Card Project, where I have collected hundreds of thousands of candid stories about race, identity, culture, privilege and belonging from hundreds of thousands of people from all corners of America. Many of those people talk about their place in America and whether they or their children will be “American enough,” not just based on paperwork or legal status, but based on the social norms that took root at this country’s founding and created a hierarchy based on skin color, lineage, immigration status and money. In her seminal book, ‘The White Album,’ Joan Didion said, ‘A place belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image.’” These words should speak loudly to us right now. That is one reason I so love the short documentary released last month called “Reclaim the Flag” from Alex Bittar and Bruce Cohen, who conduct bracing interviews with several leaders in the LGBTQ community about what the flag means to them in this moment. “When you walk past a house that has an American flag stoked up in the yard, your immediate thought about that person is — I’m not welcome here — that it’s a sign of bigotry and a sign of fear, and how sad is that?” said musician and actress, King Princess. Comedian Chris Klemens said, “I see someone hanging a flag and I’m like — you would hit with me with a car if you had the opportunity.” He was laughing when he said it. George Takei, the actor and activist who portrayed the helmsman Sulu on the USS Enterprise in the “Star Trek” TV series, describes learning about the flag as a young child in a forced incarceration camp/war relocation authority concentration camp where his Japanese American family was sent to live during World War II. The reason I advocate for this film and hope many will watch it on YouTube is that it culminates in the very hopeful message captured in its title: Reclaim the flag. You don’t have to reclaim what’s yours, darling.” When people start to let go of their rightful claim to the core symbol that should unite and encompass everyone, it makes it easier to snatch away a person’s stakeholder status. There is no reason that we can’t say that this symbol of America is our symbol too instead of feeling like this is a thing that we have run away from. It has to be a reclaiming by the whole population of those of us who believe in an open and liberal world.” That to me sounds like a good idea. I was raised by two postal workers who were oddly patriotic during my childhood when flying big flags and wearing flag emblazoned clothing were out of step with the “Say it Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)” culture of the ’60s and the ’70s. They were proud Black Americans who decided to love a country that didn’t love them back, and their point of view has come in handy as I tell my own adult children that you sometimes have to fight for a country that will most certainly break your heart.

Warren rightly called him out for failing to live up to his economic promises and raised concerns that he would install “some sycophant who’s going to give data that makes the president happy” as BLS commissioner. A multipost rant in which he called Warren a “LOSER!” and demanded CNBC “Call her out!!!” When the economy did not immediately collapse, Trump quickly declared victory — but it was short-lived. And the president faces another, more immediate problem: If he is planning to fire anyone who brings him bad economic news, he may soon run out of messengers to shoot. The stock market tanked and bond yields surged, prompting Trump to quickly walk back his most draconian measures, while still leaving overall tariffs at their highest level since the Great Depression. Last week’s personal consumption expenditures price index for June, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, increased by 2.6% compared to a year ago, with the “core” measure rising by even more.

Article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s recruitment push appears to have brought in at least one new high-profile agent: actor Dean Cain, best known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.” Cain, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, made the announcement Wednesday in a video posted to Instagram. In the Instagram video, the actor encouraged his followers to follow his lead and join the agency: “If you want to help save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America’s streets. I voted for that.” (CBS News reported at the end of June that, according to government figures, only 8% of those detained since Trump took office have a conviction for a violent crime.) “You can defend your homeland and get great benefits,” Cain said, listing new incentives rolled out by the administration as part of its push to recruit ICE officers, such as signing bonuses and what he referred to as “legal” student loan repayment. The agency has been desperately trying to boost recruitment to keep up with the administration's deportation goals, after Congress passed Trump’s spending bill, which allocated billions in funding for the hiring of 10,000 additional agents.

Cape buffalo are considered one of the "most 'wanted' dangerous game animal by trophy hunters across the globe," according to the safari company.

Gaza reached that point after Israel escalated its prior siege of the territory to block virtually all aid from March to May, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages still in Gaza. When Israel allowed aid back in, it did so mostly under a contentious new aid delivery system that resulted in the killings of hundreds of Palestinians and kept all but the strongest and luckiest from getting food. Now Israel is pausing the fighting in some parts of Gaza each day to help aid convoys move, approving some imported food for sale in Gaza and allowing aid to be airdropped.

That followed his announcement on Thursday that Israel would finally defeat Hamas by occupying all of Gaza and then handing it to “Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us.” This latest endeavor, which may take weeks to begin, risks ending the same way as all his previous efforts: in a strategic dead-end, with Hamas still holding on by its fingertips, Israeli hostages still in Hamas’s grip, and Palestinian civilians trapped in a dystopian nightmare. Israel captured much of Gaza City in the first months of war, seizing some areas more than once, before relinquishing it all on the false assumption that Hamas had been defeated.

The victim, Asher Watkins, 52, a Dallas real estate executive who sold ranches, was pursuing one of the horned buffaloes in Limpopo Province, the northernmost province in South Africa, when the attack happened, Coenraad Vermaak Safaris said in an email on Thursday. A mature Cape buffalo bull can weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, the company’s website says, cautioning that it is not unusual for buffaloes to charge hunters without provocation and that “no species on the planet has a more fearsome reputation.” The aggressive temperament of the Cape buffalo has earned it a nickname: black death. “Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers,” Hans Vermaak, whose family runs the safari company, said in a statement.

He doubled already hefty tariffs on Indian exports to the United States for its steadfast refusal to stop buying oil from Russia, in an effort to pressure Russia to end the war. Trump has accused India of helping Russia finance its war on Ukraine through oil purchases; India has said it needs cheap oil to meet the energy needs of its fast-growing economy. India called the additional tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,” pointing out that it was being punished for doing something — buying Russian oil at a discounted price — that other nations have done, although it didn’t mention names. China is the largest buyer of Russian oil, and Turkey has also deepened its energy links with Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, without incurring similar penalties.

Article: When Britain’s foreign secretary declared last week that his government would recognize the state of Palestine if Israel did not agree to a cease-fire with Hamas, he said the British were doing so with the “hand of history on our shoulders.” His French counterpart also invoked history in explaining why France had taken the same step a week earlier. French leaders going back to Charles de Gaulle, he said, had called for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on “the recognition by each of the states involved of all the others.” Neither man mentioned the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the secret treaty between Britain and France in 1916, under which the European colonial powers carved up the Levantine territories of the crumbling Ottoman Empire into spheres of British and French control. Sykes-Picot is cited by historians as an enduring example of Western imperial arrogance — a cynical exercise in drawing borders that cut across religious, ethnic and tribal communities in what are today Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories.

That aspect of the agreements with Columbia and Brown, which goes well beyond the information typically provided to the government, was largely overlooked amid splashier news that the universities had promised to pay tens of millions of dollars to settle claims of violations of federal anti-discrimination laws, including accusations that they had tolerated antisemitism.

Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled against the administration in a case brought by the Authors Guild, saying that the cancellation of already approved funding for 1,400 research projects violated the First Amendment. In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked.

A Swiss maker of precision cutting tools said his company would start layoffs almost immediately for its small American work force of 10 people because it could not afford to absorb the 39 percent tariff, nor pass the whole price increase onto its American manufacturing customers. The dimming prospects for business in the United States also drove the decision, according to the company’s chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation by Mr. Officials thought they had made a convincing case to their American counterparts to reduce an initial 31 percent tariff threat by highlighting the major investments that Swiss companies have made in the United States, including by the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis.

Image President Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced an agreement last month to lower tariffs on goods from the European Union, to 15 percent. They tried to explain that three-quarters of the trade deficit with the United States was due to gold bullion and bars refined in Swiss foundries, which do not face tariffs.

Article: The California Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a lower court to reconsider a state policy that reduced how much utilities have to pay homeowners with rooftop solar panels for the energy that they send to the electric grid. The court did not deem California’s policy illegal but said a State Court of Appeal had erred in affirming the policy without fully reviewing it and by being too deferential to state regulators. The rooftop solar industry and its allies hailed the decision as a big win and said it could open the door to reversing a policy that has sharply reduced the installation of solar panels on California homes over the last two years. “Justice is served, and the sun shines a little brighter on California today,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group, one of the parties that challenged the state policy.

Now, the Trump administration appears to be floating numbers to see what governments would accept on the “rules of origin.” One such proposal to Thailand recently was whether 70 percent locally made was attainable, according to a senior Thai official involved in trade talks with the United States.

It’s more difficult to understand why the trilogy’s most prominent fans today are Silicon Valley tech lords like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and a rising group of far-right politicians in both Europe and the United States. Why do so many of today’s high-profile fans of “The Lord of the Rings” and other fantasy and sci-fi classics insist on turning these cautionary tales into aspirational road maps for mastering the universe? Some of the answers lie in the sheer popularity of the trilogy, which has sold more than 150 million copies across the world and permeated the public imagination, as genre fiction has moved from the margins to the mainstream.

Guy Parmelin, the Swiss economy minister, said at the conference that the country’s industries would be hit hard by the high tariff rate as well as the uncertainty over when and whether it might be reduced. will be effectively annihilated.” The crisis has reignited a longstanding debate in Switzerland over whether to remain independent from the European Union, which faces a 15 percent tariff as part of a deal with Mr. Switzerland already took a step in that direction in June, when the government approved a package agreed upon with the European Union to streamline their trade ties after a decade of thorny negotiations. Georges Kern, the chief executive of the luxury Swiss watch brand Breitling, said in an interview that the company had enough inventory in the United States to last roughly three months. Kern hoped for a trade agreement in the coming weeks, and said Swiss companies “can and will contribute to find a solution with President Trump to address his concerns.” Image During talks with American officials, the Swiss highlighted the major investments that their companies had made in the United States, including the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis. Sedat Suna/Getty Images Pierre-Yves Bonvin, the chief executive Steiger Textil, a Swiss company that makes industrial knitting machines, described the tariffs as a “tsunami.” Swiss businesses had been led by the government to believe that they would face a top tariff of 15 percent, he said, which they could have managed. A Swiss maker of precision cutting tools said his company would start layoffs almost immediately for its small American work force of 10 people because it could not afford to absorb the 39 percent tariff, nor pass the whole price increase onto its American manufacturing customers. The dimming prospects for business in the United States also drove the decision, according to the company’s chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation by Mr. Officials thought they had made a convincing case to their American counterparts to reduce an initial 31 percent tariff threat by highlighting the major investments that Swiss companies have made in the United States, including by the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis. Trump’s recent focus has been on wrangling big deals with big economies, announcing agreements with the European Union and Japan that reduced tariffs in exchange for huge investments in the United States and energy purchases from American producers. Image President Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced an agreement last month to lower tariffs on goods from the European Union, to 15 percent. They tried to explain that three-quarters of the trade deficit with the United States was due to gold bullion and bars refined in Swiss foundries, which do not face tariffs.

Many forecasters expect a deterioration in the months ahead, as tariffs disrupt supply chains and the Trump administration’s policies on immigration and government job cuts start to take a toll on the economy. Oxford Economics, a research firm that provides economic forecasts, said on Tuesday that it expected trade volumes to decline throughout the year as high inventory levels, weaker business and consumer spending, and elevated prices all weighed on demand for goods.

Article: And this time, I not only passed out, but I vomited and had to be brought back with smelling salts, which — Casey, if you have never experienced smelling salts, they’re not messing around. But it is one of the most amazing, crazy experiences you can have in the human — do you know what I mean, the moment when your consciousness just leaves you? kevin roose And because we are going to talk about OpenAI, I should add my disclosure that The New York Times Company is suing them and Microsoft for copyright violations. So I actually thought it was cool that he said that because now we have one thing to hang on to where well, maybe when a model can do that, we’ll feel like we really are getting close to AGI. But the one other thing that he said that struck me that I thought was kind of funny was that he said that after they had put GPT-5 together, he went back to using GPT-4. So I do think it’s really notable now that even free users, which I think is going to include a lot of high school and college students out there, are now going to have access to what, at least they are saying, is PhD level intelligence and reasoning. But for GPT-5, OpenAI is doing away with the model picker, or at least making it less necessary because they have built this, what they called a router that will essentially analyze your request, and how much computation it needs to be able to answer that request, and whether it’s a simple query or something more involved. And I think for a lot of people, this is going to be their first experience with a reasoning model because OpenAI does not make that the default right now in ChatGPT. On the other hand, I do feel like it sets up an incentive for OpenAI, which wants to save as much money as it can to just always try to route you to the absolute least compute that you need. And so I will just be curious to see if I feel like that is affecting the quality of my experience now that maybe can’t go in and actually say, hey, let me use the good stuff. And that might be a good point to bring up two of the questions that got asked of the GPT-5 team during the briefing that were on the — that I think would be of interest to our listeners. I mean, I wonder if they are starting to finesse their definitions of the scaling laws to account for the new reasoning models because people, for months now, have been saying, well, the models in the pre-training phase may have gotten as good as they’re going to get or about as good as they’re going to get. And all of the labs have had experiences where they thought they were training a new model and then it didn’t quite work out as well as they wanted it to and so they assign it some lower number, that’s happened at least a number of big labs that I know about. To me, that is one of the most interesting things about this release is whatever GPT-5 turns out to be, this is the thing that they thought was the next big step forward. And I think it was reasonable to expect, and I certainly expected that in the wake of all that, they would slow down and maybe allow some competitors to catch up. And I think one thing I’ll have my eye on over the next several months is, are they able to continue iterating very quickly or have some of the losses that they’ve experienced over the past few weeks really hurt them? And I think in particular, if you are a free user of ChatGPT, you’re going to have a great day because for the first time now, in addition to standard ChatGPT model, you’re going to have some reasoning capability. I mean, the way I saw people talking about it online was that they thought that OpenAI had not raised the ceiling of the AI frontier by a lot with GPT-5, but they had raised the floor, essentially. What makes that figure interesting, I think, Kevin, is that that number is a lot smaller than Anthropic’s Claude for Opus API, which comes in at $15 per million input tokens. So I think some of these really well capitalized AI labs are taking this moment to say, hey, we’re going to put a lot of pricing pressure on some of our competitors. In fact, some people are posting online screenshots of some prediction markets that until today, when asked, who do you think will have the most powerful AI model at the end of August, were showing OpenAI in the lead. So I don’t want to overstate what that means necessarily, but it does seem like there was a huge contingent of people who thought that GPT-5 was going to be this revolutionary new model. One of them is that The New York Times Company has recently agreed to a licensing deal with Amazon that will allow Amazon access to “Times” content for its AI platforms, including Alexa. The second thing we should say is that if you have an Alexa device, it is going to be going off constantly during this segment, unless you go over right now and hit the little button that mutes it. And I use zero of them because the three things that I use Alexa for are setting timers, choosing music to play in my house, and telling me the weather before I leave for the day. But when generative AI started to get good a couple years ago, I think people naturally started to ask, well, when is Alexa going to start using this new generative AI technology? But it seemed like a natural thing to expect that Alexa would start to incorporate some of this technology to be able to answer maybe more open-ended questions, to give longer, more detailed responses, to do more than just set timers and tell you the weather. I mean, once OpenAI released voice mode for ChatGPT, it just immediately seemed so much more interesting and powerful than Alexa and Siri, which is Apple’s very similar system that it makes for its devices. And so yeah, I think both of us were like, OK, well, when are we going to get that OpenAI style voice mode in these smart devices that we have in our homes? And part of what I’m so excited to talk with Daniel Rausch, the VP of Alexa, about later in this show, is just why it’s been so hard to shove an LLM-based generative AI technology into this pre-existing assistant product. But we should just talk briefly about what Alexa+ is and then our experiences with it because both you and I have gotten to try this over the past few days. We don’t know exactly which model or models, but it seems to be a mix of Amazon’s proprietary AI models and then maybe some of Claude, which it has a deal with Anthropic. The other big difference I noticed right away is that the new Alexa+ does not require you to say the wake word, like Alexa, between every question and answer pair. And then you can just say, order me an Uber from this place to this place, or I want a table at a restaurant in downtown San Francisco near the Ferry Building for two people at 6:30 tomorrow. And it was just this forever — and so I eventually just unplugged the thing because I was like, why did I just spend $90 to have a permanent rotating advertisement for household products on my desk? Now, there are a lot of things I’m willing to do for a podcast, but mount an Echo Show on my wall — kevin roose You’re not willing to do a construction project. And it’s like, this — and right here, we have just landed in the exact spot that has been bedeviling Apple for the last year, that is bedeviling Alexa right now. And after two days of ads for paper towels and one day of I’m not going to show you the lemon pasta, I thought, what am I doing with my life? kevin roose So the new Alexa+ update seems to have broken Alexa’s ability to reliably set and cancel alarms, which is a core thing that I use this product for. And so for example, this morning, I woke up on my own a little bit earlier than my alarm, like, 10 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off. And one of the things it said was, I can help you explore Gen Z music trends, which there was just something funny about the way it said it to me. But now you’re trying to sell me Amazon Music, which I feel like is very consistent with how Alexa+ handles everything, which is, could we sell you a service right now? Two, I’m very confident that lots of other people are probably having much better experiences with this thing because I think if most people were having experiences as bad as me, I just would have heard about this before now. But I think my overall impression is that the Alexa+ that you have now in this early access program, it is a little like having a kind of GPT-3.5 class model inside of a smart speaker, which I think is a valuable thing and one that I would like them to continue to build on. casey newton I think the most powerful thing that the Alexa+ has done for me is it has made me forgive Apple for not shipping anything with the new Siri. I think what’s happening with Alexa and Siri right now is sort of a — it’s like a symbol of what’s happening in the American economy writ large, which is we are trying to jam these new AI technologies into these legacy systems and processes. I also just think that when I’m using a chatbot on my laptop and it gives me something that’s 80 percent or 85 percent right, that’s much more useful to me than an Alexa response that’s 85 percent right because a chatbot setting, I can just take what I need. But really, it’s a complete re-architecture of everything that you would say Alexa is from the way you have a conversation and engage with the experience at a very basic level all the way through Alexa acknowledging you or just maintaining a chat. I think it’s fair to say we both had some things that impressed us about the new Alexa+ and some things that were challenging, including some of the basic stuff that Alexa seemed to be very good at before, or at least that I know how to get reliable performance out of Alexa for that no longer seem to work as well. Because back in 2023, when Amazon announced that it was going to revamp Alexa, give it this brain upgrade with these new AI capabilities, they said this was going to be ready in 2024. If you go back to 2023 and the models that were available then, the state of the art, very little instruction following reasoning, low ability to execute on these interfaces with other systems, we announced something called Let’s Chat, which was a mode of Alexa. So think about flipping a switch on Alexa and turning on a chat interface so that you can do some basic question and answer and have a discussion about a topic, mostly about knowledge native to the model’s training data versus bringing something in at runtime the way that modern chatbots answer questions by going out on the internet. I think as all of us know, you sit there and fiddle with a chatbot long enough to press it into being smarmy or responding in ways that we don’t believe are the way Alexa might act, for example, or press it to give you wrong information that’s from some unauthoritative source or a mistake in its training data online, shifts back to its native training. Personalizing an experience of this depth so that Alexa is always learning from her interactions with you and extending your interactions so they get more delightful over time, I think this is something you probably wouldn’t have seen in a weekend’s worth of fiddling with the experience. And I think if you rewind the tape to 2023, it’s really about learning how big a project Alexa+ would be and then starting to put one foot in front of the other, really inventing the space of creating those integrations because it just hasn’t been done. But the amount of work that went into just the interface between a large language model and the downstream systems that complete tasks is — I mean, it’s the biggest body of work that we’ve put in. And it would be too much to even try — without a whiteboard here, it would be too much to even try to explain to you and your listeners, I think, the technical depth that went into it. There was a former machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, Mihail Eric, who did a long post on X last year, sort of his version of a postmortem or retrospective on what was happening with Alexa. And he wrote that Amazon had, quote, “all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.” But then he said that Amazon and Alexa had fumbled the ball because Alexa was, quote, “riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.” He made it seem like the problem was not just that the technology was an uneasy fit, but that there were also some organizational and bureaucracy problems that had to be solved. But I do think the team is inspired by the vision, executing at an unbelievable pace and really creating a lot of invention because there are a lot of really hard problems. This is a company that has offered a lot of AI models through AWS, big market share in cloud-based AI, also recently started an AGI lab at Amazon that is going to be pushing towards something like an artificial general intelligence. daniel rausch I would say we do believe — and I share this belief, the leadership team at Amazon has, that this generation of generative AI is going to transform every customer experience we have. So if you look at the scale and scope of what Amazon does and assume our belief that every experience will be transformed with generative AI, it’s as big as Amazon is at that point. To be as productive as you can be in this day and age and get as much done for customers as we aspire to, you have to build AI into how you’re working. On the 5, my first observation was that after I told it I would like to see art, I feel like every time I looked over at it, it was asking me if I wanted to buy paper towels or Advil something. But I felt like the Alexa+ AI thinks of me primarily as a person who might send more money to Amazon if you just gave me a few more ideas for how I might do that. But I do think it comes across as a kind of insecurity in the device like, if we’re not constantly showing you everything that we’ve built into this thing, you’ll never discover it. One of my most delightful — we have a new LLM called For You, which is a place where we post little notifications about things we think you might be interested in. And I had been helping my daughter study the periodic table for part of her chemistry final, and I was never great at remembering, in particular, the elements that you need a mnemonic for, like lead. kevin roose To piggyback on Casey’s question, I think this is one of the big questions about the Alexa business model is whether you see this as something that is going to make money on its own or whether this is primarily a way of increasing the amount of money that people spend on Amazon. And putting it into Prime brings together both all of a customers’ Prime benefits because you might watch a video, or listen to a song from Amazon Music, or use your Amazon Photos benefit, which is awesome with an Echo Show and review your family photos. So some of the more complicated stuff that I tried with Alexa+, such as setting up routines that involve multiple steps such as emailing documents or research papers to the Alexa email address and trying to have it summarize these things, these things just didn’t work for me. What I found more frustrating that I wanted to ask you about, because I’m actually not sure why this happens, was that some of the basic features that Alexa had previously been good at and reliable at for me were less reliable with Alexa+.

Article: This is “The Daily.” After rolling back a slew of regulations aimed at reversing climate change and pulling funding for the scientists who monitor it, the Trump administration is now taking its boldest action yet. On Tuesday, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, traveled to Indianapolis to a truck dealership to make what he called one of the most significant acts of deregulation in American history. But the endangerment finding is the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases in the United States, from automobiles, from power plants, from oil and gas wells, and more. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Massachusetts versus EPA that greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, others are pollutants and that the EPA can regulate them if they pose a danger to human health and welfare. And taking you back to that time, 2008, the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top scientific body, had just recently established the most comprehensive set of information to that date on establishing that climate change is caused by human activities and the dangers that it poses. It went through findings that US scientists under the Bush administration had compiled about the threats of climate change, everything from the way that increased and more intense wildfires and the smoke from wildfires affects human health to the increases in regional ozone pollution that are exacerbated by climate change. And based on this evidence, the Obama administration determined pretty conclusively see that climate change and the emissions that are furthering climate change cause a danger to human health and welfare. [APPLAUSE] lisa friedman That was an effort to reduce emissions from the utility sector, from power plants in the United States, reducing methane from leaks from oil and gas wells, restrictions on automobile tailpipe emissions. And we and others reported that the EPA at that time made the decision that it was not a legal fight that it could win, and it wasn’t a science fight that they felt they could win. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Interestingly, and I think this dynamic still holds, the business community that back in 2009 had been so worried about the endangerment finding by 2016 had really lost an appetite for fighting it. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Lisa, before President Trump returns to office this year and targets this endangerment finding, in the middle of his two terms, of course, we have President Biden, who, it seems worth briefly mentioning, makes regulating climate change a very big priority and gets a lot done on that front. And so the Biden presidency feels like a reinforcement of this idea that the overall arc of where the United States is going is this journey toward regulating emissions and trying to use the government to reduce them. Because through the course of Obama, Trump, and Biden, as much as the first Trump administration promoted fossil fuels, weakened regulations, they never attacked this fundamental understanding, which, like you said, has really become, by this stage, kind of embedded — that climate change is real. But the EPA is making a series of arguments and alternative arguments, what one legal scholar described to me as throwing a bunch of spaghetti to see what sticks with a court. One other thing they argue is that even if the endangerment finding stayed in place, they’re saying that the EPA shouldn’t set standards on greenhouse gas emissions because no matter what technology we apply, we can’t make a dent in the problem of global climate change. michael barbaro Putting aside those legal arguments, I’m curious why, in your reporting, you have found that the White House has decided to go after a finding that, as you have explained very clearly in this conversation, the industry doesn’t really want anymore. And so what Trump is doing in moving to repeal this is really satisfying a request to pull, root and stem, the ability to regulate climate change from the government. michael barbaro It feels, upon reflection, like getting rid of the endangerment finding bookends two very different moments in the climate change conversation in the United States — when it was created back in the Obama presidency and now that it’s coming down. But I think you still see that the majority of Americans — and the Pew polls and others show this — acknowledge climate change, are concerned about climate change, and want the government to take some kind of action — that there is a lot of dispute about. lisa friedman I think when the dust clears on this legal fight — and there will be a big legal fight after the repeal of the endangerment is finalized — I think the question is going to come back to Congress. michael barbaro Not which executive actions stay or get removed and toggle back and forth, but whether the legislative branch ever decides that this is something that it wants to tackle. When Congress failed to pass a big climate law — at the time, it was called cap and trade — he gave a speech where he said, if Congress doesn’t act, I will.

The bill also delays penalties for oil companies that fail to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that leaks from wells, representing about $1.5 billion in benefits for the industry, the Congressional Budget Office found.

Article: michael barbaro I think we’re going to call — yeah, I think we’re going to call you back on a — for the first time in a really long time — a landline. This is “The Daily.” Today’s total solar eclipse will be watched by millions of people across North America, none of them as closely as Fred Espenak, a longtime NASA scientist who’s devoted his entire life to studying, chasing, and popularizing the wonder that is an eclipse. And I made a promise to myself that I was going to get to that eclipse in 1970 to see it because I thought it was a one chance in a lifetime to see a total eclipse of the sun. And I was amazed that outside the back of the motel, in this grassy field, there were dozens and dozens of people with telescopes out there, specifically there for the eclipse that morning. It’s really only in the last 10 minutes or so that you start to notice changes in the environment because now enough of the sun has been covered, upwards of maybe 90 percent of the sun. fred espenak Well, I think, when you see this all transpire, you can easily understand how people thought this was the end of the world because it seems far outside of the realms of nature. You almost get a three-dimensional sense of the motions of the Earth and the moon around the sun when you see this clockwork displayed right in front of you, this mechanics of the eclipse taking place. And I realized, well, I’ve got to expand my outlook on what’s an acceptable distance to travel to see a total eclipse because the next total eclipse then, in 1973, was through the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. michael barbaro And if you’ll permit me a question that might seem maybe dopey to someone in your field, after you’ve seen one or two or three of these, do they start to blend in together and become a little bit the same? fred espenak So I went to grad school at University of Toledo and did some work at Kitt Peak National Observatory, learning the ins and outs of photometric photometry — that is, measuring the brightness of stars. fred espenak Well, I’ve seen total eclipses from Australia, from Africa, from the Altiplanos in Bolivia, from the ice sheet on the coast of Antarctica, and even from Northern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. [bonnie tyler, "total eclipse of the heart"] Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart fred espenak Of course, we had “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” It was a must-have. fred espenak Well, the eclipses are like benchmarks that I can use to figure out what else was going on in my life during these times, because I remember the dates of every single eclipse I’ve been to. It reminds me of when Pat and I got married and between which eclipse we were getting married and had to plan our wedding so it didn’t interfere with any kind of eclipse trips. But I think, for the rest of us — and here, I’m thinking about myself — this is really going to be my first total eclipse, at least that I can remember. And given the hard-earned wisdom that you’ve accumulated in all your decades of chasing eclipses around the world, I wonder if you can give us just a little bit of advice for how to best live inside this very brief window of a total solar eclipse, to make sure, not to be cliche, but that we make it count. fred espenak Well, I think one mistake that people tend to make is getting preoccupied with recording everything in their lives, what they had for lunch, what they had for dinner.

Coming to terms with his loss will be painful in training and in matches, with his absence felt in ways far beyond the gap the Portuguese forward leaves in the starting XI each week. Arsenal Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal have been the form team of the last three seasons in the Premier League, but three second-place finishes in a row are starting to burn deeply in north London. Enzo Maresca’s side stormed to a 3-0 win against the Parisians, who swept through the UEFA Champions League – culminating in their own 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan – to complete the treble. Whether Maresca can continue to tie the team together following the CWC triumph, and whether that tournament will test the legs of the Blues players later in the season, could well be deciding factors in Chelsea’s title challenge. Or will the light blues of Manchester continue to feel the heavy burden of a side that conquered all before them, only to seemingly lose control of their own success last season? The injury to Ballon d’Or holder Rodri undoubtedly hit City hard last term, and the news that he will miss the start of the new campaign will also come as a huge concern to Guardiola. For a team that won an unprecedented five trophies in 2023, and the record-setting Premier League title the following year, to fall so far last season came as a huge shock to all, not least their manager. The Blues also crashed out of the Champions League and League Cup early, and their FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace meant no silverware for the first time in eight years. The summer spree pushed City’s spending for 2025 past the 300-million-pounds ($403.5m) mark, following the arrivals of Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico Gonzalez and Vitor Reis in the January window. We want to try and do better than last season, especially with consistency.” A cloud that continues to hang over the club, however, is that they still face 115 charges of breaking Premier League financial regulations. Manchester United and the rest United have defied their financial woes to reinvent their front three with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo signed earlier in the window, and the big-money move for Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Just like Guardiola, his opposite number across the Manchester divide, how long the reversal in fortunes takes is likely to take will define how much longer Amorim has at the helm. Aston Villa were another side that have threatened to break into the Premier League’s elite, having secured Champions League football two years ago, which resulted in a run to the quarterfinals last year. If the transfer merry-go-round continues, however, then Villa striker Ollie Watkins could be the next on the move, with all of last season’s top four having been linked with a move for the England international at some stage.

Article: Iran has said it will block a corridor planned in the Caucasus under a United States-brokered peace accord between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which has been hailed by other countries in the region as beneficial for achieving lasting peace. Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Saturday that Tehran would block the initiative “with or without Russia”, with which Iran has a strategic alliance alongside Armenia. US President Donald Trump “thinks the Caucasus is a piece of real estate he can lease for 99 years”, Velayati told state-affiliated Tasnim News, referring to the transport corridor included in the peace deal. The terms of the accord, which was unveiled at a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday, include exclusive US development rights to a route through Armenia that would link Azerbaijan to Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave that borders Baku’s ally Turkiye. Advertisement While it welcomed the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ministry said any project near Iran’s borders should be developed “with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and without foreign interference”. For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautiously welcomed the deal, saying on Saturday that Moscow supported efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the region, including the Washington meeting. “The involvement of non-regional players should strengthen the peace agenda, not create new divisions,” the ministry said, adding that it hoped to avoid the “unfortunate experience” of Western-led conflict resolution in the Middle East. A NATO member, Turkiye has strongly backed Azerbaijan in its conflicts with Armenia, but has pledged to restore ties with Yerevan after it signs a final peace deal with Baku. The Turkish presidency said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the peace agreement with Ilham Aliyev, his counterpart from Azerbaijan, and offered Ankara’s support in achieving lasting peace in the region. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also addressed the planned corridor during a visit to Egypt, saying it could “link Europe with the depths of Asia via Turkiye” and would be “a very beneficial development”. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Ahmad Shahidov, of the Azerbaijan Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected a final peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan to be signed in the coming weeks.

Article: The international community must “shoulder its responsibility” and take action against Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the Palestinian foreign affairs minister has told Al Jazeera before an emergency United Nations Security Council session. In an interview on Saturday, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin said the 15-member council must uphold international law when it convenes at UN headquarters in New York on Sunday to discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip. “What has been going in Palestine for the last 22 months is nothing but a genocide, and it’s part and parcel of Israel’s expansionist ideology that wants to take over the entirety of the occupied State of Palestine.” The Israeli security cabinet approved plans this week to seize Gaza City, forcibly displacing nearly one million Palestinians to concentration zones in the south of the bombarded coastal enclave. Palestinians have rejected the Israeli push to force them out of the city while human rights groups and the UN have warned that the plan will worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and lead to further mass casualties. Aghabekian Shahin told Al Jazeera that if Trump – whose administration continues to provide unwavering diplomatic and military support to Israel – wants to reach a solution, Palestinian rights must be taken into account. “There will be no peace in Israel-Palestine, or the region for that matter, or even the world at large, if the rights of the Palestinians are not respected,” she said, noting that this means a Palestinian state must be established. In a social media post on Friday, Netanyahu said he wants “a peaceful civilian administration” to be established in the enclave, “one that is not the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, and not any other terrorist organization”. “If Gaza wants to come back to the core, which is the entirety of the Palestinian land, then it has to become under the control and governance of the Palestinian Authority, the PLO.” Aghabekian Shahin also condemned the international community for failing to act as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a surge in Israeli military and settler attacks in the shadow of the country’s war on Gaza. “It is the inaction that has emboldened the Israelis, including the settlers, to do whatever they are doing for the last six decades, since day one of the 1967 occupation,” she said.

Article: Police in London have arrested hundreds of people at a protest in support of the group Palestine Action, which was classified as a “terror organisation” by the British government last month. I support Palestine Action.” “The people are collectively opposing the genocide in Gaza and the Palestine Action ban,” Defend Our Juries, an advocacy group that organised the protest, wrote on X. The arrests are the latest at a series of protests denouncing the government’s ban on Palestine Action, a move critics say infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest, as well as aims to stifle demonstrations against Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. Reporting from Parliament Square on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego said the threat of arrest or punishment “hasn’t deterred any supporters” of Palestine Action from expressing their backing for the group. “We’re now living in an alternative universe and I’m not going to accept it.” ‘Campaign of defiance’ In advance of Saturday’s protest, more than 200 people had been detained in a wave of demonstrations across the UK denouncing the ban since it came into force in July. More than 350 academics from around the world signed onto an open letter this week applauding a “growing campaign of collective defiance” against the decision by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to proscribe Palestine Action. The signatories “deplore the repressive consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond”, the letter read. Amnesty International UK has condemned the arrest of peaceful protesters solely for holding signs, saying such action constitutes “a violation of the UK’s international obligations to protect the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly”.

The group accuses the UK’s government of complicity in what it says are Israeli war crimes in Gaza, where Israel’s bombardment and blockade have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians since October 2023. According to the group, planes from the Brize Norton base also fly to a British Air Force base in Cyprus to then be dispatched to collect intelligence shared with the Israeli government.

Article: Syria’s new government will not take part in planned meetings with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Paris, Syria’s state news agency has reported, as tensions mount between the two sides. SANA’s report on Saturday cast doubt over an integration deal signed this year by the armed group and Syria’s interim government, which took over after the overthrow of longtime President Bashar al-Assad in December. Quoting an unnamed government source, the news agency said the government wants future negotiations to be held in the Syrian capital, Damascus, “as it is the legitimate and national address for dialogue among Syrians”. The deal aims to stitch back together a country fractured by 14 years of war, paving the way for Kurdish-led forces that hold a quarter of Syria and regional Kurdish governing bodies to integrate with Damascus.

Article: Gaza’s Ministry of Health said on Saturday that the total number of malnutrition deaths has reached 212, including 98 children, since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023. Most of the deaths have occurred in recent weeks as Israel continues to impose severe restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza after partially lifting a total blockade in late May. On Friday, the World Food Programme (WFP) called on Israel to allow the delivery of at least 100 aid trucks per day to Gaza, noting that only 60 of its aid truck drivers have been vetted and approved by the Israeli military to date. The 100 trucks per day the organisation called for is a fraction of the 600 per day other United Nations agencies and Gaza authorities have said are needed to meet the basic needs of Gaza residents. “Convoy movements are frequently hampered by last-minute changes by Israeli authorities, and heavy insecurity due to military activities along convoy routes.” In its latest statement on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, noted that it has not been allowed to bring any humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food and medicine, for more than five months, depriving hungry and ailing Palestinians of what they need to survive. Advertisement UNRWA has been calling on Israel to lift its siege on Gaza, saying the ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid from several countries “are very expensive and ineffective” at reaching those urgently in need. ‘No one and nowhere is safe’ As the death toll continues to soar, international condemnation of Israel’s conduct in the war is growing, with several countries raising alarm over Israel’s plans to seize Gaza City in an operation that could forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to concentration zones in southern Gaza. “People are wondering what’s going to happen to them, what’s going to be left of Gaza if Israel moves on with its approved plan to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, starting with Gaza City,” he said. Speaking at a joint news conference in El Alamein with his Egyptian counterpart after meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Fidan said members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had been called to an emergency meeting to tackle the crisis.

The Lebanese army has been working with the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon (UNIFIL) to dismantle Hezbollah military infrastructure as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel that came into force in November. The deadly explosion comes as the Lebanese government this week approved United States-backed plans to disarm Hezbollah – a move the Lebanese group has rejected, saying such demands serve Israeli interests. UN spokesperson Farhan Haq had told reporters that peacekeepers and Lebanese troops found “three bunkers, artillery, rocket launchers, hundreds of explosive shells and rockets, anti-tank mines and about 250 ready-to-use improvised explosive devices”. pic.twitter.com/8s5EkNAdSh — Diodato Abagnara (@DiodatoAbagnara) August 9, 2025 Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said in a social media post on Saturday that “Lebanon mourns” the soldiers who were killed “while fulfilling their national duty”.

Article: India shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during fighting in May, India’s air force chief says, the first such statement from the country since the deadly conflict with its neighbour. Air Chief Marshal Staff Amar Preet Singh made the announcement on Saturday, weeks after India’s military acknowledged that an unspecified number of its own jets were also shot down by Pakistan during their heaviest fighting in decades. “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed and one large aircraft,” Singh said at a military lecture in the southern city of Bengaluru, adding that the large aircraft, which could have been a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300km (186 miles). “If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification – though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said in a social media post. “Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment.” Singh, the Indian air force chief, did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed but said air strikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F-16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two airbases in southeastern Pakistan.

Article: Three Thai soldiers have been injured by a landmine while patrolling the border with Cambodia, according to the army, days after the two neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire following a violent five-day conflict last month. One soldier lost a foot and two others were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine as they patrolled an area between Thailand’s Sisaket and Cambodia’s Preah Vihear provinces on Saturday morning, the Royal Thai Armed Forces said. Cambodia’s defence ministry said that it “has yet to receive clear confirmation from Cambodian frontline forces concerning the explosion,” adding that its army has been strictly respecting the spirit of the ceasefire. It would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty, the Thai foreign ministry said in a statement. The clashes halted with a ceasefire on July 28 after United States President Donald Trump warned both sides that he would not conclude trade deals with them if fighting continued. A meeting of defence officials in Kuala Lumpur ended on Thursday with a deal to extend the ceasefire, and the two sides also agreed to allow observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.

Article: United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced that the US is to cut funding for mRNA vaccine development – a move that health experts say is “dangerous” and could make the US much more vulnerable to future outbreaks of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. Kennedy is known for his vaccine scepticism and recently ousted all 17 members of a scientific advisory panel on vaccines at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be replaced with his own selections. However, this latest announcement is just part of a series of moves by President Donald Trump himself that appear to target the vaccine industry and give increasing weight to the arguments of vaccine sceptics in the US. “My main concern is that this is part of an increasingly ideological rather than evidence-based approach to healthcare and vaccination in particular that is being adopted in the US,” David Elliman, associate professor at University College London, told Al Jazeera. The main reason, he said, was that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had reviewed mRNA vaccines and found them to be “ineffective” in fighting mutating viruses. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts, … HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” Instead, Kennedy said, the US will shift mRNA funding to other vaccine development technologies that are “safer” and “remain effective”. Some notable institutions and companies that will be affected by the latest decision, as listed on the HHS website, include: Emory University and Tiba Biotech (terminated contracts) Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus (rejected or cancelled proposals) Luminary Labs, ModeX (“descoped” or weakened contracts) AstraZeneca and Moderna (“restructured” contracts) What are mRNA vaccines, and are they really ineffective against virus mutations? “The technology has great promise for vaccines and therapeutics, so ceasing research in the field without good evidence is unjustified.” The move, he added, could discourage investors and scientists, both inside and outside the US, from keeping up research. At the least, there should be notice and an opportunity for hearing and explanation under our administrative law, and there was instead a short and cursory X video with no references, no real data,” she said. In another 2023 podcast, Kennedy said, “No vaccine is safe or effective.” Aside from his vaccine scepticism, Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, has also made several controversial remarks about other health issues, such as COVID-19. We’re giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children.” In subsequent interviews, Trump called childhood vaccines a “monster shot” and in 2015 during a debate among Republican presidential candidates said vaccines were “meant for a horse, not a child”. Advertisement Additionally, in his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration initially downplayed the virus, but it ultimately oversaw the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines in a project it called Operation Warp Speed. In May, Kennedy announced that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women without giving details about the reasons behind the change in policy. In May, the FDA approved Novavax’s non-mRNA, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine although only for older adults and those over the age of 12 who also have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk from the virus. The 2026 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), a public-private entity formed in 2002 to support vaccine distribution to low and middle-income countries. GAVI was instrumental in securing vaccines for several countries in Africa and other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was feared that richer countries could stockpile the available doses. Trump’s health budget proposals in 2018 and subsequently proposed budget cuts to the National Institute of Health and the CDC would have impacted immunisation programmes and a wide range of life-saving research on vaccines.

Article: “I cannot wait to start learning from [manager] Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.” Manchester United, who finished 15th in the Premier League last season, have also signed forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for the new campaign, which starts at home against Arsenal on August 17. Advertisement “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football,” Jason Wilcox, Man United’s director of football, said in the club’s announcement. “The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United, as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.” Current United strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored just 18 goals between them in all competitions last term as United fell to a club-record 18 losses in the Premier League era and its lowest points total of 42. Only four teams scored fewer goals than United in the top flight last term – including the three relegated clubs – as the 20-time English champion recorded its lowest finish in the modern era when it placed 15th, just three places above the relegation zone. Sesko has been compared with former Paris Saint-Germain and United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic because of his height – both are 1.95 metres (6 feet, 5 inches) tall – and flashes of technical skill.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ruled out ceding land to Russia and demanded his country take part in negotiations aimed at ending the war between the neighbours, just days before planned talks between the leaders of Russia and the United States. In a video shared on social media on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for “real decisions” that could bring a “dignified peace” but stressed there could be no violation of the constitution on territorial issues. His comments came hours after US President Donald Trump said a peace deal would involve “some swapping of territories” as he announced a meeting on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the US state of Alaska to discuss the war. Advertisement Previously, the Kremlin has insisted that Ukraine give up the territories Russia occupies, and that Western nations stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and exclude the country from membership in the NATO military alliance. “There has been a lot of speculation over what a ceasefire agreement could look like in which the lines of contact between Russia and Ukraine could be frozen for a number of years,” Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javad reported from Moscow. “It is also not clear whether the Russian demand that NATO’s ambitions in Ukraine should be forever quashed is actually going to be met.” Separately on Saturday, Zelenskyy spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and urged Ukraine’s allies to take “clear steps” towards achieving a sustainable peace. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake.” Meanwhile, national security advisers from Ukrainian allies – including the US, European Union nations and the UK – gathered in Britain on Saturday to align their views ahead of the Putin-Trump summit. Ukraine and its European allies have long opposed any agreement that involves ceding occupied territory, but Putin has repeatedly said any deal must require Ukraine to relinquish some of the territories Russia has seized. Russia declared four Ukrainian regions that it does not fully control – Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Luhansk – its territory in 2022 and also claims the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Advertisement “We have a lot of hope that Trump will make Putin accept a real negotiation and a ceasefire to the conflict,” said Goncharenko, adding that the outcome of the war in Ukraine is crucial for Europe’s security, as well as that of his own country. “I think Europe is clearly on our side and Trump should [keep] Europe on its side.” Meanwhile, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov has said the talks between Putin and Trump next week will “focus on discussing options for achieving a long-term peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian crisis”.

Article: Peter Safar, an Austrian doctor, had just developed the basics of CPR, a lifesaving technique that keeps blood and oxygen flowing to the brain and vital organs after the heart has stopped beating. The Norwegian toymaker had a vision: It needed to look unthreatening, and assuming that men would not want to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a male dummy, it should be a woman. There are many rumours as to how the original mask was created, but one story that has cemented itself as urban legend is that it was of a woman who had supposedly drowned in the Seine River in 19th-century Paris. In the French capital at the time, it was common for the bodies of the deceased who could not be identified to be placed on black marble slabs and displayed in the window of the city’s morgue situated near Notre Dame Cathedral. The French writer Albert Camus called her the “drowned Mona Lisa”, while the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke said of her serene expression, “It was beautiful, because it smiled, because it smiled so deceptively, as if it knew.” Resusci Anne It is not known whether Laderdal was aware of the legend behind the painting in Stavanger, but in 1960, he gave it new life when the first CPR doll was officially launched with the subject’s face.

Pal Oftedal, director of Corporate Communications at Laerdal Medical, says that regardless of whether the story behind Annie is true, she has had a positive impact on engaging people worldwide in the lifesaving practice of CPR.

Article: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signed into law a bill easing environmental licensing rules, but bowed to pressure from activist groups as he vetoed key provisions that would have made it easier for companies to secure environmental permits. Lula approved on Friday what detractors have dubbed the “devastation bill”, but struck down or altered 63 of its nearly 400 articles, his office’s executive secretary, Miriam Belchior, told reporters. The president had faced mounting pressure from environmental groups to intervene in the bill, which was backed by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and focused on rolling back strict licensing rules that had kept the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in check. Lula’s environmental vetoes Of the provisions struck down by Lula, 26 were vetoed outright, while another 37 will either be replaced with alternative text or modified in a new bill that will be sent to Congress for ratification under a constitutional urgency procedure. Lawmakers aligned with embattled ex-president Jair Bolsonaro are also blocking legislative activity amid an escalating political standoff, as they call for the former president’s charges around an alleged failed coup attempt in 2022 to be dropped. Speaking at a Friday news conference in the capital, Brasilia, Environment Minister Marina Silva maintained a positive tone, telling reporters that Lula’s vetoes would ensure that “the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation”. Silva said a previous version of the bill, approved by Congress last month, threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework. But, she said, Lula’s revised version meant Brazil’s “targets to reach zero deforestation” and its goal to “cut CO2 emissions by between 59 percent and 67 percent remain fully on track”.

Article: But even as the ban was followed by police raids on several bookstores in the region’s biggest city, Srinagar, during which they seized books on the blacklist, Indian officials are holding a book festival in the city on the banks of Dal Lake. “Nothing is surprising about this ban, which comes at a moment when the level of censorship and surveillance in Kashmir since 2019 has reached absurd heights,” Kanjwal told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s crackdown on the region since it revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status six years ago. “It is, of course, even more absurd that this ban comes at a time when the Indian army is simultaneously promoting book reading and literature through a state-sponsored Chinar Book Festival.” Yet even with Kashmir’s long history of facing censorship, the book bans represent to many critics a particularly sweeping attempt by New Delhi to assert control over academia in the disputed region. ‘Misguiding youth’ The 25 books banned by the government offer a detailed overview of the events surrounding the Partition of India and the reasons why Kashmir became such an intransigent territorial dispute to begin with. Advertisement They include writings like Azadi by Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy, Human Rights Violations in Kashmir by Piotr Balcerowicz and Agnieszka Kuszewska, Kashmiris’ Fight for Freedom by Mohd Yusaf Saraf, Kashmir Politics and Plebiscite by Abdul Gockhami Jabbar and Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? Then there are books like Kanjwal’s, journalist Anuradha Bhasin’s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 and legal scholar AG Noorani’s The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012, which dissect the region’s political journey over the decades. The government’s order states: “This literature would deeply impact the psyche of youth by promoting a culture of grievance, victimhood, and terrorist heroism.” The dispute in Kashmir dates back to 1947 when the departing British cleaved the Indian subcontinent into the two dominions of India and Pakistan. Muslim-majority Kashmir’s Hindu king sought to be independent of both, but after Pakistan-backed fighters entered a part of the region, he agreed to join India on the condition that Kashmir enjoy a special status within the new union with some autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. Some of Nehru’s decisions that have come under criticism include the unceremonious dismissal of the region’s leader Sheikh Abdullah, who advocated for self-rule for Kashmir, and the decision to replace him with his lieutenant, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, whose 10 years in office were marked by the strengthening of New Delhi’s rule of Indian-administered Kashmir. In 2010, after major protests broke out following the killing of 17-year-old student Tufail Mattoo by security forces, the provincial government banned SMS services and restored them only three years later. At the height of another civil uprising in 2016, the government stopped Kashmir Reader, an independent publication in Srinagar, from going to press, citing its purported “tendency to incite violence”. “First they came for journalists, and realising they were successful in silencing them, they have turned their attention to academia,” said veteran editor Anuradha Bhasin, whose book on India’s revocation of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 is among those banned. “When my book went to print, the legal team vetted it thrice.” ‘A feeling of despair’ The book bans have drawn criticism from various quarters in Kashmir with students and researchers calling it an attempt to impose collective amnesia. “If these works are no longer available to me, my research is naturally going to be lopsided.” On Thursday, videos showed uniformed policemen entering bookstores in Srinagar and asking their proprietors if they possessed any of the books in the banned list. More acclaimed works on the blacklist Historian Sumantra Bose is aghast at the suggestion by Indian authorities that his book Kashmir at the Crossroads has fuelled violence in the region. In 1935, the colonial authorities in British India banned The Indian Struggle, 1920-1934, a compendium of political analysis authored by Subhas Chandra Bose, his great-uncle and a leader of India’s freedom struggle.

Article: While Singapore will bask in some success this weekend, once the flags are taken down and the SG60 merchandise is removed from the shelves, the island-nation will get back to work and begin contemplating its future. Plans are already in motion to continue Singapore’s growth, with its most famous landmark – Marina Bay Sands – set to house a new fourth tower of hotel rooms in 2029, while a 15,000-seat indoor arena will also be built at the site. “If it flooded a lot of the infrastructure in Singapore, closing down MRTs [mass rapid transit], shutting down emergency routes, flooding a power station and the electricity went down – Singapore would be crippled,” Horton said. “The resulting strain will not only test the resilience of healthcare institutions but also place significant emotional, physical, and financial pressure on family caregivers,” said Chuan De Foo, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The fertility rate, which measures the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, fell below 1.0 for the first time in 2023 and shows little sign of increasing. Kalpana Vignehsa, a senior research fellow at NUS’s Institute of Policy Studies think tank, said the Singapore government is “swimming against a cultural tide” in its efforts to reverse the decline in births. While the country’s leaders are likely to stay the same in the near-term, Teo Kay Key, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies Social Lab, said younger Singaporeans will soon want a different style of politics, one that is more open and more participatory.

Article: Twin cathedral bells will ring in unison in Nagasaki for the first time in 80 years, as the Japanese city commemorates the moment the United States decimated it with an atomic bomb eight decades ago. The US dropped an atomic bomb on the southwestern port city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, at 11:02am local time, three days after it dropped a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima. The church in Nagasaki, widely known as Urakami Cathedral, was rebuilt in 1959 after it was almost completely destroyed in the monstrous atomic explosion, the hypocentre of which was just a few hundred metres from the religious building. Spearheading the fundraising campaign for the new church bell was James Nolan – a sociology professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, whose grandfather participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the US’s first nuclear weapons. “It’s not about forgetting the wounds of the past but recognising them and taking action to repair and rebuild, and in doing so, working together for peace,” Yamamura told the AFP news agency.

Article: Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war. They’re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.” Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won’t be easy. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.” Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution. “Putin will say, ‘Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.’ And Trump will say, ‘You’re right about that.’” “Putin is good at those stories,” McFaul continued. That’s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.” Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. Putin may try to “divert President Trump from Trump’s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,” said William Taylor, who was charge d’affaires at the U.S. “Then, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.” No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He’s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he’s an international pariah. “President Trump — just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator — is giving him legitimacy,” McFaul said. At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S and Russia. Citing Putin’s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there “could be other people also” who interfered in the 2016 election.) This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin’s conduct of the war. “If President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he’s got, there could be a ceasefire.” Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared to other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, “will change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.” “That would be a positive diversion,” Coons added. “But it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.” An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.

Article: Marina Boland, 29, who lives across a highway from the prison, said, “It’s scary to think” that someone would be motivated to come to Bryan in connection with the controversies linked to Epstein, the wealthy financier who had cultivated friendships and relationships with powerful people, from business leaders to presidents. In recent weeks, the release of files related to Epstein has become a politically charged debate after the Trump administration said it would not put out all of the documents detailing the federal government’s investigation into him. Maxwell herself returned to the spotlight after it was revealed that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with her last month for nine hours over two days in a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. That stoked outrage among some current and former federal Bureau of Prisons employees who question why she would be placed there given her sex offense charges and the higher level of security she requires. Other residents questioned why Maxwell — w​​ho isn’t slated for release until July 2037, when she would be 75 — would get moved to a prison camp where security has traditionally been lax.

Article: Earnhardt family disputes aside, the fight in Mooresville echoes similar debates across the country as communities grapple with the potential economic benefits and environmental downsides of giant data centers that are swallowing land and resources to feed America’s insatiable demand for computing power. Crowds of people have packed meetings from Arizona to Alabama to express fears that these projects could overtax the electric grid, pollute the water and air, and generally disrupt their rural peace with hulking structures emitting a high-tech hum. The consulting company McKinsey said in April that it forecasts roughly $7 trillion in global spending on data centers in the next five years, sparked in large part by demand for processing power to meet the needs of tech companies racing to build and develop advanced artificial intelligence systems. In Oldham County, Kentucky, a data center developer pulled out of a project last month and the county’s fiscal court passed a moratorium on data centers after community pushback over environmental concerns. “The volume, speed, and effectiveness of local opposition are reshaping the landscape of political risks for the data center industry,” Data Center Watch said in a statement to NBC News. Sarah Lapidus / USA Today Network Wendy Reigel, an activist in Chesterton, Indiana, routinely gives advice to other communities fighting data centers after she started a successful movement against a $1.3 billion project in her town last year. “In the end, people need hope,” she said, “and then they need information, and then they got to work their rear ends off.” That’s what the organizers in Mooresville have been doing.

Article: ABOVE NORTHERN GAZA — From the sky, a besieged Gaza briefly came into view early Saturday as the military plane opened its back door and a mass of tents could be seen near the Mediterranean coast from a side window. But with mounting international outrage about deaths from starvation in Gaza under Israel’s offensive and crippling aid restrictions, several countries have started dropping food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza from the sky. Burney, who has been treating patients in Gaza for the past week as part of a team with MedGlobal, a Chicago-based nonprofit that arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, added that he had taken care of “multiple patients who’ve been crushed by these sort of unplanned, unannounced aid drops on top of their heads, literally on top of their heads.” Saturday’s flight from an air base just outside the Jordanian capital Amman took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government faced a wave of condemnation from European leaders, Arab nations and a group representing the families of hostages after it announced plans to take control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the plan on Friday as a “dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.” His colleague Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also said in a statement that “the Israeli Government should put all its efforts into saving the lives of Gaza’s civilians by allowing the full, unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.” Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas. It lifted the blockade in May, allowing a basic amount of aid into Gaza, largely distributed under a controversial new distribution system led by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an update Tuesday. Omar Al-Qattaa / AFP - Getty Images Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to “distribute aid to Gaza residents independently.” It said that after “incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted” and that “systematic learning processes” to improve the operational response are underway. Aid groups have also pointed out that the drops can only provide a fraction of what is required for Gaza’s population of around 2 million people as the hunger crisis continues to spiral and much of the enclave plunge into famine conditions. Chantal Da Silva / NBC News Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told journalists Thursday that at least 99 people, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year. Israel has maintained there is no starvation in Gaza and that the situation on the ground is being exaggerated, almost 22 months after it launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. Bashar Taleb / AFP - Getty Images Since then, more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed.

Article: Arizona police on Friday released new details about the fatal May drowning of influencer Emilie Kiser’s 3-year-old son, including allegations that her husband placed a $25 bet on an NBA playoff game before the tragic incident. Brady Kiser, the husband of the parenting influencer, was home with the couple’s two sons while his wife was out with friends on May 12 when Trigger drowned in the family’s backyard pool, according to the Chandler Police Department report unsealed on Friday. Police initially recommended that Kiser be charged with one count of child abuse, but the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office later determined that he would not face charges because there was “no reasonable likelihood of conviction.” Kiser’s lawyer previously said that he is “grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident.” According to the report obtained by People magazine, Kiser called the police around 6:41 p.m. In a series of subsequent interviews, Kiser detailed his day to officers after his wife left to meet friends, including feeding his kids dinner and sitting on the couch while watching Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics. It wasn’t that he had been out of sight for long.” Surveillance footage, however, showed that Trigger was unsupervised for at least nine minutes, and had been in the water for at least seven before Kiser found him, the report states. Around that same time, according to Kiser’s phone data detailed in the report, “a $25 wager was placed on Jayson Tatum scoring more than 40 points” on a sports betting app at around 5:14 p.m. The report states that the “wager was a winner, paying $102.50.” The report states that the incident was the result of Trigger being “unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim.” “It is clear Brady’s attention was divided,” the report added. The report’s release came one day after the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County ruled in Emilie Kiser’s favor after she requested to seal certain details about hr son’s death.

Article: Ventura County officials said Friday that firefighters were making “good progress in suppressing the blaze, aided by favorable weather conditions and the continued use of firefighting aircraft making repeated water and retardant drops to slow the fire’s advance and support crews on the ground.” Still, the fire remains an active threat and continues to spread further east into L.A. County Fire Department said three firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze and were taken to a local hospital “out of an abundance of caution,” but were expected to fully recover. Air quality issues are expected to linger through Sunday morning, according to the agency, which monitors air quality conditions for much of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Air pollution from wildfire smoke is a significant concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter — around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair.

Article: After starting 0-2 in five of its last six seasons, the team seemed to agree with criticism that trying to preserve its roster’s preseason health had stunted its readiness for the regular season. “It’s ridiculous.” Yet the Bengals’ shift in preseason philosophy isn’t the norm in a league where the preseason is getting started, but many of the biggest names will likely not. Inside the league, blame or praise for the trend of sharply reducing or outright eliminating starters’ preseason workloads is often attributed to Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay, who began holding out his best players entirely during the preseason in his second season in Los Angeles in 2018, even though the Rams were starting a young quarterback. Los Angeles went on to advance to the Super Bowl, and whether the preseason rest for key players was connected at all to its play during the regular season, it was enough in a copycat league — where new ideas do not stay proprietary for long — for others to adopt the same approach. During the 2024 preseason, 14 teams didn’t play their presumed starter for a single snap during the first two weeks of the preseason — up from just one team in 2014, according to a comparison done last year. “Sometimes what you do in practice and then play in a game is a whole different aspect.” McVay and the Rams might not have put their top players on ice during preseason games if not for the rise of another trend happening at the same time, as franchises increasingly began hosting “joint practices.” Their appeal stemmed from the opportunity for quality repetitions but in a more controlled scrimmage than a game. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams said he believed preseason “reps are always paramount for anybody like myself: a young rookie, second-year guy, [or] third-year guy.” Yet this year, as a second-year guy playing under a new head coach in Chicago, the quarterback will not play in the Bears’ preseason opener. This month, 30 of the 32 teams will play three preseason games — only the Los Angeles Chargers and Detroit Lions, who also played in the July 31 Hall of Fame exhibition, will play more — and many have signaled that they will again play starters and stars sparingly, if at all. He reportedly offered to play, but was among a group of 15 starters who will sit out at least the first preseason game because “they need less runway to take off, to be quite honest with you,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. A player as good as Burrow would seemingly need little proverbial runway, either, but he has called the Bengals’ change of philosophy “the right decision.” But not everyone is altering their approach to the preseason.

Article: As she juggled temp jobs, financial anxiety and a society that resisted making room for her, Butler wrote genre-defining literature that has been adapted for TV and film in recent years, and has continued to go viral nearly two decades after her death in 2006 at 58. “Positive Obsession,” named for a 1989 essay by Butler, pulls from journals, interviews and personal letters in Butler’s public archives to illuminate the forces that shaped her, revealing an ambitious and meticulous writer. Chrissandra Jallah For most of her career, Butler woke up before dawn to write for hours ahead of what she once called “lots of horrible little jobs.” As she toiled in factories and warehouses, washing dishes, inspecting potato chips and making telemarketing calls, Butler conjured characters from her everyday encounters. Morris told NBC that in sharing Butler’s story now, 19 years after her death, she hopes to inspire artists who don’t think they can afford to create to find the time. “In this economic system that we’re currently in, we are so crunched down trying to buy eggs or pay the rent,” Morris said “sometimes we don’t even feel like we can access art for art’s sake. Her novel “Kindred” was reimagined into a TV series in 2022, and authors John Jennings and Damian Duffy won a Hugo Award in 2021 for their graphic novel reimagining of her book “Parable of the Sower.” “Positive Obsession: The Life and Times of Octavia E. In “Parable of the Talents,” published in 1998 and set in the 2020s, Butler introduces a conservative presidential candidate who urges voters to join him in a project to “make America great again.” The words on the page reverberated through Morris’ classroom as she taught the book during Trump’s first presidency. Absolutely.” Morris uses the 1987 short story “The Evening and the Morning and the Night” — about a community grappling with a fictional genetic disorder — to talk to students about the marginalization of people with disabilities. Though often shelved as science fiction, Morris says Butler’s work transcends the label, and she instead classifies it as “speculative fiction.” Morris’ immersive portrait can at times feel like reading Butler’s journal or listening to the innermost thoughts of a quiet and sometimes lonely person. “I hope that in this world that is often devoid of beauty,” Morris said, “that other folks can see her example and find the beauty in their own kind of practice.”

Article: When Sheffield Wednesday FC kicks off the new season on Sunday — away at Leicester City in the Championship, the second tier of British soccer — more than 3,000 traveling fans will not take their seats to cheer on their beloved team, known as the Owls. Instead, they will hold a five-minute protest outside Leicester’s King Power Stadium against one man: Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, Wednesday’s owner and the focal point of a growing crisis that may threaten its very existence. The team’s financial problems are mounting, and unsuccessful attempts to sell it have dominated local sports media and online forums for months — and the crisis has much wider implications for the health of English soccer away from the glitzy riches of Liverpool and Manchester City. The problem is so acute that the British government has passed a new law that will launch a football regulator to police the buying and selling of teams and make sure owners are “fit and proper.” For Wednesday, founded in 1867, that could be too little, too late. Some teams have bad offseasons, but this summer has seen Wednesday set new levels of chaos: Players and staff have not been paid on time in four of the last five months. At least 15 players have left on free transfers or for a fraction of their market value this summer, leaving barely enough players to fill a match day squad of 11 starters and up to nine substitutes. “It’s becoming a soap opera,” said Dan Fudge, who co-hosts the popular podcast “The Wednesday Week.” “Usually, as podcasters, we’re scratching for content to talk about during the summer,” Fudge said, “but we seem to have had a new timeline of terror every single week to talk about.” The list of mishaps goes on. The famous old Hillsborough Stadium is literally falling apart — Sheffield City Council refused to grant a safety license for the vast 9,000-seat North Stand due to concerns of uncovering wiring and cracks in the terrace. Kieran Maguire, a leading British football finance expert and commentator, puts the real value at 40 million pounds ($53 million), but Chansiri said in June that he rejected an offer at this price from a U.S.-based consortium. Maguire said it was unlikely Wednesday would go bust entirely, but he said that in any case the team would almost certainly be relegated to the league below and face a very tough season. This summer alone, the 20 Premier League teams have spent around 1.8 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on transfer fees, with reigning champions Liverpool splashing out 252 million pounds ($335 million). Between them, the Premier League clubs made more than 6 billion pounds ($8 billion) in revenue in the 2024-25 season, an increase of 36% from the previous year, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. The league, criticized by some fans for not acting sooner, warned the Thai magnate that the club needed to “meet its obligations or make good on his commitment to sell to a well-funded party, for fair market value.” Could things even get worse? This week, Morecambe FC, a team in the northwest seaside town of the same name, was suspended from the National League, the fifth tier of English football’s sprawling pyramid-shaped league system, with the elite clubs at the top and smaller, more parochial clubs toward the bottom. “Then, over recent years, you look at teams like Bury and what’s recently happened to Morecambe, and they’ve not had that white knight step in, and all of a sudden we’re thinking, ‘Oh hang on a minute, we could be the big scalp.’” Like many fans, Fudge has no doubt who is to blame. “Pure ineptitude is how we’ve got here, regardless of the warning signs around Chansiri since about 2018.” Fans warmly remember the 1990s, when players such as Chris Waddle, David Hirst and Des Walker — all England internationals — lined up alongside some of the then-hottest talent in Europe, helping the club reach seventh place in the Premier League during the 1996-97 season. David Blunkett, a senior minister during Tony Blair’s government in the 1990s and 2000s and now a member of the House of Lords, is a lifelong Wednesday fan and attended an online meeting with the football league on Thursday. “Parliamentarians, including those representing the city, the Supporters’ Trust and other fans will clearly continue to pressurize for an immediate resolution of the crisis at Hillsborough,” he told NBC News. Hailing from the north side of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, a city famous for its steel, Wednesday became an early member of the Football Association (the term “soccer” is an abbreviation of “association”), as the football craze swept through working-class communities across the North and the Midlands. The team got its unique name from cricket: In the mid-19th century, there were multiple teams in Sheffield playing this game, and the one that played on Wednesdays started a football team. “There’s a lot of people that are very much in the camp of ‘Let’s protest, let’s get this message out as much as we can,’ which I completely agree with, but it’s not everybody’s bag, because a lot of people use the football to spend time with their family and their friends,” Fudge said.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. “I have so many people who come to me and say to me, ‘I love your music, I want to give, but I’m sorry, I don’t carry cash,’” said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. Evie Steele for NBC News There’s no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. “I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, ‘Thank you,’ because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away,” Deitz said. “But then people that didn’t pay see those people walk away, and they go, ‘Well, I guess it’s acceptable to walk away.’” For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. “People would stop and talk to us.” Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. “You might think that it’s worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you’re getting cash out of your wallet and you’re fumbling around for change.” But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think “tipping culture is out of control.” That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.

The best hydrating products for dogs Best water bowl Ensuring your dog has access to fresh water at all times is important regardless of the weather, but it becomes even more crucial when it’s hot out — dogs tend to drink more during high temperatures to stay hydrated, so be sure to refill their bowl often, says Kaplan. Petlibro’s water fountain has a 2.1-gallon capacity, and between Mabel and my two cats drinking out of it, I refill it every few days by pouring water directly into the serving tray. PupFlask’s dishwasher-safe dog water bottle comes in two sizes (27 and 40 ounces) and it’s composed of two parts: a stainless steel bottle that stores water and a silicone lid that folds into a drinking bowl. Best cooling enrichment toy In addition to drinking water, licking ice cubes and other frozen treats can keep dogs hydrated, plus it gives them an engaging indoor activity to do if it’s too hot for outdoor play or walks. The spherical-shaped rubber toy rolls around while dogs use it so they have to work for their frozen treat, keeping them entertained for 15 to 30 minutes, in my experience. The best sun protection products for dogs Best dog booties Ruffwear Grip Trex Dog Boots $ 44.95 Amazon What to know What we like Breathable fabric Thick, grippy outsole Multiple sizes available Something to note Uncomfortable for some dogs Booties protect dogs’ paws from hot pavement, and Ruffwear sells one of Bonomo’s favorite pairs. Musher’s Secret Dog Paw Wax is made with natural waxes and oils like vitamin E and beeswax, ingredients that create an invisible protective barrier on paw pads and keep them soft so they don’t dry out, according to the brand. Sunscreen can help protect your pup from UV rays, so long as you use an option that’s specifically made for dogs — some ingredients in sunscreen for humans are toxic to dogs if ingested, like zinc oxide, which is often in mineral sunscreen, according to the American Kennel Club. Best UPF clothing DogZStuff Dog Cooling Vest with UV Protection $ 24.95 Amazon What to know What we like Dog sunscreen alternative Doubles as a cooling towel Multiple sizes available Something to note Nothing to note at this time UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) measures a product’s ability to block sunlight, and UPF clothing, hats and goggles can act as an alternative to dog sunscreen if you find it challenging to apply, experts say. How to keep dogs cool: The top do’s and don’ts, according to vets Regardless of whether you live in a warm climate year-round or temperatures are rising in your area due to seasonality, your goal as a dog owner is to prevent your pet from overheating in the first place instead of working to cool them down afterward, says Kaplan. In extreme temperatures, like those you may experience during a heat wave, only take your dog outside for about five to 10 minutes, or just enough time to relieve themselves, says Satchu. Once you factor in humidity, 70-degree temperatures, which may be relatively comfortable for us, can feel much warmer for dogs since their average body temperatures are naturally a few degrees higher than humans, experts told me. Thus, 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the absolute maximum indoor temperature dogs should be exposed to if necessary — it should not be their norm, and it’s only safe if they have access to plenty of fresh water, can lay on cool surfaces like tile floors and are not exposed to direct sunlight, says Kratt. That’s why it’s important to check on your dog when they spend time outside and keep an eye out for telltale signs they’re overheating, including: Anxiousness or relentlessness Excessive panting and drooling Rapid breathing Vomiting or diarrhea Abnormal gum and tongue color Unsteadiness, disorientation and collapse If you’re concerned that your dog is severely overheating or experiencing heatstroke, take them inside immediately and bring them to a veterinarian, says Kratt.

For example, after proving that you’re enrolled at a college through your school email address or student ID, you can create an Amazon Prime Student account, which offers benefits like fast shipping and exclusive prices on select products. Not all bedding retailers carry products in twin XL sizes, so you should always check which brands carry fitted sheets, flat sheets and other bedding to fit your dorm bed. After living in dorms for years, both Yi and Malin have gained knowledge of which products worked and didn’t, as well as the products they could have used but didn’t have at the time.

The best cushioned running shoes Best overall The New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 may have a mouthful of a name, but they are excellent running shoes available in a variety of colors. The best supportive running shoes Best for wide feet and bunions These cushioned, chunky shoes have a spacious and wide toe box — Cunha recommends them for people with wide feet or bunions. These shoes strike a great balance between cushion and responsiveness — I feel fast, but not so connected to the pavement that every nook and cranny feels like a surprise. Try them on in-person Both Cunha and Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City, recommend going to a local running shoe store for the best fit possible. “It doesn’t matter if they still look new: if the support is worn out, you’re at a much higher risk of injury.” To keep track of when it’s time to replace your shoes, note the date you buy a new pair, and keep track of that six-month interval, says Cunha.

Article: As Southern California continued to experience a heat wave, officials on Saturday lifted the final evacuation orders in areas affected by the Canyon fire, which has burned more than 5,000 acres in northern Los Angeles and Ventura counties. With the fire about 28% contained, overnight fire activity was “minimal” and crews worked to further secure the perimeter, protect structures and look for hot spots, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Advertisement Battalion Chief James Agee of the Kern County Fire Department was seriously injured Friday when the pickup truck he was driving rolled over in the Romero Canyon area in Castaic, where he was involved in a team effort to monitor Canyon fire along the ridge line, a fire official said. Andrew Freeborn, a public information officer for the Kern County Fire Department, did not confirm Agee’s assignment, but said he was in a “lead position for a task force, which was made up of five fire engines and approximately 17 people.” Agee was driving by himself when the truck rolled over into steep terrain. “James is a strong man with a big heart, and we know he’s facing this challenge with the same strength and character he’s shown throughout his career,” said Kern County Fire Chief Aaron Duncan in a statement. “We are grateful for the swift actions of our crews and partner agencies, and for the kindness being shown to his family.” Advertisement Agee is in stable condition but still being treated for his serious injuries, the public information officer said Saturday. “But then you look at the response and how quickly care is then provided because our firefighters are all very well trained, and sometimes our training is applied to ourselves.” The region’s hot spell hampered efforts to quell the fire, triggering poor air conditions , according to the National Weather Service. Advertisement Inland valley areas were expected to see triple-digit temperatures throughout the weekend, with forecast highs of 106 in Lancaster and 103 in Northridge, according to the National Weather Service . “There is a moderate risk for heat related illnesses for vulnerable populations, and any fire starts in interior areas could grow rapidly, as we saw with the Canyon Fire on Thursday,” the National Weather Service said on X.

Article: Though it was not yet noon, the temperature was already inching toward triple digits, and it felt even hotter for the scores of farmworkers hunched in the rows of watermelon plants in this field tucked by a bend in the Sacramento River north of California’s capital. Their boss, Jose Chavez, said he tries to be vigilant about the danger of heat illness, making sure there is plenty of drinking water in the fields and that workers can take breaks in the shade and knock off early on blistering days. “When you start taking people to the hospital, it’s not fun.” That lesson, however, has not stuck with many employers, and 20 years after California enacted a landmark heat safety law, farmworkers across the state are still getting sick and sometimes dying from preventable heat illness. Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), a former farmworker who carried legislation last year that would have made it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation if they were stricken by heat illness on the job. People are dying.” Last month, the California state auditor blasted the California Department of Occupational Health and Safety , finding, among other problems, that the agency’s inspectors failed to take proper action when workers suffered heat illness on the job. Advertisement The enforcement lapses come at a time when farmworkers — many of whom lack legal status and fear deportation — are already hesitant to voice complaints about working conditions, fearful that employers could retaliate by reporting them to immigration authorities. This week, as the hottest temperatures of the summer descend just as harvest season hits its peak — and at a time when the Trump administration has stepped up immigration raids across California — some say farm laborers face more risks that ever. Cruz was the fourth farmworker to die in that brutal summer 20 years ago, in which heat deaths also claimed a man picking bell peppers in Arvin, a melon picker in Fresno County and a grape picker in Kern County. Advertisement The rules, which were the first of their kind in the country, require bosses to provide outdoor workers with fresh water, access to shade when the temperatures climb, and breaks to cool off whenever workers request them. In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers union sued Cal/OSHA, saying the statute was too weak and the agency’s enforcement was “woefully inadequate.” The suit said 11 farmworkers had died since the law went into effect. Three years later, the nonprofit law firm Public Counsel filed another suit, alleging that the state’s failure to enforce the problems had persisted, and that farmworkers were continuing to die. Of more than 1,200 workers surveyed, 43% reported that their employers had not provided a heat illness prevention plan and 15% said they had not received heat illness prevention training. It’s excuse after excuse, year after year.” This year, Assemblywoman Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced another proposed law, similar to the one Newson vetoed last year, making it easier for farmworkers to receive workers’ compensation.

Advertisement “Silence is Violence” “Migrants Don’t Party With Epstein” Cynthia Lunine, 70, carried a large sign that read “Break His Dark Spell” and included a sinister image of President Trump. Advertisement But the administration’s blather about a focus on violent offenders led to huge demonstrations in greater Los Angeles beginning in June, and the cause continues to draw people into the streets.

Once a week, Nicholls helps organize a rally that includes a march through the parking lot and into the store, where the protesters present a letter asking Home Depot management to “say no to ICE in their parking lot and in their store.” Nicholls is an LAUSD teacher-librarian, and when she asks for support each week, working and retired teachers answer the call. “I’m yelling my lungs out,” said retired teacher Mary Rose O’Leary, who joined in the chants of “ICE out of Home Depot” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” Sharon Nicholls gets a hug of support from another protester outside the Home Depot in Pasadena. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) “Immigrants are what make this city what it is … and the path to legal immigration is closed to everybody who doesn’t have what, $5 million or something?” O’Leary said, adding that she was motivated by “the Christian ideal of welcoming the stranger.” Advertisement Retired teacher Dan Murphy speaks Spanish and regularly checks in with day laborers. “One guy said to me, ‘We’re just here to work.’ Some of the guys were like, ‘We’re not criminals … we’re just here … to make money and get by,’” Murphy said. And it bothers me what might happen in this country if people don’t stand firm … I just said, ‘I gotta do something.’ I’m doing this now so I don’t hate myself later.” Nicholls told me she was an activist many years ago, and then turned her focus to work and raising a family. “You’d see them in orange shirts all over the city, cleaning up.” The East Pasadena Home Depot is “an important store,” because it’s a supply center for the rebuilding of Altadena, “and we’re going out there to show our love and solidarity for our neighbors,” Nicholls said. To strike the fear of deportation in the hearts of workers, she said, is “inhumane, and to me, it’s morally wrong.” Nicholls had a quick response when I asked what she thinks of those who say illegal is illegal, so what’s left to discuss? When the raids began, Nicholls said, she told her husband, “I have the summer off, sweetie, but I want to help, and I’m going to call my friends.” On Wednesday, after Nicholls welcomed demonstrators, Alvarado showed up for a pep talk. “Some people may say that we are going into fascism, into authoritarianism, and I would say that we are already there.” He offered details of a raid that morning at a Home Depot in Westlake and said the question is not whether the Pasadena store will be raided, but when.

Article: The plan would almost double the company’s current timetable of 50 rockets a year, despite clashing with the California Coastal Commission over concerns about the impact that the blasts could have on coastal wildlife, and on nearby residents who have reported startling sonic booms with the already steep rise in launches. But the Air Force and SpaceX have quickly moved to dramatically increase the number of rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force in Santa Barbara County, asking the commission to agree to 36, then to 50, and now 95 rocket blasts a year. The fast uptick in rocket launches off the California coast has put the space exploration company, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in direct conflict with the California Coastal Commission, whose members have raised concerns about the impact of the launches, the lack of monitoring and whether the privately owned company is circumventing the permit process because it is a federal contractor, despite most of the rocket launches involving no equipment or missions for U.S. During the October meeting, commissioners cited concerns that Musk had inserted himself into the presidential race, spread conspiracy theories on social media and faced serious allegations that employees at his companies have been mistreated. Commissioners have also pointed to reports that Musk’s company, Starlink, had refused to allow Ukraine to use satellite internet service to help carry out an attack against Russia in 2022, and questioned whether Musk’s decisions did not directly conflict with those of a U.S. Advertisement Cooperation between the state commission and the Department of Air Force also seems to have flailed after the October meeting, with little agreement or communication between the two agencies. During the October meeting when the commission rejected the plan for 50 launches, officials from the base said they had hoped to work with the commission to address seven conditions that had been requested from the U.S. Advertisement The plan for more launches, submitted by the Air Force to the commission, would also double the number of landing events at the military base, which have also been reported to generate their own sonic boom blast. According to the staff report, the base expects 24 SpaceX rocket landing events a year at Vandenberg, including 12 first-stage booster landings and five Falcon Heavy missions that would have two boosters landing simultaneously at the base. On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission is scheduled to consider SpaceX’s plan to fire 95 rockets a year, but military officials are expected to move forward with the plan despite the panel’s decision. Military officials have argued that the SpaceX launches should be considered federal activity because all of the launches — even those done for the private benefit of Musk’s company, Starlink — also benefit U.S. A previous staff report from the commission stated that 87% of SpaceX launches from Vandenberg weren’t carrying equipment or conducting missions for government agencies, but were carrying equipment for Starlink. launch providers continue to innovate, offering agile, service-based solutions that operate at the ‘speed of need.’ ” Staff for the coastal commission are expected to again raise concerns about the doubling of rocket launches from the base, arguing that military officials and SpaceX are not providing enough information about the impacts on wildlife, are failing to do enough monitoring to measure the impacts and reach of sonic booms, and that SpaceX should seek permits for its launches because it is conducting them for private benefit, not for the federal government. “Rather, the existing available information indicates that the proposed launch cadence’s primary purpose is to further expand and support SpaceX’s commercial satellite internet and telecommunications network, Starlink.” Despite the pending lawsuit, staff for the coastal commission continue to argue in its report that launches by SpaceX should be regulated as a private company.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed the operations in a statement to The Times on Saturday, calling them “targeted immigration raids” that resulted in the arrests of seven undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. Advertisement Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said four of those individuals had criminal records, including for driving under the influence of alcohol, disorderly conduct and failing to adhere to previous removal orders. Advertisement “In Los Angeles right now — today, as a matter of fact — we have agents out on the streets right now making apprehensions, as you and I are speaking,” he said. “They’re doing that again, legally, ethically and morally.” California ‘They run, we chase’: Immigration raids test limits of ‘probable cause’ The masked agents tackling day laborers at Home Depot and chasing workers at car washes are accused of using people’s race, language, jobs and location as probable causes that they are undocumented. A number of unmarked white vans started circling the parking lot and immigration agents began “grabbing people first and then asking people for ID” said Ortiz, adding that her organization has confirmed 10 people were taken. “It is very clear they are targeting day laborers and they are targeting the organization.” Advertisement Ortiz said immigration agents conducted another raid near a Home Depot in Cypress Park on Saturday. district judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. The Trump administration has since appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the ruling “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Following the temporary restraining order, Southern California saw a significant drop in the number of undocumented immigrants arrested. Then on Wednesday, Customs and Border Protection agents burst out of a Penske rental truck and detained day laborers at a Westlake Home Depot in a raid dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse.” Immigration protests grew heated at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly around 9 p.m. “Our communities deserve dignity and to not be harassed.” At a news conference Friday, Feldstein Soto said that video from the Westlake raid appeared to show the Trump administration violating the court’s temporary restraining order but noted that the matter was still under investigation. Advertisement “We are very cognizant of the fact that that Penske truck seemed to be engaged in a lot of the exact behavior that the language of the TRO specifically prohibits,” she said. A Penske spokesman previously told The Times that the company was not aware its trucks would be used in the operation and had not authorized the federal government to do so. “The Border Patrol, CBP and our allied law enforcement partners, when we conduct law enforcement operations, we always abide by the law — whether it’s a temporary restraining order ... “We’re going after it, and that’s exactly what we did.” Advertisement He said that of the 16 people apprehended during Operation Trojan Horse, at least six had “significant immigration and criminal histories.” He said this reflects the trend seen in larger immigration operations, where 30% to 40% of people arrested typically have significant immigration and criminal histories.

Business California’s economy is already getting hit by immigration raids The number of people reporting to work in the private sector in California has decreased by 3.1% — a downturn only recently matched by the COVID-19 lockdown. A California Department of Food and Agriculture survey conducted during fall 2024 revealed that up to 32 rats were captured per night at some almond orchards, leading to tree damage from burrowing in the root zone, consuming nuts and disrupting the tree’s vascular system.

The director of UCLA Library Special Collections received notice from the head of the university’s East Asian Library that three rare Chinese books were missing after being last checked out by someone named “Alan Fujimori.” Advertisement According to the FBI affidavit, security camera analysis from library staff revealed that Fujimori, Austin Chen, and Jason Wang, who had all checked out valuable manuscripts over the years, were all aliases for one person— Ying. Through a travel record investigation, FBI officials said they discovered that Ying traveled back and forth from China within several days of the alleged robberies, presumably to sell or transport the books. Over the course of October to December of last year, federal investigation detailed in the FBI affidavit found that Ying checked out six books under the alias “Jason Wang.” On Aug. UCLA police were already tipped off of suspicious behavior — by the time Ying arrived to pick up his eight books before his flight, authorities were called and promptly arrested him.

He noted that while Democrats still support the state’s independent redistricting commission, they must counter Trump’s plan in GOP-led states to give their party a better chance in next year’s midterm election. California California’s redrawn congressional districts could be bad news for these Republicans California could add as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats and leave Republicans with four of the state’s 52 House seats, down from the current roster of nine. Advertisement “Gavin Newsom is a loser of the highest order and he will never be president, no matter how hard he prostitutes himself to the press,” said the spokesperson, Steven Cheung. Friday marked the second time in two weeks that Texas Democrats have stood next to Newsom at the California governor’s mansion and warned that Republican efforts to draw a new map in their state would dilute the power of Black and brown voters. Advertisement “We are now facing threats — the threat that we’re going to lose our jobs, the threat of financial ruin, the threat that we will be hunted down as our colleagues sit on their hands and remain silent, as we all get personal threats to our lives,” said Texas state Rep. “We as Democrats are standing up to ensure that the voices of every voter is lifted up in this next election, and that the next election is not stolen from them.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco); Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San José), chair of the California Democratic congressional delegation; California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg); state Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) and other elected officials joined the meeting in a show of unity as California Democrats attempt to convince their own state’s voters to fight back.

Advertisement If approved by voters, the measure would include a “trigger” specifying that it would take effect only if Texas or other Republican-led states follow through with redrawing their maps to boost GOP seats before the midterm election. “I’m confident we’ll get it when people know what it is and what it’s not, and I think, at the end of the day, they understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said Thursday. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday evening, Abbott vowed “to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.” In addition to arrest on civil warrants, the Democrats are facing threats of being removed from office. The redistricting fight has strengthened Newsom’s national platform as a potential 2028 presidential contender and bolstered his reputation as a Democrat willing to take the fight to Trump and his allies. Since Trump took office in January, Newsom had been walking a fine line between calling out the president and working with him in hopes of being able to join together to rebuild from the California wildfires. But Newsom took a hard line after Trump deployed the National Guard during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles in June, prompting the governor and his administration to much more aggressively resist the president’s agenda.

Advertisement Details about the alleged kidnapping are murky, but several department sources — who requested anonymity to discuss the open case — said Halem is also being investigated in connection with home invasions that occurred in the West Valley Division, where he worked until several years ago. In an unattributed statement sent Friday afternoon in response to questions from The Times, the LAPD confirmed Halem’s arrest but said it was “not related to the Departments investigation into residential burglaries in the west valley.” Advertisement “This matter remains under investigation, and we will not be providing further details at this time,” the statement said. The West Valley includes Encino, an affluent area that has been on edge following a series of home break-ins, including one that caused the deaths of “American Idol” music supervisor Robin Kaye and her rock musician husband, Tom DeLuca. Emmett was the subject of a 2022 Times investigation and subsequent Hulu documentary that surfaced allegations of abuse against women and assistants as well as mistreatment of assistants and business partners. Around the same time, Halem landed small roles in TV shows like “Vanderpump Rules” and “Midnight in the Switchgrass.” Earlier this year he and his brother were charged with insurance fraud over what prosecutors alleged was an elaborate insurance fraud scheme related to a Bentley crash in January 2023. Eric Halem ran several car rental companies, Kaypr and Drive LA, which boasted a fleet of rare, luxury vehicles, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a neon green Lamborghini Urus. After the rental driver’s insurance claim was denied because of a lack of proper coverage, Eric Halem filed a fraudulent claim for more than $200,000 with his insurance company on his personal policy, misrepresenting details of the accident, authorities allege.

A black-and-yellow banner covering a billboard on the 91 Freeway in Corona boldly states: “Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney,” according to a photo that one Corona resident shared with ABC7. Note “genes,” not “jeans.” It’s worth remembering that President Trump during a 2020 presidential debate ordered the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” when pressed about condemning right-wing violent extremists. Posters for the American Eagle campaign also featured the totally innovative, never-before-seen wordplay on “jeans” and genes.” A slogan reads, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes,” with the final word crossed out and replaced with “jeans.” Advertisement Sweeney, who seems to have a penchant for odd marketing opportunities, and the ads quickly faced criticism on social media, with users alleging the campaign leaned into the language of eugenics. In an attempt to quell the ire, American Eagle posted a statement stating that its campaign “is and always was about the jeans.” Sweeney and the American Eagle campaign notably found support among the conservative crowd — it wasn’t the first time for the 27-year-old “Immaculate” actor. In an earlier version of his post, Trump misspelled the actor’s name as “Sidney Sweeney.” He also used the post to diss brands he claimed used “woke” marketing, including Jaguar and Bud Light.

President Trump is “trying to silence academic freedom” by “attacking one of the most important public institutions in the United States of America,” Newsom said, adding that he would “stand tall and push back against that, and I believe every member of California Legislature feels the same way.” Advertisement California UCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant negotiations, Newsom says Making his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do ‘the right thing.’ The federal government on Friday said UC should pay the billion-dollar fine in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In addition, the Trump administration demanded sweeping campus changes encompassing protests, admissions, gender identity in sports and housing, the abolition of scholarships for racial or ethnic groups, and submission to an outside monitor over the agreement, according to four UC senior officials who have reviewed the proposal. Advertisement The governor appeared to be referring to controversial and costly deals the Trump administration secured from Columbia and Brown universities over charges similar to those facing UCLA, deals Newsom criticized a day earlier in public remarks. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump’s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,” Milliken said. economy, and protect our national security.” Advertisement UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times the university was still willing to negotiate with the Trump administration but not on “unacceptable” terms. “Demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA, coupled with conditions that contradict the university’s values, is unacceptable,” Reilly said, describing it as a “financial burden” that would be “catastrophic for our students, research, our patients and the people of California. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. So how does that make sense?” Advertisement But another senior UC official said the figure was understandable if it resolved all federal investigations across the system, even if UC may not ultimately agree to it. UC and individual campuses are under multiple federal investigations into alleged use of race in admissions, employment discrimination against Jews, civil rights complaints from Jewish students and improper reporting of foreign donations. The encampment, which unsuccessfully demanded the university divest from weapons companies tied to Israel’s war in Gaza, was targeted in a violent overnight attack last spring and was later the subject of federal lawsuit by pro-Israel Jewish students. The Trump administration’s Friday offer follows a similar playbook to agreements it reached with Columbia and Brown universities to restore federal funding and resolve allegations of civil rights violations against Jewish and Israeli students.

Friday, crews had reached 28% containment on the 5,370-acre Canyon fire burning near Castaic, which broke out amid a heat wave Thursday and has destroyed at least two buildings and injured three firefighters, according to the L.A. Evacuation orders affecting around 2,700 residents have been downgraded to warnings, while evacuation warnings affecting around 14,000 residents have been lifted, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “I think residents in the area can be thankful for the firefighters that came here to help serve them.” Advertisement At 6:20 p.m., a single vehicle rolled over at the scene of the fire and one person was taken to a hospital for treatment, Dowd said. According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, smoke from the Canyon fire is causing unhealthy air quality in Los Angeles County, primarily in the 5 Freeway corridor near Castaic Lake. Taking advantage of cooler temperatures Thursday night into Friday morning, crews were able to make inroads against the fast-moving blaze that grew to several thousand acres in a matter of hours, Dowd said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times) Dowd said he expects containment to grow over Friday night as firefighters double down on the work that’s been done so far — “so that’s patrolling, mopping up, reinforcing containment lines, addressing hot spots and flareups as they occur, and continuing to provide structure defense and structure protection to those properties that may be at risk.” Residents in the Val Verde area said flames were visible from the neighborhood’s western edge Thursday, but the threat appeared to have calmed a bit by Friday morning, though the air remained thick with soot and ash. This is a pretty big threat to the community.” The Canyon fire quickly became one of the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. Temperatures were forecast to peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, and that heat plus the winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend, said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,” the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast.

While Jason Hong was celebrating his 75th birthday, he suddenly found himself thinking about his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk, a white and red single-engine beauty with colorful stripes that he calls his “old treasure.” He doesn’t fly it much anymore, but given the occasion he resolved to visit his plane as soon as he could to “say hi,” like a lifelong friend you see around holidays and special occasions. As Hong would come to find out, the colorful aircraft had been flown across Southern California by an unknown pilot, unnoticed, in a series of joyrides — or joy flights — at least twice before and then simply returned to the airport. After finding his plane a second time, Hong said he’s tried to put details of the thefts together, but the more he learns the more he grows confused about the circumstances. Hong looked up his plane on Flight Aware, a site that tracks flights and aircraft, and found that on his 75th birthday, someone took off with his plane from La Verne airport at 9:54 p.m., for a 51-minute flight that at one point neared Palm Springs. A few hours later, on July 26, the colorfully striped plane was in the air once again, this time for a brief 22-minute flight from Riverside County toward La Verne that started at about 1:30 a.m. The replacement of the battery, Hong said, also suggests its someone familiar with not just flying, but the mechanics of the plane as they seemed to have the tools and know-how about the type of battery needed, and how to install it.

Article: Myra Villarreal wipes tears as her son Adrian Martinez, 20, describes how he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. Advertisement Civil rights activists, city leaders, immigrants and their advocates were hopeful that the indiscriminate sweeps targeting Latinos were over in July after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that Border Patrol agents’ profiling tactics violated the 4th Amendment. Mayor Karen Bass said it appears as if the Wednesday raid at a Home Depot in Westlake — dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” — violated the order, but city attorneys are still trying to determine the facts. Advertisement Now other parts of the country are watching the events in California, expecting federal agents to target their immigrant communities, particularly in states with no judicial orders blocking them. “We’re just waiting for the shoe to drop.” The Times reviewed dozens of witness and surveillance videos, pored through criminal complaints and interviewed lawyers, advocates, bystanders and experts to understand how on-the-ground operations have unfolded this summer and where the points of contention are. Border Patrol agents were driving down West Olympic Boulevard in Montebello — a largely Latino community — when surveillance footage captured their white SUV make a U-turn and pull into the driveway of a tow yard at 4:32 p.m on June 12. As Homeland Security Investigations special agent Nicholas DeSimone later wrote in a federal criminal complaint, the operation was not preplanned but rather part of a “roving patrol”— a controversial tactic that lawsuits link to racial profiling and was widely used in the Los Angeles area after the raids started in June. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong that plaintiffs had documented an “overwhelming record” showing the government “has a policy and practice of conducting so called roving patrols throughout this district to stop individuals without ever making a particularized, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion that the person is in the United States in violation of U.S. Past lawsuits show that Border Patrol agents determined on the fly who to stop, based on the slightest behaviors, from people slowing abruptly, speeding up, avoiding eye contact or not sitting upright. On June 17, Vivaldo Montes Herrera was pushing a trash can across the parking lot of the plaza he’s cleaned for years when he spotted a marked Border Patrol truck, out on a roving patrol, coming straight toward him. As Border Patrol captioned an Instagram video last month: “When they run, we chase.” Across the country, people now wrestle with the question of what do when confronted by immigration agents: Do I run? In her ruling, Judge Frimpong did not order the agents to stop the practice but expressed misgivings about it, noting that the government hadn’t explained “why fleeing upon seeing unidentified masked men with guns exiting from tinted cars without license plates raises suspicion.” Adrian Martinez, 20, with his mom Myra Villarreal, left, describes how his neck was bruised and his leg was injured after he was thrown on the ground by Border Patrol as he was returning from a break as a Walmart employee and trying to protect a co-worker. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) In El Monte, when Montes Herrera was being detained, Adrian Martinez, a worker at a Walmart in the plaza, tried to intervene and was arrested alongside him. Martinez said he heard agents laughing at Montes Herrera and calling him “dumb for running.” Advertisement “We wouldn’t have chased him if he wouldn’t have ran,” Martinez recalled the agents saying. Immigration agents said arrests in June and July often stemmed from “consensual encounters.” Advertisement “The individuals were free to walk away and terminate the encounter, decline to answer questions and refuse to provide requested identification documents,” Kyle Harvick, who heads patrol for the El Centro Sector, said in a court declaration defending the practice used across the Southern California raids. “While some of the individuals encountered freely answered questions about their names and place of birth and provided identification documents, others refused to answer questions and/or walked away from the encounters without any further interaction.” Civil rights and immigration lawyers say that armed, masked men forcefully barking questions to vendors or people in a Home Depot parking lot is anything but a consensual interaction. “If they are showing up in places with that display of force and authority and surrounding the people they’re trying to talk to, that’s no longer a consensual encounter,” said Eva Bitran, a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California. In his declaration, Harvick said certain businesses, including car washes, “have been selected for encounters because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations.” Advertisement At least 58 car washes have been hit, some of them more than once, according to the Clean Carwash Worker Center, which has been tracking the raids. During a hearing last month, Frimpong called some of the locations that agents had hit “general” and “not necessarily associated with not having status.” “As they said, bus stop, car wash, tow yard — maybe they’re correlated with people who are low-income or have low income-occupations, maybe they’re correlated with race or ethnicity, but they don’t seem to be correlated with status,” Frimpong said.

He spoke in “a sort of Eastern European accent,” Starr testified, but lapsed at times into “other unidentified accents.” As they waited for her husband to return, the masked man rambled about himself. “He said he had a number of tools to get us to cooperate,” Starr testified, “but worst case-scenario, he’d leave us zip tied in the closet and burn the house down.” When the suspect brought them snacks — bananas, beef jerky and sparkling water — Starr felt the ordeal had veered into the absurd. “It just seemed so incongruous to zip tie someone in their closet,” she said, “and then bring them a bottle of Perrier.” Advertisement Left in the darkened closet, Starr testified she heard the whir of an electric drill as the intruder boarded up the doors with sheets of plywood.

Article: “Clean Air Vehicle Decals are a smart, cost-effective incentive that has played an important role driving the adoption of clean and zero-emission vehicles in California,” read a statement from Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. Extending the decal program in California — or any other state — would require the approval of Congress and the signature of President Trump, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. “It seems that the only deadline that this Congress responds to are the deadlines that are set by Trump, and I really don’t see him going out of his way to extend this program.” Advertisement Why this state program needs congressional approval Federal legislation has allowed the U.S. Advertisement “Clearly in the early days of zero-emission cars, the carpool lane stickers were an important incentive for some drivers, particularly in places like the Bay Area and Los Angeles where there is major congestion,” Magavern said. “Just like a lot of other incentives, the HOV lane access through the Clean Air Vehicle Program is one of those things that drivers look to to assess the overall package of what it’s like to either go electric or to get that next electric vehicle,” said Alexia Martineau, senior policy manager for Plug In America. What’s being done to extend the life of clean air vehicle decals In an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. “Putting the brakes on this program means that starting October 1, 2025, CAV decals will no longer be valid in California, or elsewhere in the United States,” the Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement. “All vehicles will be required to meet posted vehicle occupancy to travel in carpool lanes and pay required tolls or risk receiving a citation.” According to the California Air Resources Board, there are 519,000 active decals in the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “Now that California has hundreds of thousands of zero-emission vehicles, they can take up a lot of space in the HOV lanes, and those were meant to incentivize people to carpool,” he said. In fact, sales on electric vehicles have been on the rise in the state since 2011, with the exception of stagnant sales between 2018 and 2020, according to a report published by UC Davis. The university’s Electric Vehicle Research Center conducted a survey of drivers from the start of the year until June and found that almost 30% of people said that without any state incentives, including the decal, they wouldn’t have chosen to purchase an electric vehicle, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the center. “Only 8% of the vehicles on the road are electric, and that’s not enough for you to reach the point where the vehicles are a social norm.” The Clean Air Vehicle Decal program is just one way the state is working toward its environmental goals — milestones that have recently come under attack, including California’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards. House voted to prohibit California from banning the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035 and end the state’s ability to set emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and to combat smog levels.

Article: Gavin Newsom on Thursday said UC should not bend “on their knees” to the president as university leaders negotiate with the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in frozen UCLA grants amid antisemitism accusations. Columbia will pay more than $200 million to the federal government and Brown will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce programs — in addition to promises to share admissions data with federal authorities. The remarks from Newsom were his first public comments about how UC should proceed with Trump, and the first indication — if vague — of how a UC settlement with Trump may or may not look. Advertisement The university system, run by its president and Board of Regents, is independent under the state Constitution of “all political or sectarian influence.” At at the same time, the governor can exercise political sway over the regents, whose members he appoints. Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, made the remarks during a media question-and-answer period after an event about artificial intelligence workforce partnerships the state announced with Google, Adobe, IBM and Microsoft. Advertisement Asked about UC’s negotiations, Newsom said, “They’ll do the right thing.” “I have the confidence and I’ll do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.” UC and UCLA spokespeople did not immediately respond Thursday to a question about Newsom’s comments. Milliken said Wednesday that the university system was “agreeing to engage in dialogue with the federal administration” after the Department of Justice sent a letter to UC last week saying it found UCLA had violated the civil rights of Jewish students after activists erected a pro-Palestinian encampment in April 2024. Milliken said the the goal of negotiations was for all “suspended and at-risk federal funding restored to the university as soon as possible.” The grant suspensions affect research into areas including neuroscience, clean energy and cancer. Pam Bondi said on July 28 that UCLA would pay a “heavy price” for acting with “deliberate indifference” to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students who complained of antisemitic incidents since Oct. It is in our country’s best interest that funding be restored.” Advertisement In a campuswide letter Wednesday, UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk said the grant suspensions were “devastating for UCLA and for Americans across the nation.” Times staff writer Taryn Luna contributed to this report.

Article: Fire season in California is indeed starting earlier and lasting longer in virtually every region of California than it did two decades ago, researchers have found, thanks largely to human-caused climate change. And in the Cascade Range, which runs into Oregon, fire season now begins 46 days earlier than it once did, according to a study published this week in the journal Science Advances. Advertisement “Anecdotally, those of us living here have this sense that it’s been happening sooner,” said Amanda Fencl, a Berkeley-based water specialist who directs climate science for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists and was not directly involved with the research. “This is really an important study to quantify just how soon and where it is shifting, and to what extent.” Newsletter Toward a more sustainable California Get Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation — and the solution. Although the number of people living in California has grown by roughly 27% since the early 1990s, human-ignited fires have dropped significantly during that time, enabling the researchers to rule out human-caused blazes as the source of the additional burn days. Advertisement “It’s often said we no longer [have] a wildfire season, but that wildfire season is all year, and that’s tied to warming temperatures,” said James Thorne, a UC Davis landscape ecologist who was not involved with the research. More than 220,000 acres have burned in the state as of mid-July, almost 100,000 acres more than California has seen on average at this point in the year over the last five years, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . That total does not include the 96,000 acres burned in the Gifford fire , which was 15% contained as of Thursday, nor three different fires that started Monday in Southern California that together have burned more than 2,800 acres and are not yet contained. In 2018, the year the Camp fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed more people than any wildfire in California history, wildfire damages statewide were an estimated $148.5 billion .

Article: The “Solar for All” program was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribal groups, regions and nonprofits under the Biden administration’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27-billion program geared toward addressing climate change. “One of the more shocking features of Solar For All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through with all of the middlemen taking their own cut — at least 15% by conservative estimates,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ EPA is taking action to end this program for good,” Zeldin added, referring to President Trump’s tax and spending bill he recently signed into law. This week, Los Angeles celebrated the opening of one of the nation’s largest solar and battery power plants, the Eland facility in Kern County, which is now supplying 7% of the city’s power. The California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency were going to oversee and distribute the grant funds, which were particularly focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities and California tribes. Advertisement In a joint statement, the three agencies said the EPA’s termination of Solar for All funding “needlessly increases the cost of community solar and storage projects in California and damages California’s efforts to unleash innovation, train people for today’s energy jobs, and build clean energy projects.” Two nonprofits — the Community Power Coalition and GRID Alternatives — each had $250-million awards for separate efforts to develop community solar and multifamily solar projects across several states, including in California. Climate & Environment California Supreme Court sides with environmental groups in rooftop solar case The California Supreme Court sided with environmental groups in a Thursday ruling, saying that state lawyers were wrong in their claim that the Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives could not be challenged. Estimates were that the program would have saved low-income households $400 a year on electricity bills, created more than 200,000 jobs and eliminated more than 30 million metric tons of air pollution, according to the nonprofit Climate Power. “The Trump administration isn’t just walking away from climate solutions — they’re ripping affordable energy away from the families who need it most.” Trump — who received record donations from fossil fuel companies during his 2024 presidential campaign — is making a number of efforts to slow the transition to clean energy while encouraging the use of fossil fuels, including canceling credits for solar and wind projects by the end of 2027. Advertisement “This latest heist from the Trump administration will cause energy costs to rise, keep Americans beholden to monopolistic electric utilities, and make our grid overburdened and less reliable,” Markey said in a statement. “Trump and Zeldin’s attacks on the Solar for All program and their attempts to cancel legally-binding contracts will mean energy bills are going to continue to spike nationwide.” The program would have created more than $8 billion in overall savings across all 50 states, Markey said. “Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate,” the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency said in their joint statement. “Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects.” The Environmental Protection Network, composed of more than 600 former EPA employees, described the decision as an “abrupt and arbitrary” betrayal of public health, environmental justice and economic opportunity. “Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”

Article: The Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on “roving patrols” implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment. The restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. Advertisement The Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong’s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” Lawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration’s arguments. “The brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.” Advertisement The move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck — actions some experts said appeared to violate the court’s order. “I think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.” Advertisement The Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes “manifest irreparable harm” to the government. President Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives. District and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of “Alligator Alcatraz.” But little of the president’s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.

Article: Caught in the middle are a handful of California Republicans, from relative newcomers to seasoned veterans, who represent pockets of the state from the U.S.-Mexico border to the remote forests in the northeast corner. That’s shocking.” The California gerrymandering plan taking shape behind closed doors would increase the Democratic Party’s dominance in the Golden State, adding as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats, according to a draft map reviewed by The Times. That’s what separates what we’re doing from what others are doing.” The proposed boundaries of the new congressional districts continue to shift, but the goal for California Democrats remains the same: Funnel the state’s Republican voters into fewer seats, boost vulnerable Democrats and turn some GOP-dominant districts into narrowly divided toss-ups. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) Kiley represents a sprawling district that runs along the Nevada border from Northern California to Death Valley, cutting through Mammoth and Lake Tahoe and the cities of Roseville, Rocklin and Folsom. He said the bill would “stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.” Newsom, Kiley said, is “trying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California.” Rep. LaMalfa said in an interview that he had seen one map that shifted his district south to include parts of Sonoma County wine country and shifted some conservative rural areas in the north in another lawmaker’s district. “I hope the weight of how bad this looks collapses on them before we even have to go through these gyrations, and millions and millions of dollars.” He said he was certain that Republicans would litigate the new map if Democrats push ahead. “If they throw me in some wine country district or some coastal district, and that throws me out, then I can go over here and finish cutting apart this tree that fell on my fence last night.” Rep. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster. Valadao represents the California district with the highest percentage of Medicaid recipients, many of whom may lose coverage because of legislation approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump. Calvert said he strongly opposes “the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians” to replace maps drawn by the redistricting commission “with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies.” Deviating from the independent redistricting process “disenfranchises voters and degrades trust in our political system,” Kim said in a statement. She said Newsom should, “for once, focus on addressing the pressing issues making life harder for Californians under his watch instead of trying to position himself for a presidential run.” Newsom this week said he was pleased to see Republican members coming out in support of independent redistricting. A spokesman for Issa declined to comment but referred to a statement from the state’s nine-member Republican delegation, which said that Trump won 38% of the presidential vote in California last year, but Republicans hold fewer than 1 in 5 of the state’s 52 House seats. Newsom, the delegation said, is trying to wrest power from the independent redistricting commission and “place it back into the hands of Sacramento politicians to further his left-wing political agenda.” “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want,” the statement said.

Article: Stanford University’s student newspaper is suing the Trump administration, claiming the threat to deport foreign students for speaking out against Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza is chilling free speech. Some Stanford Daily writers, who are foreigners in the country on student visas, have even turned down assignments to write about unrest in the Middle East because they’re afraid they’ll be deported. The suit accuses Trump administration officials, specifically Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, of placing their statutory authority to deport a foreign visa holder whose beliefs they deem un-American ahead of the constitutional right — guaranteed by the 1st Amendment— to free speech. “When a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights,” the newspaper’s lawyers wrote, “the Constitution prevails.” Advertisement Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, scoffed at the lawsuit, calling it “baseless.” “There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here,” she said in a statement. The lawsuit — which was filed by the 133-year-old student newspaper, not by the university itself — is the most recent salvo in an increasingly bitter fight between Trump and many of the nation’s elite universities. Advertisement His weapon of choice is to threaten to withhold billions of dollars in federal research grants from institutions that refuse to adopt policies on issues such as diversity, transgender rights and Israel that fall in line with his Make America Great Again ideology. Critics call Trump’s campaign an attack on academic freedom, but fearing massive budget cuts, several Ivy League schools — including the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and Brown — have recently cut deals with the Trump administration in an attempt to limit the damage. The Stanford Daily’s lawsuit focuses on two unnamed students, John and Jane Doe, who the paper’s lawyers say began self-censoring out of a well-founded fear of having their visas revoked and being deported. Rubio has claimed that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows the secretary of State to revoke a noncitizen’s legal status if it is decided the person’s actions or statements “compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” Rubio used that interpretation to justify the March arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. Referencing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — which includes Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip — the slogan is viewed as a call for freedom and self-determination by Palestinians. As a result, Doe’s profile appeared on the Canary Mission, a pro-Israel website that creators say is devoted to outing “hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews.” Department of Homeland Security officials have acknowledged they consult the website’s profiles — most of which are of students and faculty at elite universities — for information on people worthy of investigation. As a result, since March, Jane Doe has deleted her social media accounts and has “refrained from publishing and voicing her true opinions regarding Palestine and Israel,” the lawsuit claims. John Doe has participated in pro-Palestine demonstrations, has accused Israel of genocide and chanted, “From the river to the sea.” But after the Trump administration started targeting campus demonstrators for deportation, he “refrained from publishing a study containing criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza,” according to the lawsuit.

Article: A rapidly growing wildfire straddling the Ventura-Los Angeles county line Thursday afternoon triggered evacuations in and around Piru and Castaic amid a major heat wave that officials warned could foster extreme fire growth and behavior. Advertisement “Fire conditions are settling down for the night, the air is cooling off, and we continue to have an aggressive fire attack happening, coordinated between ground resources and helicopters,” said Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd. “So while we certainly have a significant number of people still evacuated and a significant number of residents that are under evacuation orders, we continue to make good progress.” That progress led to an evacuation order in a section of Val Verde being downgraded to an evacuation warning Thursday night, he said. As midnight approached, 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd. “In the area of the fire that’s in Ventura County, we do have four evacuation zones, but it’s a very sparsely populated area, very rural area, and the fire is moving east out of that area,” he said. Both the Ventura and Los Angeles counties’ fire departments were responding to the scene, where crews were facing temperatures up to 100 degrees with wind gusts up to 25 mph, according to the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles office. “Our firefighters are working tirelessly in the heat and steep terrain to make that happen.” In Ventura County, evacuation orders were issued for the Lake Piru Recreation Area as well as the communities of Camulos and Piru. (KTLA-TV) Advertisement Fixed-wing firefighter airplanes were grounded shortly around sunset per aviation regulations, but firefighting helicopters will remain at the scene overnight working with ground crews to try to get a handle on the blaze, Dowd said. “We have a quick [water drop] turnaround time because of our proximity to Lake Piru.” Dowd said he was cautiously optimistic that crews would make strong progress on the fire overnight as winds and temperatures died down. “There are light winds that are pushing the fire eastward, but we’re not seeing a significant wind-driven fire like we saw with Palisades or the Eaton fire or the Mountain fire in Ventura County,” he said. “Those were wind-driven fires with long-range spotting that was occurring, and this is much more of a fuel- and terrain- and temperature-driven fire.” California Canyon fire: Evacuation zones, road closures, shelters The Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castaic near the Los Angeles-Ventura county line. “It’s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn’t reach them.” The L.A. “Similar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter in place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,” agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement.

The federal reports, prepared by hundreds of volunteer scientists, are subject to extensive peer review and detail how climate change is affecting each region of the United States so far and provide the latest scientific forecasts. Advertisement Wright accused the previous reports of being politically biased, stating that they “are not fair assessments of the data.” “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said. His statements came after the Trump administration in April dismissed more than 400 experts who had already started work on the sixth National Climate Assessment, due for publication in late 2027 or early 2028. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in March proclaimed the administration was “driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” In his CNN appearance, Wright said the previous climate change assessments — including the 2018 report prepared during Trump’s first term — were not “a reasonable representation of broad climate science.” Advertisement “They have been more politically driven to hype up a real issue, but an issue that’s just nowhere near the world’s greatest challenge,” he said of climate change. “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears — that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was among the authors dismissed by the administration. “This is one more alarming example of the Trump administration’s ongoing and highly politicized effort to obfuscate scientific truth to further its dangerous and deadly pro-fossil fuel agenda,” Cleetus said. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, noted in a post on X that the previous National Climate Assessments were authored by hundreds of scientists who were leading domain experts in their fields. Advertisement “This would mark an extraordinary, unprecedented, and alarming level of interference in what has historically been a fair and systematic process,” Swain said of the possibility that previous reports could be altered.

Article: The California Supreme Court sided with environmental groups in a Thursday ruling, saying that state lawyers were wrong in their claim that the Public Utilities Commission’s decision to slash rooftop solar incentives could not be challenged. The groups argue the utilities commission violated state law in 2022 when it cut the value of the credits that panel owners receive for sending their unused power to the electric grid by as much as 80%. The environmental groups argued the appeals court ignored a 1998 law that said the commission’s decisions should be held to the same standard of court review as those by other state agencies. Advertisement “The California Supreme Court has ruled in our favor that the CPUC is not above the law,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president at the Environmental Working Group, after Thursday’s decision was published. “We are pleased that the CPUC’s decision will remain in effect as an important part of controlling electricity bills.” Matt Freedman, a lawyer at The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, said the state Supreme Court ruling could lead to more lawsuits against the commission.

Article: Lorena Gonzalez, executive director of the California Federation of Labor, speaks at a 2024 rally in Encino, where Hollywood union members had gathered to kick off their contract negotiations with the major studios. One of California’s most influential labor organizations endorsed redrawing the state’s congressional maps to counter President Trump’s effort to push Republican states, notably Texas, to increase his party’s numbers in Congress in next year’s midterm election. Gavin Newsom and many of the state’s Democratic leaders, would ask voters to temporarily change congressional district boundaries that were drawn by an independent redistricting commission four years ago, with some conditions. “California Labor is unified in our resolve to fight back against President Trump’s anti-worker agenda.” Redistricting — the esoteric redrawing of the nation’s 435 congressional districts — typically occurs once every decade after the U.S. Population shifts can result in changes in a state’s allocation of congressional seats, such as when California lost a seat after the 2020 census the first time in the state’s history. Advertisement The ballot measure being pushed by Newsom and others would allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles if Texas approves a pending measure to reconfigure districts to increase Republican-held congressional seats in that state. The California Federation of Labor is committed to spending several million dollars supporting a mid-decade redistricting ballot measure, on top of what it already planned to spend on competitive congressional races next year, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the strategy. A spokesperson for several organizations devoted to fighting any effort to change the state’s redistricting process said that Charles Munger Jr., the son of a billionaire, and who bankrolled the ballot measure to create the independent commission, is committed to making sure it is not weakened. Advertisement “While Charles Munger has been out of politics since 2016, he has said he will vigorously defend the reforms he helped pass, including nonpartisan redistricting,” said Amy Thoma, spokesperson for the Voters First Coalition.

Article: Last week, the Department of Insurance ordered the state’s home insurer of last resort to answer allegations that it has handled smoke damage claims illegally, which has prompted policyholder complaints and multiple lawsuits. Advertisement “I’ve spoken with wildfire survivors who would rather lose their homes to flames than endure the stress and confusion of navigating smoke damage claims,” Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. “This is unacceptable.” Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan, said in a statement that the insurer “welcomes the opportunity to engage in this process” and has been working with the department over the past year to “update and clarify its policy language around smoke damage.” Business In landmark decision, judge rules California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy is illegal A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has ruled that the California FAIR Plan’s smoke-damage policy, which limits claims payments by the insurer of last resort, is a violation of state insurance law. The FAIR Plan’s handling of smoke damage claims has angered homeowners who say that instead of being promptly offered industrial hygienic testing for toxic substances and professional cleaning services — even after homes were infiltrated by soot, ash and other fire debris — they were told to try to clean up their properties and given lowball offers to close their claims. Advertisement However, advocates for policyholders have questioned why it took so long for the department to take the action after its own probe in 2022 found 418 violations of state law and the insurance code. Eaton and Palisades fire survivors suffered needlessly under FAIR Plan smoke damage denials because Lara failed to act on the findings of his own investigation,” said Joy Chen, chief executive and co-founder of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a community group formed after the Jan. Harvey Rosenfield, an attorney and founder of Los Angeles advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and a critic of Lara who has accused him of being too chummy with the insurance industry, said the commissioner could have sought an injunction in civil court to halt the alleged illegal claim denials years ago. “It raises the question of Lara’s true intentions, though he could prove us all wrong.” The order to show cause filed by the department accuses the FAIR Plan of denying smoke damage claims through its reliance on illegal policy language adopted in 2017 that requires the claims to show “permanent physical changes” to property. Sanchez said the department has taken a number of escalating legal actions against the FAIR Plan, including holding a 2022 investigative hearing and issuing a May 2025 legal directive declaring the “permanent damage” policy language unlawful and unenforceable. The department’s action follows a landmark pretrial ruling in June by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge that found the language to be illegal in a 2021 case involving a former Mono County homeowner. Since that ruling, however, the plan has continued to reject smoke damage claims based on the 2017 policy language, contending that the decision did not set a precedent, said Dylan Schaffer, an attorney who handled the case. “It remains to be seen whether the department’s action that should have been taken in 2022 will do anything to help consumers, including those impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires,” he added. Amy Bach, an attorney and executive director of United Policyholders, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it is important that the department work with Schaffer and other attorneys who have already filed lawsuits against the plan.

Article: In his efforts to look like a “fighter” ahead of a potential run for the presidency in 2028, he’s willing to ignore democratic rules in pursuit of political aims, setting aside the state’s independent redistricting system to counter Texas Republicans’ proposed partisan gerrymander. In 2008 and 2010, California voters passed ballot initiatives that gave the power to draw the state’s legislative and congressional district lines to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a 14-person independent body composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people who are registered with neither of the two major parties. Potential commissioners go through an extensive vetting and selection process (which the state Legislature participates in) and are prohibited from many forms of political activism, including donating to candidates, running for office or working for elected officials. Since the latest redistricting, in 2021 — triggered as usual by the constitutionally mandated decennial census — the map crafted by the commission has survived legal and political challenges, and the current districts are set to be in place through the next round of redistricting in 2031. Now Newsom wants to prematurely redraw the lines and craft his own partisan gerrymander for the November 2026 midterm elections, wresting control of the process away from the commission and giving it instead to the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. Last week, Newsom confirmed that he will call a special election to get voter approval for this end-run around the commission, but even dressed up with a vote, this is cynical politics, not democracy, at work. Greg Abbott and President Trump are backing to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress from that state, and in turn, to enhance the party’s chances to retain control of the U.S. California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) calls the Texas action a “Trumpian power grab,” and Newsom assails it as the “rigging of the system by the president of the United States.” (Recent public opinion research conducted by Newsom’s pollster revealed that the public is more likely to support a California redistricting maneuver if the fight has Trump, not Texas, as the central villain.) But two wrongs don’t make a right. A key difference between the proposed line redrawing in Texas and the California plan is that the former, however brazen, is legal and precedented, while the latter specifically contravenes California law and the expressed will of the state’s voters. To add insult to injury, the cost of the special election to ratify the scheme is estimated to be about $60 million in Los Angeles County alone, with statewide costs likely exceeding $200 million.

Article: When a federal court appointed a receiver to take over a Mississippi jail plagued by inmate deaths three years ago, the Hinds County supervisors decried the move as “utterly unaccountable” to voters. Advertisement “I’m looking at it as help — much needed help,” said Supervisor Janice Hahn, whose district includes Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, which has been the site of a riot, escape attempts and multiple overdoses since it reopened in 2023. Advertisement Last month, Bonta said the county’s “repeated, constant and chronic” failure to adhere to the settlement left him with no choice but to ask the court to approve a receiver for the county’s two remaining halls. “I don’t believe a receivership approach will be successful without changes to the staff and the employment agreement that governs how these halls operate.” Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey has been the site of a riot, escape attempts and multiple overdoses since it reopened in 2023. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) On July 29, the three unions representing probation employees sent a letter to Horvath accusing her of “reckless, union-busting rhetoric” and ignoring state law that protects members’ collective bargaining rights. “If the Court appoints the Receiver, we will hold him accountable to state law and to the terms of our contract.” Absent some sweeping new power, Probation Chief Guillermo Viera Rosa warns, the receiver will run into the same obstacles as every other chief. “Simply having a receiver saying do X, Y and Z isn’t going to change anything unless they have explicit powers that I haven’t had or that the county hasn’t been able to implement because of, for example, the civil service or unions,” Viera Rosa said. “If it’s simply additional oversight and putting another person to simply have a separate budget, but no new ideas or powers, then it’s a critical mistake.” Advertisement And potentially a costly one. County Chief Executive Fesia Davenport warned her bosses at a meeting last week that handing financial control to a receiver could have “significant impacts” to the county’s finances, which already have been wrecked with federal cuts , a $4-billion sex abuse settlement and costly labor negotiations . “If a receiver can cut through the red tape that has stalled past reform efforts, then it’s a step worth taking.” Soon after taking the job in 2023, Viera Rosa diagnosed his ailing department with a “call out culture.” Employees scheduled to work often didn’t show up for their shifts. “You’re going to have to give the receiver the authority to suspend contracts — whether it’s employment contracts, union contracts, broad authority to suspend civil service rules — just a tremendous amount of authority to really move the needle on this.” Advertisement That’s what happened in Cook County, the only juvenile detention facility in America to go into a receivership. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Bonta’s office said in a statement the receiver will have the power to hire and fire staffers and “all other necessary decisions for compliance.” “If the receivership is approved, the receiver would have the power to negotiate or renegotiate contracts and to petition the court to waive a contractual obligation in certain circumstances,” the his office said in a statement. “Even in a federal receivership, they’ve sort of left the contracts alone,” said Don Specter, a senior staff attorney with the Prison Law Office, whose Supreme Court case focused on inadequate medical care for California prisoners led to a receiver.

Article: A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who shot a man in the back in 2021 will not face criminal charges, according to records made public by the district attorney’s office late last month. Los Angeles County prosecutors found there was “insufficient evidence” to prove Deputy Yen Liu was not acting in lawful self-defense when he shot Adrian Abelar at a Rosemead auto body shop four years ago, firing a round that fractured several vertebrae and nearly paralyzed him, according to court records and Abelar’s attorney. Deputies were responding to reports that Abelar — a convicted felon who could not legally possess a firearm — had threatened to shoot several people at the auto body shop. In video from the incident, deputies can be heard shouting, “Gun!” right before Liu closes in on Abelar, whose right arm is clearly outstretched and empty at the time Liu opens fire. Advertisement “Since one reasonable interpretation of the evidence leads to the conclusion that Liu acted in response to an apparent danger, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Liu did not act in self-defense when he shot Abelar in the back,” prosecutors wrote in a 10-page declination memo made public in late July. There were only four other cases since 2013 in which more than two years elapsed between a deputy-involved shooting and a charging decision being made by prosecutors, according to a 2021 report by the L.A. He claimed the investigation was “purposefully stalled for more than two years.” Advertisement Liu has returned to active duty and is assigned to the Temple Station, where he worked when the shooting occurred, according to Nicole Nishida, a sheriff’s department spokeswoman. “The guy clearly does not have a weapon in his hand and the deputy who is on top of him draws his firearm, jams it in the guy’s back and fires it immediately upon contact,” said Ed Obayashi, a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff’s deputy who advises police departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents. According to recordings made public by law enforcement, Doktor said Abelar arrived at his shop that day demanding car repairs because he was fleeing from the cops due to an active murder warrant. While living on the street, Abelar was arrested last May on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, resisting arrest and having a forged driver’s license, records show.

Article: Gavin Newsom calls the “labyrinth of manual verification,” which involves Medi-Cal recipients proving every six months that they are working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours per month. It’s relatively uncharted territory, and it’s not yet clear how the rules will shake out for the 5.1 million people in California who will be required to prove that they are working in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid. Advertisement After the 2026 midterm elections, millions of healthy adults will be required to prove every six months that they meet the work requirement in order to qualify for Medicaid. The rule applies to those whose income is between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty limit, a group that became eligible for Medicaid when the program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. But those programs were brief, overturned by the courts and weren’t “a coordinated effort among the states to figure out what the best practices are,” said Ryan Long, the director of congressional relations at the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that has become influential among congressional Republicans. Arguments from liberal groups that people will lose healthcare are a “straw man argument,” Long said: “They know that the public supports work requirements for these benefits, so they can’t come out and say, ‘We don’t support them.’” A poll by the health research group KFF found this year that 62% of American adults support tying Medicaid eligibility to work requirements. The poll also found that support for the policy drops to less than 1 in 3 people when respondents hear “that most people on Medicaid are already working and many would risk losing coverage because of the burden of proving eligibility through paperwork.” In June, Newsom warned that some Californians could be forced to fill out 36 pages of paperwork to keep their insurance, showing reporters an image of a stack of forms with teal and gold accents that he described as “an actual PDF example of the paperwork that people will have to submit to for their eligibility checks.” Many Californians already are required to fill out that 36-page form or its online equivalent to enroll in Medi-Cal and Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace. Two years ago, the state made healthcare available to people who were working at least 80 hours per month and earned less than the federal poverty limit (about $15,000 for one person or $31,200 for a household of four). The Medicaid program has cost more than $100 million so far, and of that, $26 million was spent on health benefits and more than $20 million was allocated to marketing contracts, KFF Health News reported. Advertisement The Inland Empire agency that provides Medi-Cal coverage for about 1.5 million people in San Bernardino and Riverside counties estimated that 150,000 members could lose their insurance as a result of work requirements. Jarrod McNaughton, the chief executive of the Inland Empire Health Plan, said that California’s 58 counties, which administer Medi-Cal, “will be the ones at the precipice of piecing this together” but haven’t yet received guidance on how the eligibility process will be set up or what information people will have to provide.

Article: Arrests of undocumented immigrants have dropped significantly across the Los Angeles region two months after the Trump administration launched its aggressive mass deportation operation, according to new figures released Wednesday by Homeland Security. “Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. White House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around “sanctuary” jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. “If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote, “they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.” It’s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: “From the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.”

Per the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s claims could serve as the catalyst for an executive order as early as this week designed to punish the banking industry for allegedly discriminating against conservatives.

While starting a newspaper now may seem like starting a horse-and-buggy company 20 years after the arrival of the automobile, there’s evidence that parent company News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch has done his homework: The Post says it’s been profitable the past three years, a rare feat in the industry. “We are at a pivotal moment for the city and the state, and there is no doubt that The Post will play a crucial role,” said Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp.—DL

Article: Ty Haney, the woman who brought you exercise dresses, has returned to her athleisure company, Outdoor Voices, as a partner and co-owner ahead of today’s launch of the first collection of her new tenure. The original outdoor voice said she started working with OV again late last year, soon after a private equity firm bought the struggling brand and asked Haney to come home. It’s a full-circle moment on an overall bumpy ride for OV: The DTC brand peaked in 2018, five years after its founding, with legions of millennial fans and a $110 million valuation. OV reported its first profitable month soon after for June 2020, but the overhaul didn’t last—OV shuttered all of its stores last year before accepting an acquisition offer to avoid bankruptcy.

Article: Like a straight-A student living the nightmare that their teacher called their parents to say they’re on the verge of failing math, famously conflict-avoidant Switzerland is racing against the clock to get out of the fight President Trump picked with the country last week. The trade barrier—which one Swiss newspaper called the country’s biggest defeat since France beat it in the Battle of Marignano in 1515—came after a phone call between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter last week. The country’s leaders are now getting flak for bungling talks and are working to change Trump’s mind before the new tariff rate is slated to kick in on August 7. Switzerland’s claim to fame as a top-shelf goods supplier is what made it a target for some of Trump’s heaviest tariffs: The land of bougie chocolate and watches has the 13th-largest annual trade surplus with the US, amounting to $38 billion last year. Though a chunk of that comes from Swiss gold exports (the country is a major transit point for the precious metal), some local business leaders blamed the country’s pharma giants for inspiring Trump’s ire. Even though pharma is currently exempt from the import duty, Switzerland-based Novartis and Roche’s US subsidiary Genentech were among the major pharma purveyors that POTUS recently gave 60 days to lower drug prices. But Switzerland’s business minister Guy Parmelin said the country could try to win Trump over by offering to buy more American liquefied natural gas or ramping up investments in the US economy.—SK

Another lost job: Hours after the revised data was released, President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing the Biden appointee of manipulating the numbers without providing evidence for that claim. The president called Powell a “stubborn MORON” who should be put “out to pasture,” and said if Powell doesn’t cut rates soon, the Fed’s Board of Governors should assume control of the central bank. And another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, announced Friday that she’s leaving her role at the central bank even though her term is not over, opening the door for Trump to appoint someone more inclined to cut interest rates.—BC

Article: Last night, with a self-imposed midnight deadline looming for the end of the tariff pause, meaning countries that hadn’t reached a new trade deal with the US would get turned into a pumpkin slapped with higher tariffs, President Trump rolled out new tariffs to be imposed on imports from dozens of countries—but pushed off their implementation until Aug. A senior US official told Bloomberg that the rates fell into roughly three groups: 10% for countries where the US has a trade surplus, 15% for those where the US has a small trade deficit, and higher for countries with a large deficit or that didn’t strike deals: For countries that did make deals–including Japan, Britain, the EU, Indonesia, and South Korea—the order appears to reflect the tariffs that were agreed to, even though the details are still being worked out. Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25%, but that this would exclude any goods covered by the trade deal he brokered with Canada and Mexico during his first term. There’s no getting around them: The order imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods deemed “transhipped,” which means made in one country with components from another to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile…a federal appeals court appeared skeptical yesterday of Trump’s legal power to set tariffs without congressional approval while hearing the Justice Department’s appeal of a federal trade court’s May ruling that struck down the tariffs (but was then halted).

Article: The parents in 19 Kids and Counting probably wish they lived in China, where the government will pay families $500 a year per baby until the child turns three, state media reported yesterday. The cash is meant to be a birthing incentive to remedy the country’s ongoing population decline, which threatens to undermine its economy: China’s fertility rate dropped from 2.51 children per woman in 1990 to 1.01 last year, well below the 2.1 rate needed to maintain a stable population. Local governments in China already offer their own baby bucks incentives, with the capital of the Inner Mongolia region offering the most generous subsidy of up to $14,000 per child. The Trump administration has reportedly considered a $5,000 “baby bonus,” and the recently passed Republican tax bill included the government funding a $1,000 investment account for babies born through 2028.

Article: After an hourlong meeting, the pair emerged with what Trump called “the biggest deal ever made.” The European Union’s 27 countries will be charged a baseline tariff of 15% on most exports. Europe wanted a zero-to-zero tariff deal or a 10% rate, like the UK negotiated, but ended up with less than the 20% tariff Trump originally announced in April and the 30% rate he floated on July 12. “It is the best we could get,” von der Leyen said, acknowledging that the negotiations started from “an imbalance,” a reference to the US’ significant trade deficit with the EU. However, von der Leyen said that the 15% rate would not stack on top of industry-specific tariffs already in place, and that the deal provided “stability” and “predictability” for the EU. No written documents were immediately provided with the announcement, and more details will likely be clarified this week, but the biggest takeaways yesterday were: The 50% tariff on steel from Europe remains in place.

The legal standard could make proving Tesla’s liability difficult: As The Verge reported, it’s likely an uphill climb for the plaintiffs, since the court is using Florida’s standard, which is “whether the car manufacturer exhibited a reckless disregard for human life equivalent to manslaughter by designing and marketing the vehicle.” As for other states…few have language on the books to determine who is liable in the case of an autonomous vehicle accident. Bottom line: Should Tesla lose this case, it could hurt the company’s reputation and further damage its already flagging sales, as the company has staked its future on growing its robotaxi fleet.—DL

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — After weeks of protests following a six-alarm fire at The Cooper Apartments, dozens of tenants displaced by that fire have filed a lawsuit against the complex seeking damages. According to a press release from Varghese Summersett, the Texas law firm representing the tenants in the case, some residents have been told they'll never be allowed to access their apartment or belongings, losing irreplaceable possessions and critical documents. This is cruelty piled on top of catastrophe.” In addition to the apartment complex, the apartment owner, the property management, the electrical contractor, the owner of the electrical contractor and the electrician on site that day are all listed as defendants in the suit. “I have to live with that for the rest of my life.” Another plaintiff, Zaire Harris, described the uncertainty and stress of going weeks without basic needs or access to his home. “Fluffy words, very little action.” Attorney Katie Steele, who is representing a growing group of 49 former residents, said her clients were not only displaced but also denied basic tenant rights. "I hope we get to the bottom of what happened and how it got to be so bad." Steele has also reportedly sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction of any portions of the apartment complex in order to preserve evidence. A spokesperson for The Cooper said in a statement to WFAA, "We are reviewing the allegations in the lawsuit and are unable to comment." A resident of The Cooper Apartments, who is among the complainants in the suit, shared a lease termination notice dated July 31, 2025, which said the following: The lease is terminated, effective seven days after the date of the letter Leases terminated Aug. 7 as notice was sent July 31 Tenants cannot access the apartment to retrieve their belongings because the building is structurally unsafe, all personal belongings were destroyed in fire and the units are too toxic Tenants will be refunded pro-rated rent from the date of the fire to the lease termination date as well as all deposits All remaining personal property will be thrown away, citing it as a health and safety hazard According to the Fort Worth Fire Department, the fire was reported around 1:30 p.m.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn't distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba's speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: ATLANTA — A DeKalb County Police officer died confronting a gunman near the Emory Atlanta campus, which is right outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Police Chief Greg Padrick said. This evening, my heart goes out to the family as well as the DeKalb County family.” This unfolded in the 1600 block of Clifton Road near the intersection of CDC Parkway -- right in front of the CDC. "To the men and women who work at the CDC, we know you've had a tough go of it in the past year, and my heart goes out to you as there was uncertainty around your occupation," Dickens said. "We are deeply grateful to Governor Kemp, Georgia residents, and the American people for standing with us during this difficult time."

Article: ATLANTA — The Detroit Lions said safety Morice Norris was in stable condition after he was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions’ preseason game Friday night against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. We would like to thank the Atlanta Falcons organization, the EMS team at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the doctors and staff at Grady for their support.” Lions coach Dan Campbell asked for prayers for the 24-year-old Norris. Norris, the former Fresno State player listed as Detroit's second-team safety, hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back’s midsection, and the defender's head snapped back after making the hit. We may be on 32 different teams but we’ve all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.” When play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. It was the right thing to do for Dan and his crew and his team and everything we had going on right there, I thought that was the right thing. It was a tough deal for those guys, a tough deal for us, a tough deal all across the board.” Allen said the decision to not finish the game was easy to make. “We weren't part of that decision but you could look in anyone’s eyes and see that.” Though the decision to not finish the game seemed dramatic, there were two precedents from preseason games in consecutive weeks in August 2023. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular season game at Cincinnati in January 2023.

Article: DOUBLE OAK, Texas — A request for a special use permit to build a helistop in the quiet town of Double Oak has been officially denied by the town’s Planning and Zoning Commission. The homeowner behind the helistop proposal did not attend the meeting, a decision his representative, Ken Frisby, says was made because the family was not in town and because of personal attacks and accusations of receiving "special treatment." “They are hurt and upset about the comments from people who don’t even know them,” said Frisby of Frisby Enterprises & Fine Homes. "In the middle of a busy DFW metroplex, this is heaven," said resident James Hering, who lives across the street from the applicant and has been there more than 10 years. "This is a situation where you've got the needs of the many clearly outweigh the needs of a few or one." Hering tells WFAA that he and a lot of his neighbors do not oppose the family and their decisions to build or subdivide the land.

Article: City officials faced significant challenges preparing the budget, as Dallas grapples with a lower-than-expected sales tax revenue report, an increase in home appraisal appeals and a voter-approved mandate to hire hundreds of new police officers. In addition, Dallas increased the property tax exemption for seniors aged 65 and older or residents with disabilities for the seventh year in a row, raising it from $153,400 to $175,000. "This budget reflects a reimagining of service delivery, the elimination of duplications, the optimization of operational efficiencies and other measures that maintain responsiveness to the needs of the city." Budget Highlights: Keep Dallas safe by hiring 350 police recruits and retaining seasoned officers to end FY 2025-26 with 3,424 officers, the highest number since 2016. Working to provide market-based pay and step pay increases in accordance with the Meet and Confer Agreement for uniform employees, which expires in September, negotiations are underway for the new agreement. Continue with proven strategies to end street homelessness incrementally across the city, including accelerated diversion and rehousing from shelters, to prevent street sleeping with a $10 million investment to move more people inside and prevent overflow into our streets.

Article: 15 over claims that it has become "the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. Asana Partners, a real estate investment firm that owns several properties in the neighborhood — including some near the popular but controversial bar Rodeo Dallas — has filed for a temporary restraining order to have Rodeo's doors shut for the second time this week, according to court documents obtained by WFAA. Before the weekend began, Asana Partners filed the restraining order against Rodeo Ranch Texas LLC on Friday, accusing the bar of being “the epicenter of the spike in violence in Deep Ellum.” "The wrongful activities emanating from Rodeo Dallas are egregious -- unfettered violence, drug use, displays of firearms, underage drinking, excessively loud music, massive uncontrollable crowds and murder," Asana Partners said in the original petition for the restraining order. "Deep Ellum as a whole is flourishing, but the ongoing operation of Rodeo Dallas must be immediately retrained to prevent further irreparable harm to [Asana Partners] and the entire Deep Ellum community." On Tuesday, WFAA spoke with nearby business owners and employees, many of whom celebrated the initial closure, calling it a win for the neighborhood. It's worth noting that a situation like this, where neighboring landlords file restraining orders to shutter businesses, is unprecedented for Deep Ellum, let alone a landlord locking out its tenant, which consistently ranks in the top 15 of alcohol sales for all of Dallas, according to the state. A sign was left on the door stating, "You will be missed." Managing Director of Asset Management for Asana Partners, Chris Dalton, provided the following statement on the temporary restraining order: "At today's 3pm hearing in the 44th District Court in Dallas County, Judge Veretta Frazier ruled in favor of the Temporary Restraining Order filed by Asana Partners against Rodeo Dallas. We thank and are encouraged by Judge Veretta Frazier and the 44th District Court for supporting efforts to protect Deep Ellum and the people who visit, work, and live there." Frazier listened to arguments from attorneys for Rodeo and Asana Partners Friday afternoon. "They want to pump as much alcohol into young folks as they can, and there are no concerns whatsoever for the ramifications or for anyone who lives in this community," attorney Ben Riemer said in court on behalf of Asana Partners. Dave Wishnew, an attorney for Rodeo, fought back, saying Asana Partners isn't representing the city or a community -- only business as a whole in the area and that Asana Partners is not aware of what Rodeo is doing to remedy issues with its landlord, Westdale, or the city. The city attorney of Dallas sent Rodeo a warning letter on July 30, listing several code violations that Rodeo had committed, such as operating as a restaurant rather than a bar, lacking a dance-hall license, and running a mechanical bull without a permit. Measures are in place for this weekend, and nobody is inviting crime into this business." Wishnew also stressed that the bar has no control over what people do outside of it and only inside of it, noting that over a dozen crimes the city connected to the establishment in the letter were never committed on the premises.

Article: Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, the only person to guide the nation’s top law-enforcement agency and its primary intelligence-gathering organization. By the time he came to Washington, at age 53, Webster had practiced law for nearly 20 years, had served a stint as a federal prosecutor and had spent almost nine years on the federal bench in his native St. “Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,” Webster said after he agreed to lead the spy agency. Bush said in a statement Friday night that Webster's “passion for the rule of law and for the greatness of America made him a model public servant.” President Jimmy Carter selected Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as FBI chief as the bureau sought to improve an image tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power. In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission selected Webster, on a partisan vote, to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in the wake of scandals involving Enron and other corporations. “I think of myself as operating from a position of restraint but being ready to take any judicial actions necessary to achieve the ends of justice,” Webster said as he closed his judicial career to join the FBI. The agency was accused, some claimed unfairly, of not anticipating how quickly the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc would crumble and not doing more in advance of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Over a nine-year period that included Webster’s term, CIA officer Aldrich Ames sold secrets to the Soviet Union and compromised dozens of operations before he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1994. Webster, a Christian Scientist who did not smoke, seldom drank and enjoyed playing tennis and reading history, married Drusilla Lane Webster in 1950; they raised two daughters and one son.

Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles (tens of kilometers) across, but Hubble’s observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers).

Article: — A man suspected in a shooting at a Montana bar that left four people dead was captured Friday just a few miles from where the shooting happened after hundreds of law enforcement officers spent the past week scouring nearby mountainsides, authorities said. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during a news conference that about 130 law enforcement officers made a hard push Thursday after getting tips that helped verify they were looking in the right area. Greg Gianforte first confirmed Brown’s capture on social media Friday afternoon, saying it was the result of what he called a “Herculean effort” from law enforcement officers across the state. The community finally would be able to sleep tonight, Anaconda-Deer Valley County Attorney Morgan Smith said, adding that the case is just the beginning for prosecutors who will be seeking to charge Brown with the killings. Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, said search teams found Brown at a structure near The Ranch Bar and that he looked to be “in pretty good shape, physically.” He was communicative and able to identify himself, Johnson said. Eric Hempstead, who owns The Ranch Bar, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) west of The Owl Bar, described an intense law enforcement presence in the densely wooded area over the last couple of days that involved search dogs and drones. Brown, who lived next door to The Owl Bar in Anaconda, served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005. The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Law Enforcement Department did not respond this week to several email and phone messages requesting records of the welfare checks Boyle said they helped conduct on Brown in the years leading up to the shooting.

He also said he and his client are in it "for the long fight and look forward to their day in court." The lawsuit was filed in Dallas County in September 2020 against Jones and the Dallas Cowboys by a woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe, who alleged in the lawsuit that Jones forcibly grabbed her and kissed her on the mouth in September 2018. The initial lawsuit didn’t detail where the alleged incident happened, but in a refiled version of the lawsuit, she alleged it happened in the Tom Landry room at AT&T Stadium.

Article: In the video, Thalia Salinas, 23, sits surrounded by her four closest friends — Ruby Cruz, Brianna Valadez, Jackie Velazco and Desiree Cervantes — as they sing to her, celebrating another year of life. On July 25, the longtime friends were heading to the lake when, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, a Dodge Ram 4500 pulling a horse trailer swerved into oncoming traffic on U.S. "I gave each one of them their last hug, and I truly… I’m glad I did.” Ruby’s younger sister, Ana Cruz, said her final conversation with her sister came just hours before the crash. "Those were the last words that came out of my mouth that I loved.” Thalia’s older brother, Sal Salinas, remembers the constant energy and noise in their home when the girls were together. "Her favorite things to do were go to the beach, go to the lake, anything water… all five of them are regularly at her house… just watching videos, listening to music, a bunch of random laughter very loud through the walls here.” Anger over driver leaving scene without testing The driver accused of causing the crash, 37-year-old Kody Talley, was not tested for drugs or alcohol before being released from the scene, despite having what the families say is a lengthy and troubling criminal record. Commercial driving questions: At the time of the crash, Talley was reportedly driving for his father’s company, hauling a trailer loaded with horses — something the families say raises questions about whether he should have been behind the wheel at all, given his history.

Article: WYLIE, Texas — If students at Wylie High School don't comply with a new state law about the use, or more accurately, the lack of use, of their cell phones and other communication devices, they will be sent to see Student Services Secretary Beth McPherson. "I give them the top copy," she said, tearing off a duplicate receipt at her desk in a small office off the main hallway at the high school of approximately 3,000 students. Wylie ISD, like all other school districts across Texas, is working to comply with House Bill 1481, which requires all school districts and open-enrollment charter schools to adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal communication devices (cell phones, personal iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) while on school property during the school day. "The first day I was reaching, like where's my phone," said Wylie High School junior Julia Hudgins, admitting that it was a bit of an adjustment on Thursday, the first day of the school year. "There are some people that are just on their phones 24/7, sit in the back, take naps, just do whatever," Wylie High senior Eli Martin said of previous school years. "But now that's gone, I see them like they're sitting up, they're paying attention now." School districts are making exceptions for students who might need their phones to monitor glucose levels for diabetes or need them to operate hearing aid devices.

Article: Well, the implementation of that law -- which was passed by the Texas Legislature this year -- might vary from district to district, even if the intended effect is still the same: Students won't be able to use their phones in school. Here are the policies that several larger districts in North Texas have passed: Dallas ISD The new DISD policy bans cell phone use all day and includes escalating levels of punishment for each violation: 1st violation – phone confiscated, returned to parent/guardian 2nd – returned with $5 fee 3rd – returned with $10 fee 4th – returned with $15 fee The district decided that elementary teachers will collect cell phones and secure them during the day, and secondary campuses will give students a pouch to store their devices. Arlington ISD The Arlington district announced an "Away for the Day" cell phone policy, requiring students' personal devices -- including smartwatches, cell phones and tablets -- to be powered off and "out of sight" during all parts of the school day, including class time, transition between classes and at lunch. The police comes with four levels of discipline for each time a student violates the policy, from device confiscation and contacting a parent (first offense) to in-school suspension (third offense) and then, on a fourth violation, an assignment to the district's Choices program. Plano ISD The Plano district passed a policy requiring students to have all personal communication devices powered off and stored out of sight in their backpacks from the time they enter the building until they leave for the day. Duncanville ISD Duncanville students will have to power off their devices all day, although each individual campus will decide how the devices will be stored, according to the district's policy. Allen ISD Allen students will not be allowed to use phones or other communication devices from the time they arrive at school until they leave, including passing periods and at lunch, the new policy says.

Article: DALLAS — California Congressman Kevin Kiley, R- District 3, is one of the many Republicans who doesn't agree with any effort to redistrict mid-decade, like what is happening in Texas. And now that leaders in Democrat-run states such as California, Illinois and New York, are threatening to redraw their congressional lines to ice out the GOP, many blue state Republicans such as Kiley are growing increasingly alarmed that their seats will suddenly become vulnerable.

Article: HOUSTON — Billy Howton, a former Green Bay Packers star regarded as one of the most productive wide receivers of the pre-Super Bowl era who was a founder and the first president of the NFL Players Association, has died. Because of Billy’s advocacy as our first president, today’s players have a pension, disability benefits & a voice of their own in the business of football.” Howton scored the Packers' first receiving touchdown at Lambeau Field in 1957. He holds Green Bay's single-game franchise record with 257 receiving yards in a 1956 game against the Los Angeles Rams, and when he retired in 1963, he was the NFL's all-time leading receiver in receptions (503) and receiving yards (8,459). “For my money, Howton is the toughest pass receiver to cover in the National League,” Hall of Fame safety Emlen Tunnell said before the 1958 season, which was Howton’s last with the Packers. “He was an extremely dangerous receiver and had great technique.” After seven years in Green Bay, Howton was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1959 and then to Dallas as a member of the Cowboys' inaugural team in 1960. He represented the Packers at the first NFLPA meeting in 1956 and brought with him a list of four grievances that famously included a need for clean towels, shirts and jock straps for second practices — when NFL teams held two practices a day. He was elected as the organization's first president in 1958 and threatened to bring an antitrust suit against the NFL if it didn't establish a pension plan for retired players.

Article: Gavin Newsom, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and others about GOP-led redistricting efforts in Texas and a responding redistricting effort in heavily-Democratic California. "We have a responsibility to prove through the night of this Trump administration, the darkness of it all, that our flag is still there, with liberty and justice for all." Pelosi introduced California Gov. Newsom likewise called the Texas Democratic lawmakers' efforts and California's potential redistricting efforts bids to "defend democracy." "We are trying to defend democracy as opposed to see it destroyed district by district, and we will stand firm," Newsom said. We will pick up five seats with the consent of the people and that's the difference between the approach we're taking and the approach they're taking." Watch Friday's full press conference below Newsom said he's calling for a special election in California in November, and the California Legislature has until Aug. In response to a question about how voters can be confident California's redistricting effort would be a "one-time exception" to California's independent redistricting commission, Newsom offered the following statement: "I'd say we want to do it for the '26, '28, '30 ballots just for congressional representatives alone. What is happening in Texas, what is being pushed out by the Trump administration beyond Texas, is something we thought we would never see where people's lives, their representation, their participation is willingly stifled, violently stifled," California Assembly Member Isaac Bryan said. "This is not just about lines on the map, this is about lives on the line.” Ahead of the press conferences, the Texas House again failed to establish quorum Friday, as our sister station KVUE reported. In addition to daily fines, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that he and Comptroller Kelly Hancock have enacted a new policy to prevent the absent lawmakers from having their paycheck, or per diem, deposited electronically. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also filed a lawsuit Friday in a bid for the Supreme Court of Texas to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic state representatives who left the state. I have asked the Texas Supreme Court to declare what has been clear from the beginning: that the runaway members have officially vacated their offices in the Texas House.” In addition to filing the petition, Paxton and Burrows moved to enforce civil arrest warrants in other states.

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.” One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times — Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 — with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. Lovell and fellow astronauts Fred Haise and Jack Swigert received renewed fame with the retelling of the Apollo 13 mission in the 1995 movie “Apollo 13" where actor Tom Hanks — portraying Lovell — famously said, “Houston, we have a problem.” In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death affected him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises.” Lovell had ice water in his veins like other astronauts, but he didn't display the swagger some had, just quiet confidence, said Smithsonian Institution historian Roger Launius. I measure risk.'” Lovell spent about 30 days in space across 4 missions In all, Lovell flew four space missions — and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. “He was a member of really the first generation of American astronauts and went on to inspire multiple generations of Americans to look at the stars and want to explore,” said Bruce McClintock, who leads the RAND Corp. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing.” Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn't have solutions to get home.” “We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told NASA's historian. Lovell showed a “leadership role and heroic efforts in the recovery of Apollo 13.” By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. He regretted never being able to walk on the moon The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13."

Article: The Senate confirmed Long on a 53-44 vote despite Democrats’ concerns about the Republican’s past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after Trump nominated him. Before Long's confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS.

Article: MCALLEN, Texas — A judge on Friday was considering a Trump administration request to end a decades-old policy on protections for immigrant children in federal custody that the government says is inhibiting its immigration crackdown. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.” “It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Detroit safety Morice Norris was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions' preseason game against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run. ATLANTA, Georgia -- Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. "It's never good when they bring out the stretchers." With 6:31 remaining in the fourth quarter, an official announced the game had been suspended "per New York" with the Lions leading the Falcons 17-10.

Article: That particular wave is just coming off the coast of Africa, meaning that even if it were to eventually impact the U.S., it wouldn't be for another 10 to 12 days, giving us plenty of time to keep a watchful eye on it. August 3 There is now a low chance for development over the eastern Atlantic as a tropical wave is expected to move off the coast of Africa in the next day or two. July 29 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms and two named storms, the Atlantic Basin remains quiet for now with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 28 Update While the central and eastern Pacific basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: "We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements." One of NASA's most traveled astronauts in the agency's first decade, Lovell flew four times - Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 - with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth. In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth's orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew's Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968. ''Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of (NASA) personnel.'' A retired Navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a NASA historian that his brush with death did affect him. I'm still breathing.' So, I don't worry about crises." And the mission's retelling in the popular 1995 movie "Apollo 13" brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame - thanks in part to Lovell's movie persona reporting "Houston, we have a problem," a phrase he didn't exactly utter. I measure risk.'" Lovell spent a total of nearly 30 days in space In all, Lovell flew four space missions - and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds. "What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not," he remarked. "I think in the history of space flight, I would say that Jim was one of the pillars of the early space flight program," Gene Kranz, NASA's legendary flight director, once said. Lovell was immortalized by Tom Hanks' portrayal But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell's last mission - immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell - that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut. The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert was on the way to the moon in April 1970, when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth. That, Lovell recalled, was "the most frightening moment in this whole thing." Then oxygen began escaping and "we didn't have solutions to get home." "We knew we were in deep, deep trouble," he told NASA's historian. In Hanks' version, it became "Houston, we have a problem." What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of NASA's finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's walks on the moon nine months earlier. The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon "is my one regret," Lovell said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission. Hanks posted a tribute to Lovell on Instagram Friday, writing, "There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive - and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, "The mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction." And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal. In 1994, he and Jeff Kluger wrote "Lost Moon," the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the film "Apollo 13." In one of the final scenes, Lovell appeared as a Navy captain, the rank he actually had.

Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites Friday morning. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The judge pressed government attorney Joshua McCroskey on why President Donald Trump's administration was holding children at the border for longer than the 72 hours laid out in the agreement when border arrests have reached record lows. She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they "are deteriorating." "It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it's willful," said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama. In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement. The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," where a lawsuit alleges detainees' constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration's efforts, even though Trump's tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

READ RELATED: Judge Lina Hidalgo's 'penny tax proposal' fails to pass; Commissioners Court meeting turns to chaos Hidalgo invited several children to attend the meeting, which devolved into commissioners arguing with and reprimanding Hidalgo. Ramsey said he feels it's the commissioners court's responsibility to "explore every option for ensuring our meetings remain professional and productive, including, if warranted, the potential removal of a court member." According to Texas state law, the county judge can be removed for incompetency or misconduct, but Ramsey acknowledged such a move would "involve significant, important, legal and procedural steps." ABC13 reached out to Judge Hidalgo regarding Ramsey's comments, but there has been no response. The decision to remove or keep an elected official is one that should be made by the voters through the electoral process."

Article: A shooting outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters on Friday left a police officer dead and officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency shaken. Citing a senior law enforcement official, The New York Times reported the shooter, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was fixated on the Covid vaccine, which he blamed for his health problems. In response to the shooting and reports of White’s motivations, newly appointed CDC Director Susan Monarez convened an online all-hands meeting of the agency division that focuses on vaccines — the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It is not fair to all of you who’ve given so much to contribute to public health,” Monarez told employees during the meeting Saturday, according to a recording reviewed by MSNBC. One said they felt like “sitting ducks.” As the leaders spoke, dozens of staffers posted messages in the meeting chat, many naming Kennedy, who oversees the CDC at the Department of Health and Human Services, citing his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines and vilifying the health agencies he now leads. One employee described the shooting as “the culmination of ongoing animosity toward CDC and the work that we do — not a one-off incident.” Another named Kennedy in a comment that drew dozens of supportive emoji reactions, writing: “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation. In videos from anti-vaccine conferences between 2013 and 2019, he likened the agency’s vaccine work to “fascism” and “child abuse,” called it a “cesspool of corruption” and said it was filled with profiteers. At a 2013 conference, when asked about why the CDC had failed to acknowledge the autism epidemic (which he falsely linked to vaccines), Kennedy said it was like the Holocaust. During the pandemic, Kennedy repeatedly framed the CDC and other HHS agencies as “corrupt,” falsely suggested Covid-19 was a “bioweapon,” and lied about the dangers of Covid vaccines, calling them “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” “The hatred RFK and his allies have spent their lives stoking puts a target on the backs of anyone in public health,” said one senior official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the agency and so they could speak critically about Kennedy. Monarez called it “a good question” and said the CDC had been in “constant communication” with his office and that “more will be coming.” Kennedy did post a message of support to the CDC from his HHS account shortly after the meeting. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.” The shooting marks a low point in an already dark period for public health.

Article: Temperatures will hit the triple digits in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys on Thursday, while interior regions of Los Angeles County will see temperatures in the 90s, according to the National Weather Service. California California fires are burning and incoming heat wave could make things worse A widespread heat wave is expected to intensify fire concerns across California as temperatures rise and landscapes further dry out. “A slight cooling trend is [forecast for] Friday through the weekend but temperatures will remain above normal away from the immediate coast well into next week.” Advertisement The sustained hot weather will continue to dry out vegetation, increasing the risk of wildfire starts and worsening conditions around blazes already burning across Central and Southern California, including the state’s largest this year: the 96,106-acre Gifford fire in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, quickly grew to more than 1,000 acres, prompting evacuation orders in Piru, Castaic, Val Verde and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles county fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by onshore winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour, according to Cal Fire and the National Weather Service. Conditions on Thursday will be even hotter in the Inland Empire and inland areas of San Diego County, where the weather service has issued regional heat advisories through Friday evening. The blaze, dubbed the Canyon fire, grew to 600 acres in a little over an hour prompting evacuation orders in nearby communities of Piru, Castiac, Val Verde, and Del Valle and putting residents in neighboring Santa Clarita on high alert. Around 100 firefighters from the Ventura and Los Angeles County fire department were quickly deployed to combat the fire, which was burning at a rapid rate of spread, fanned by on shore winds, according to Cal Fire. “We’ll have pretty gusty onshore winds, anywhere from 15 to 25 miles an hour, with gusts to 20 to 40 across the interior locations each afternoon and evening, strongest across the I-5 corridor, Antelope Valley and southwest Santa Barbara County coast,” Black said. “With that, we’ll have an extended period of elevated fire weather risk.” California is already on pace for the worst wildfire year in recent history, driven by several large fires in Central and Southern California — including the Gifford fire and the devastating January firestorms in Los Angeles County. Advertisement As of Thursday morning, the Gifford fire was 15% contained, according to federal officials, after hot conditions and continued fire growth challenged firefighters and triggered additional evacuation orders and warnings for rural communities near the Los Padres National Forest.

Article: DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — International condemnation grew Saturday over Israel’s decision for a military takeover of Gaza City, while tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in what local media called one of the largest anti-government protests in recent months following 22 months of war. special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday to discuss a new proposal to end the war, according to two officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the media. Mediators Egypt and Qatar are preparing a new ceasefire framework that would include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for the war’s end and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, two Arab officials have told The Associated Press. Health officials said that 20 Palestinians seeking aid were shot dead Saturday and 11 adults died of malnutrition-related causes in the past 24 hours, as the criticism of Israel came with pleas to allow far more food to reach people in the besieged enclave. ‘Shut the country down’ Hostages’ families pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government amid new fears for the 50 remaining hostages, with 20 of them thought to be alive and struggling. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, called on Israelis including the powerful Histadrut labor union to “help us save the hostages, the soldiers and the state of Israel” and appeared to call for a general strike: “Shut the country down.” WATCH: Netanyahu’s Gaza takeover won’t end Hamas influence in the region, Mideast analyst says A joint statement by nine countries including Germany, Britain, France and Canada said that they “strongly reject” Israel’s decision for the large-scale military operation, saying it will worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” endanger hostages and further risk mass displacement. A separate statement by more than 20 countries including ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar along with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates called Israel’s decision a “dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” Meanwhile, Russia said Israel’s plan will aggravate the “already extremely dramatic situation” in Gaza. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites In the north, Israeli fire killed at least nine and wounded over 200 as people sought aid entering Gaza through the Zikim crossing, said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service in the area. With temperatures reaching above 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) in Gaza, families fanned themselves with pieces of cardboard or metal trays and slept on the ground outside their tents, while some women collected water well before dawn. More deaths from hunger Gaza’s Health Ministry said the new adult deaths from malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours brought the total to 114 since it began counting such deaths in June.

Article: WASHINGTON — The White House is considering inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Alaska, where President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, according to a senior U.S. But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decision taken without Ukraine were "decisions against peace," adding, "They will not achieve anything." The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy's message by early Saturday. The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin's first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered. But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president's seeming unwillingness to end the war. Although Trump's agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News Saturday. "For Russia, this isn't just about territory, it's about controlling Ukraine as a whole." He also noted that Trump would likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only "another step" in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal. The last time Alaska hosted a high-stakes diplomatic gathering was in March 2021, when senior officials from the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. The White House had made a Putin meeting with Zelenskyy a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. If Zelenskyy were to travel to Alaska, it is not clear if he and Putin would ever be in the same room, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. The surge in diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine comes after Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow ahead of a deadline on Friday that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. Zelenskyy said defiantly on Saturday that Ukrainians "will not give their land to occupiers." Trump said Friday that between Russia and Ukraine, "there'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both." Administration officials were working on Saturday to try to gain support for a potential ceasefire from Ukrainian government and European leaders.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

Article: The order came at the request of AG Ken Paxton, whom O’Rourke accused in a separate lawsuit of going on a "fishing expedition, constitutional rights be damned." (The Texas Tribune) Former U.S. Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton’s request for a temporary injunction, barring O’Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton’s contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either “directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators” to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for “unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators’ Constitutional duties.” O’Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O’Rourke said Paxton was trying to “make examples out of those who fight so that others won’t.” “Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, [President Donald] Trump and Abbott have on power in Texas,” O’Rourke said. With few tools to stop the map’s passage through the Republican-dominated Legislature, Democrats called on their one failsafe, leaving the state to deny quorum, or the minimum number of members required for the chamber to function. But this time, Republicans have gone on the offensive, filing lawsuits to cut off financial support; asking Illinois courts to enforce Texas’ civil warrants; investigating members and donors for bribery; and, in an unprecedented move, asking the Texas Supreme Court to expel lawmakers who left.

Article: Having finished 15 points adrift of their city rivals last season, Rangers are already a one behind Celtic before Brendan Rodgers' side play their game in hand in Aberdeen on Sunday. If Rangers get through their Euro tie after Tuesday's second leg against Plzen, they will postpone the league match against St Mirren on 24 August to prepare for the play-off tie, which means they could be seven behind by the time Celtic visit Ibrox the following week. It can be argued they were fortunate to escape Motherwell with a point last weekend, while Rangers had to play the final half hour against Dundee with 10 men before captain James Tavernier came off the bench to rescue another with his late spot kick. A "disappointed" Martin admitted: "There was just general lethargy and no speed in the first half." After last week's draw at Fir Park, Martin had questioned the mentality of some of his players, complaining that some "have to drop their ego", and was delighted with the reaction against Plzen. This time, he was "pleased with the response of the team when we went down to 10 men and we could've won the game in the end, but the mentality has to come from the very first kick of the match". Martin accepted some of the blame, admitting: "In hindsight, I should've made some changes to inject that energy in the team, but I explained my decision before the game and maybe I could've changed that now the game is finished. "We're learning about the group all the time, so that's a lesson learnt today." BBC pundit and former Rangers striker described them as "Jekyll and Hyde" but pointed out that the same happened under the previous two team bosses - Philippe Clement and Barry Ferguson - last season.

Article: atomic attack that killed tens of thousands and left survivors who hope their harrowing memories can help make their hometown the last place on Earth to be hit by a nuclear bomb. WATCH: ‘The Devil Reached Toward the Sky’ documents motivation and development of the atomic bomb About 2,600 people, including representatives from more than 90 countries, attended a memorial event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke, among other guests. “Even after the war ended, the atomic bomb brought invisible terror,” 93-year-old survivor Hiroshi Nishioka said in his speech at the memorial, noting that many who had survived without severe wounds started bleeding from gums and losing hair and died. “In order to make Nagasaki the last atomic bombing site now and forever, we will go hand-in-hand with global citizens and devote our utmost efforts toward the abolition of nuclear weapons and the realization of everlasting world peace.” ‘A world without war’ Survivors and their families gathered Saturday in rainy weather at Peace Park and nearby Hypocenter Park, located below the bomb’s exact detonation spot, hours before the official ceremony. The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, also rang together again after one of the bells that had gone missing following the attack was restored by volunteers. Passing down lessons Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack isn’t distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future. “I seek a world where nuclear weapons are never used and everyone can live in peace.” READ MORE: At 80th anniversary of Hiroshima bombing, survivors fear lessons may be forgotten as nuclear threat rises In the hope of passing down the lessons of history to current and future generations, Takeshita visits schools to share her experience with children. “When you grow up and remember what you learned today, please think what each of you can do to prevent war,” Takeshita told students during a school visit earlier this week. Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said that she thinks of the growing absence of those she had worked with, and that fuels her desire to document the lives of others who are still alive. “So I think we don’t have to get depressed yet.” Nagasaki hosted a “peace forum” on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. They criticize the Japanese government’s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer because Japan, as an American ally, says it needs U.S. In Ishiba’s speech, the prime minister reiterated Japan’s pursuit of a nuclear-free world, pledging to promote dialogue and cooperation between countries with nuclear weapons and nonnuclear states at the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review conference scheduled for April and May 2026 in New York. “Countries must move from words to action by strengthening the global disarmament regime,” with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, at the center, complemented by the momentum created by the nuclear weapons ban treaty, said U.N.

Article: European officials presented their own Ukraine peace proposals to the United States on Saturday as President Donald Trump prepared for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war. The Wall Street Journal said European officials had presented a counterproposal that included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken and that any territory exchange must be reciprocal, with firm security guarantees. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke and pledged to find a "just and lasting peace" in Ukraine and "unwavering support" for Zelenskyy, while welcoming Trump's efforts to end the fighting, a Downing Street spokesperson said. "The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle." He had earlier rejected any territorial concessions, saying "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." The Trump administration is considering inviting Zelenskyy to join the U.S. "Ukraine's future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now," he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer.

In a brief post on the social media platform X, UEFA called the former national team member “a talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times”. The United Nations says that more than 1,000 people have been killed near aid distribution sites and aid convoys in Gaza since the launch of the GHF, a United States- and Israel-backed aid distribution system, in late May.

Article: Mars rock found in Niger sells for millions in New York - now the country wants answers 40 minutes ago Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save EPA The Martian meteorite found in Niger went on display in New York before it was auctioned "Brazen! He makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer. At first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find – less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour. Reuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth Sotheby's strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa). An Italian academic article published last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Niger's Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by "a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed". Meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. According to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was "sold by the local community to an international dealer" and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo. "As with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved." A spokesperson added that Sotheby's was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and "we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised". The academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the country's vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Niger's cultural and natural heritage – including anything that has fallen from outer space - returned. But, according to a 2019 study by international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. AFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks Morocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites - more than 1,000 - found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara. More than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a "Saharan gold rush", fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours. It's a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but it's the same state in all our countries." Prof Sereno hopes that the Sotheby's sale will prove a turning-point - firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly "if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it".

Article: What it means to be 'culturally' Irish in 2025 is complicated - as Ed Sheeran has shown 38 minutes ago Share Save Fergal Keane • @fergalkeane47 Special correspondent Share Save BBC He sang wistfully of the English town that shaped his life. But I can't wait to go home." Ed Sheeran grew up in Framlingham in Suffolk and its rolling hills and magnificent castle inspired his hit single, Castle on the Hill. "I can be allowed to feel a connection to a place half my family is from." Yet he was accused of being Irish "when it suits him" by one poster. Another wrote on X: "I've seen B*Witched live and have watched a couple of Gaelic football games, which I think gives me an even more legitimate claim to be culturally Irish than Ed Sheeran." Getty Images Ed Sheeran said: 'I class my culture as Irish. "That doesn't mean to say he doesn't like or love being British, that is part of him too." Certainly it is much easier to speak of an Irish identity in Britain now that there is peace in Northern Ireland. As the Belfast South MP, Claire Hanna, who is now leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told parliament during a St Patrick's Day debate in 2022: "Many are moving on from the traditional binaries of the past and embracing the 'or both' part of the Good Friday agreement, not feeling that they have to decide between being British and Irish if they do not wish to do so." Sheeran's declaration raises this point once again, and prompts the deeper question of what cultural "Irishness" really is today. Identity versus citizenship Professor Linda Connolly, director of sociology at Maynooth University in County Kildare, argues that Ed Sheeran's statement is about an idea of identity that is bigger than where you were born or what you write on a census form. I am also a Cork, Kerry and Waterford person' (County Cork pictured) For many unionists, staunch political loyalty to Britain and the Monarchy, sits alongside a deep attachment to the land they have lived on for hundreds of years. There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup. Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles Everyone has their own menu of what being "culturally Irish" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously. It runs a wide spectrum of styles, influences, opinions and genres - from Oasis (born in Manchester to Irish parents), the rappers Kneecap, novelist Sally Rooney, the Irish actress of Nigerian descent Demi Isaac Oviawe, the London-born playwright Martin McDonagh of The Banshees of Inisherin fame. Getty Images Noel and Liam Gallagher were born in Manchester to Irish parents The core members of The Beatles all had Irish grandparents or great grandparents, prompting John Lennon to tell a concert in Dublin: "We're all Irish." That was in 1963 – some 62 years before Ed Sheeran's declaration. There are many voices too from the Irish Protestant tradition in Ulster – the singer Van Morrison and the novelist Jan Carson, who has written about growing up in an evangelical Christian home, and says she now feels "much more ease and comfort with an Irish identity than a British one". Getty Images Culturally Irish can mean a sense of a particular landscape - like the world of "the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting," evoked by Shane McGowan of the Pogues. Today, it is undoubtedly easier these days for a big mainstream star like Sheeran to embrace an Irish cultural identity in Britain than it would have been several decades ago. I think of the powerful song Nothing But the Same Old Story by Paul Brady, about an Irishman in Britain during the 1970s, amid the ongoing IRA campaign: "In their eyes, we're nothing but a bunch of murderers." Cross-fertilisation of cultures Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including legendary BBC presenter Terry Wogan and musicians such as U2, Thin Lizzy, Sinead O'Connor, the Pogues "and now Ed Sheeran!" Yet all of these icons are building on the foundations laid by the unacknowledged millions who came to Britain over many centuries. In those days, most Irish immigrants found expression of their culture in the ballrooms of places like Kilburn in northwest London, or the Astoria in Manchester, or the Irish pubs which often catered to clientele from a specific county. For two millennia there are records of the Irish trading, settling, and inter-marrying in Britain; they shared a common language with western Scotland and the Isle of Man, and a Druidic culture with the rest of Britain. Getty Images Ros Scanlon credits Irish cultural figures for much of the changed atmosphere, including the late Sinead O'Connor One of the bestselling songwriters of early 19th century Britain was Irishman Thomas Moore. His story typifies the often complex nature of cultural relationships: he was a champion of Irish liberty, but his great song "The Minstrel Boy" – written for rebels fighting Britain – is played by the band of the Irish Guards at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day. "The physical distance between Ireland and Britain has diminished in the Ryanair era… It seems to me also that Irish migration to Britain is now more likely to be temporary - people may come for a few years, then go home - whereas previously it was a more permanent departure." 'I'm an Irishman, and a Londoner - and much else too' I should declare an interest. Fergal Keane today, alongside a photo of him as an aspiring young folk singer back in Limerick in the 1980s The Irish language and music is an essential part of my cultural makeup. But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: "And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here." My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. 'The old battle of identities is far from finished' The nature of identity is evolving - in Ireland it is absorbing the influences of other cultures, but also influencing those cultures. Professor Nic Dháibhéid hopes the prominence of Irish cultural identities in Britain will prompt a greater interest in the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly among the under-25s who, as she sees it, "will have no memory of the Troubles, and so there is an even greater need to ensure that there is good mutual understanding between the people on our two islands." The big British audiences for Kneecap, to take an example, didn't happen because young people had a sudden awakening about the problems of life in nationalist west Belfast. Press Association The Derry Girls phenomenon is real, says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city It is important to recognise that the cultural influence can be polarising. One member of the band, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig. "The Kneecap phenomenon is real, as is the Derry Girls one," says Professor Nic Dhábhéid, also referencing the show inspired by the screenwriter Lisa McGee's upbringing in the city in the 1990s. I watch them navigate the challenges and opportunities of different and overlapping identities, encouraging them to follow James Joyce's advice and fly past any barriers others put in their way.

Article: "These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties," Serena says, "but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it." Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. "If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round." But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. Steven Oakes Lucy and Serena say the drinks can make them feel calm if life gets stressful The "functional beverage" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: Lion's Mane extract – a type of mushroom found in east Asian countries L-theanine – an amino acid found primarily in green and black tea Ashwagandha – a herb cultivated in areas of Asia, Africa, and Europe Magnesium – a mineral the human body needs to function properly These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could "prevent, treat or cure disease" were a step too far. Getty Images Clockwise from left: Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha root and powder, magnesium supplement pills, and black tea - a source of L-theanine Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. "In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks." Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. "I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option." Emily May Emily May says older clientele at the coffee shop where she works are really into wellness drinks Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, "crack on", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a "therapy session or a massage at the end of the month". "I'm ADHD," Emily says, "so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down." TRIP via ASA Trip's banned advert made health claims which are prohibited, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said

Article: 41 minutes ago Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save Universal Pictures/Prime Video The whole film shows either Ice Cube's computer screen or his face as seen on the monitor's camera Film critics have delivered a verdict: the new version of War of the Worlds – which stars Ice Cube as a man who must save humanity from an alien invasion without leaving his desk – is bad. 'Verges on parody' Lon Harris, executive producer of the This Week in Startups podcast, stoked the conversation this week when he posted: "Dipping below like 5% on Rotten Tomatoes has basically the same appeal to me as breaking 90%. "I watch a lot of movies, there's so much content coming out, and most of it is bland and forgettable." Harris was intrigued enough to watch War of the Worlds, and it duly lived down to his expectations. "It's very silly, Ice Cube's solo performance just reacting to things on his laptop screen verges at times on parody and frequently made me laugh, and there's a whole subplot involving Amazon drone deliveries that's so on-the-nose it's almost unbelievable that they included it," he says. "That's more interesting than just 'another alien invasion movie' to me." After its initial battering, one critic has now taken pity on War of the Worlds, having enjoyed watching it. It's certainly stupid, but it's also a great deal of fun." That write-up, which concluded that the "movie is a mess, but an uproarious one", was deemed positive by Rotten Tomatoes so has nudged the film's Tomatometer score up from 0% to the giddy heights of 4% at the time of writing. Getty Images Samurai Cop is famously bad but built up such a fanbase that it got a sequel 24 years later Truly atrocious movies are preferable to those that are simply forgettable, according to Timon Singh, who set up the Bristol Bad Film Club a decade ago. "In comparison, Samurai Cop is technically a terrible film, but it's 90 minutes of pure enjoyable terrible acting, awful fight scenes, and once you've seen it, you're never going to forget it. "Whereas you'll probably forget Transformers: The Last Knight while you're watching it."

Those claims – and the app's sudden surge in popularity – wiped $600bn (£446bn) or 17% off the market value of chip giant Nvidia, marking the largest one-day loss for a single stock in the history of the US stock market. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen referred to the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment," a reference to the Soviet satellite that had kicked off the space race between the US and the USSR more than a half century earlier. Bloomberg via Getty Images Shares of Japanese semiconductor-related companies extended a late January drop after the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek prompted a selloff in US tech stocks Still relevant It has now been six months since DeepSeek stunned the world. Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that "with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model". When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based. In online forums, users explain how to run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China - a workaround they believe can protect their data from being shared surreptitiously. "China was seen as playing catch-up in large language models until this point, with competitive models but always trailing the best western ones," policy analyst Wendy Chang of the Mercator Institute for China Studies told the BBC.

Article: Man's anger over number plate mix-up parking penalty 33 minutes ago Share Save Dan Martin & Ben Carr BBC News, Leicester Share Save Richard Lynn Richard Lynn said his vehicle was recorded entering the car park - but another with a nearly identical number plate was clocked leaving hours later A man was wrongly issued with a parking charge after his car was mixed up with another vehicle with a nearly identical number plate. Richard Lynn said that on 18 March 2024, he paid £1.70 to park for about 30 minutes in Rushton's Yard car park in Ashby, Leicestershire, but later received a demand for £165 from solicitors representing private firm Horizon Parking. The 53-year-old said photographic evidence, provided by the company, showed his Hyundai entering the car park - but a Kia with an identical number plate bar one letter leaving nine hours later. Supplied Horizon Parking provided photos showing Mr Lynn's car (left) with its number plate starting FH6 - and another car with an FP6 registration Reflecting on the situation, Mr Lynn said: "It's ridiculous. "The result of this is that I received a pretty nasty letter, threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay a fine I should not have been issued with in the first place." On 25 March 2024, Mr Lynn was sent a letter demanding £85 - £51 if he paid within 14 days. However, he said he only became aware of the matter in July this year - when he received a letter from solicitors acting on behalf of Horizon Parking demanding £165. Mr Lynn said he moved house in December 2022 but said he had, in error, not notified the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) of his change of address until some time in "early 2024".

Article: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposts video of pastors saying women shouldn't vote toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reposted and praised a video interview of a self-described Christian nationalist pastor whose church doesn't believe women shouldn't be allowed to vote. Doug Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, said during the interview with CNN that, "Women are the kind of people that people come out of." "The wife and mother, who is the chief executive of the home, is entrusted with three or four or five eternal souls," he continued. In his repost of the interview on the platform X, Hegseth added, "All of Christ for All of Life." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told NPR in an emailed statement on Saturday that Hegseth is a "proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches," which was founded by Wilson. In the CNN video, a congregant in Wilson's church explained that her husband "is the head of our household and I do submit to him." A fellow pastor also said that families should vote as a household, with the husband and father casting the vote. Andrew Whitehead, a sociology professor at Indiana University Indianapolis and an expert on Christian nationalism, told NPR the goal for Wilson and his followers is to spread these ideas across the country – and ultimately make them enforceable. "It really does matter if the Secretary of Defense is retweeting a video with very particular views about whether women should be able to vote or serve in combat roles or if slavery really isn't all that bad," Whitehead said.

Article: Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home’s front yard Officials plan to seek the death penalty for a Tennessee man charged with killing 4 TITPONVILLE, Tenn. -- Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a Tennessee man charged with killing the parents, grandmother and uncle of an infant found abandoned in a home's front yard on Thursday. Austin Robert Drummond, 28, appeared by a video feed from jail before a judge in Tiptonville, two days after he was arrested in the killings that set the mostly rural region of western Tennessee on edge. The Dyer County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that a caller reported a minivan or midsize SUV had dropped the infant at a “random individual’s front yard.” The sheriff’s office later said they were working with investigators in neighboring Lake County, where four people had been found dead from gunshot wounds. Hours before Tuesday's arrest, Jackson Police posted a roughly 20-second video surveillance clip showing someone they said was Drummond wearing camouflage and carrying a firearm, trying to enter the door of an unspecified building. Jackson Police Chief Thom Corley said the calls from the public helped officers arrest Drummond, who had been staying in a vacant building near the woods where he was taken into custody.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior FBI official who served as acting director in the first weeks of the Trump administration and resisted demands to turn over the names of agents who participated in the Jan. The circumstances of Brian Driscoll’s ouster were not immediately clear, but his final day is Friday, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss the personnel move by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The news comes amid a much broader personnel purge that has unfolded over the last several months under the leadership of current director FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Driscoll, a veteran agent who worked international counterterrorism investigations in New York and had also commanded the bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team, had most recently served as acting director in charge of the Critical Incident Response Group, which deploys manpower and resources to crisis situations. Emil Bove, the then-senior Justice Department official who made the request and was last week confirmed for a seat on a federal appeals court, wrote a memo accusing the FBI’s top leaders of “insubordination.” Responding to Bove’s request, the FBI ultimately provided personnel details about several thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. In April, for instance, the bureau reassigned several agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, two people familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Another agent, Michael Feinberg, has said publicly that he was told to resign or accept a demotion amid scrutiny from leadership of his friendship with Peter Strzok, a lead agent on the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation who was fired by the Justice Department in 2018 following revelations that he had exchanged negative text messages about President Donald Trump with an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page.

Article: futures mostly higher WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. Wildlife biologists and a state veterinarian who visited the trail near Tupper Lake, New York, on Wednesday saw that the moose was severely emaciated and showed other signs of advanced disease. In addition, information gathered from this animal will help DEC better understand and manage moose in New York,” Jacqueline Lendrum, director of the agency's Division of Fish and Wildlife, said in a prepared statement. Jennifer Bloodgood of the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine said a necropsy will be performed to help authorities understand the cause of the moose's decline and to provide more information on threats to the large mammals in New York state.

That came after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two tanker planes to protest against Britain’s support for Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The police have only been able to arrest a fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offenses, and most of those have been given street bail and allowed to go home,” Defend Our Juries, which organized the protest, said in a statement. “This is a major embarrassment to (the government), further undermining the credibility of this widely ridiculed law, brought in to punish those exposing the government’s own crimes.” London’s Metropolitan Police Service quickly hit back, saying this wasn’t true and that many of those who gathered in the square were onlookers, media or people who didn’t hold placards supporting the group. “We are confident that anyone who came to Parliament Square today to hold a placard expressing support for Palestine Action was either arrested or is in the process of being arrested,” the police force said in a statement. The government moved to ban Palestine Action after the activists broke into a British air force base in southern England on June 20 to protest British military support for the Israel-Hamas war. “Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” Defend Our Juries said on its website. The arrests outside Parliament came amid what is expected to be a busy weekend of demonstrations in London as the war in Gaza and concerns about immigration spur protests and counterprotests across the United Kingdom. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has angered Israel with plans to recognize a Palestinian state later this year, many Palestinian supporters in Britain criticize the government for not doing enough to end the war in Gaza. “This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.

(AKP via AP) BANGKOK -- Three Thai soldiers on patrol were wounded Saturday when one stepped on a land mine in territory along the border with Cambodia, Thailand’s army announced. The army’s statement said the incident took place in Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by the Cambodian side.” The Ottawa Convention, also called the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, is an international agreement banning the weapons’ use, and both Thailand and Cambodia have committed to it. A statement from Thailand’s foreign ministry said the incident confirmed the Thai army’s findings “that new land mines are being laid in blatant violation of international law.” It also noted this was the third such incident in less than a month. Winthai Suvaree, charged that Saturday’s mine explosion constituted “a significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful resolution of problems.” A statement issued in response by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied Thailand’s allegation that Cambodia had laid new mines. “We have not, and will not, plant new land mines,” said the statement, noting that Cambodia is a party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty Convention, “and has an internationally recognized record of removing, not deploying, these indiscriminate weapons." It noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970.

Britain’s unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in the three months through May, the highest level in four years, signaling that previous tax increases and uncertainty about the global economy are weighing on employers.

Article: Australian authorities say the Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral in four decades Crown-of-thorns starfish are seen at Tern Island on the northern Great Barrier Reef in far North Queensland, Australia, on Jan. (Australian Institute of Marine Science via AP) MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say. But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths — caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change — have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday. The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world’s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said. Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest — and fourth ever recorded — mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world’s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. Coral reefs are considered a “unique and threatened system” due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018. That report said “tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.” The report said back-to-back big bleaching events at the Great Barrier Reef in the mid 2010s “suggest that the research community may have underestimated climate risks for coral reefs.” “Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.

Article: Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir, accusing them of promoting a "false narrative" and "secessionism." SRINAGAR, India -- Indian authorities have banned 25 books in Kashmir that they say propagate “false narratives” and “secessionism” in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019. It said such books played “a critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.” The action was taken following “investigations and credible intelligence” about “systemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature” that was “often disguised as historical or political commentary,” it said. A year earlier to that, police arrested a college lecturer on charges he gave his students an English exam filled with questions attacking a crackdown on demonstrations challenging Indian rule in the region. “It only exposes the insecurities and limited understanding of those behind such authoritarian actions, and the contradiction in proudly hosting the ongoing Book Festival.” Banning books is not common in India, but authorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi have increasingly raided independent media houses, jailed journalists and sought to re-write history in school and university textbooks to promote the Hindu nationalist vision of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Article: Texas Democrats have prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump Texas Democrats who left state prevent vote, for now, on Trump's efforts to add GOP House seats State Reps. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. The Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the long-standing balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. “We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state's hallmark machismo to call the Democrats “un-Texan.” “Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said. Hours after Monday's halted House session, a gaggle of Democrats — state lawmakers who left and members of Congress whose lines would be redrawn — mocked Abbott as the weak figure in this battle.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions.

Article: (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) When Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to try to prevent the Republican-led Legislature from redrawing the state's congressional districts, it marked the latest episode in a long national history of gerrymandering. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: “The Constitution supplies no objective measure for assessing whether a districting map treats a political party fairly.” The Supreme Court noted that partisan gerrymandering claims could continue to be decided in state courts under their own constitutions and laws. In a 2023 case from Alabama, the high court said the congressional districts drawn by the state's Republican-led Legislature likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting strength of Black residents.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

Article: Republican Nate Morris warmed up a recent crowd of party faithful by gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey Mitch McConnell's legacy comes under fire in Kentucky race to replace him in the Senate Tech entrepreneur Nate Morris, a candidate for United States Senate, talks with reporters at the annual Fancy Farm picnic Saturday, Aug. -- Republican Nate Morris had deftly warmed up a crowd of party faithful, gushing about President Donald Trump and recounting his own life’s journey — from hardscrabble childhood to wealthy entrepreneur — when he turned his attention to the man he wants to replace, Sen. While bashing Kentucky's longest-serving senator at a GOP dinner on the eve of Saturday's Fancy Farm picnic, a tradition-laden stop on the state's political circuit, Morris was cut off in midsentence by a party activist in the crowd, who noted that McConnell isn't seeking reelection and pointedly asked Morris: “What are you running on?” Morris touted his hard line stance on immigration and defended Trump's tariffs as a boon for American manufacturing. “Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell told a Republican crowd that included Morris at a pre-picnic breakfast in Mayfield. McConnell endorsed Trump in 2024, but in a biography by Michael Tackett of The Associated Press, released shortly before the election, McConnell described him as “a despicable human being.” Morris, who started a waste management technology company, says the senator has been insufficiently loyal to Trump and allowed festering issues like immigration and the national debt to grow worse during his years in Senate leadership. "It seems, to me, maybe just maybe, Mitch’s time to leave the Senate was a long time ago." McConnell had his customary front-row seat for much of the event but wasn't there for Morris' remarks.

Article: (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) FILE - Bill Clinton, Founder and Board Chair of the Clinton Foundation & 42nd President of the United States, speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative, on Monday, Sept. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File) Former President Bill Clinton plans big changes for this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting “by necessity” to address the changing landscape for global development and increasing needs driven by war and climate disasters. “We need to redefine how we show up, how we work, and how we find ways to honor our common humanity,” Clinton wrote in a letter to the CGI community released Thursday. “This September, our goal will be to connect dots across issues, expose the consequences, and confront the complicated issues in front of us.” Since its launch in 2005, the CGI annual meeting has served as a platform for political, business and philanthropic leaders to announce new initiatives or new financial support for existing programs addressing the world’s problems. At the 2024 meeting, former First Lady Jill Biden announced $500 million in new annual spending for women’s health research, while Prince Harry outlined his plans to help children and their parents navigate cyberspace better. This year’s meeting — held once again during United Nations General Assembly week and led by Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton — will also include Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, as well as Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready, and Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee. “This year marks two decades of our community convening and responding directly to global crises.” In previous years, CGI helped organize responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CGI hopes to close those gaps with a series of “Leaders Stage Sessions,” where representatives from a wide range of organizations – including GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan, Center for Disaster Philanthropy CEO Patricia McIlreavy, AFL-CIO President, and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten -- will work together to create new initiatives. “Now is the time to stand up and roll up our sleeves — and do our part to reverse the trend lines and begin charting a brighter future,” Clinton said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump holds up the signed document after signing the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency, in the East Room of the White House, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.

Claudio Lavenia | Getty Images "Loud luxury" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out "quiet luxury" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. "We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment," Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last month. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus." The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piano have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags. "There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance," Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email. Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench. Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was "reigniting brand desire" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as "a luxury brand with broad universal appeal."

Wwd | Getty Images Gucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label. Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a "first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. "Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again." New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Venetta and the famously out-there Versace. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time," group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month. The big divide Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand.

Article: — Stetson Bennett passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns in a strong start to the preseason, leading the Los Angeles Rams to a 31-21 victory over the Cowboys on Saturday night in new Dallas head coach Brian Schottenheimer's debut. Blake Corum rushed for short TDs to cap the Rams' first two offensive drives behind Bennett, the two-time national champion at the University of Georgia attempting to secure his job as the Rams' third-string quarterback for another season. Looking much sharper than he did a year ago against the Cowboys, Bennett went 16 for 24 and hit Cody Schrader and Brennan Presley for touchdowns in the second half. Joe Milton passed for 143 yards before injuring his elbow in the fourth quarter of a solid debut with the Cowboys, throwing a touchdown pass to Rivaldo Fairweather with 8:48 to play. The Rams didn't even play second-string quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo — but Matthew Stafford, who didn't participate in training camp due to a back injury, went through a lengthy workout before the game ahead of his anticipated return to practice Monday. Schotty starts The game was the head coaching debut for the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant coach with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Although he has no intention of showing much of his offensive tendencies in the preseason to start his first year as Dallas' play-caller, Schottenheimer got right to work in the other privileges of his new job: He unsuccessfully challenged a sideline catch by the Rams' Xavier Smith on a 39-yard pass from Bennett on the game's opening drive. Offensive interference Lamb didn’t stay out of the action entirely despite being in street clothes: He got a penalty in the second quarter when an official ran into him as he strayed into the white paint on the sideline.

Article: WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country's safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. A crackdown came after an assault The catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.

Monarez said Friday that she was “heartbroken by today’s attack.” In a letter to employees on Saturday, Monarez said that “Monday will be a remote workday for all employees in order for us to conduct a security assessment before returning to the office.” “Law enforcement is still assessing damage to CDC buildings, but it is a relief to report that no CDC employees or visitors were harmed, and we are grateful for the swift response of CDC Security and local law enforcement,” she said. Asked if it was believed that the shooter targeted the CDC, Dickens said Friday the investigation is in the preliminary stages and that he could not say more about a possible motive. He referred to the suspect as “a known person that may have some interests in certain things, that I can’t reiterate right know with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.” A neighbor of the suspect, who said she knew him very well and requested anonymity, told NBC News that White had expressed anti-vaccine sentiments to her on multiple occasions.

One extreme case: Irena Green of Florida had to spend a week in jail in May after minor HOA violations snowballed into a lawsuit, then into a warrant for her arrest. In Texas last summer, at least one resident was getting brown lawn warnings from her HOA while also receiving reminders from her utility company not to exceed water limits—both of which carried potential fines. Homegrown efforts to redo lawns so they need less water also haven’t gone over well—even when local governments encourage it: A Long Island village recently tried to sue one of its residents for $2,000 after she used her town’s $350 native plants grant to re-wild her yard, which the village mayor called “hideous.” (They compromised with a 4-foot cap on the garden’s height.) Clover and moss are becoming more popular as low-maintenance grass lawn alternatives, but HOAs usually categorize them as weeds that could warrant a fine.

Changing landscape An increasing number of communities are trying to keep gas-powered leaf blowers off the streets, according to USA Today: California has a statewide ban on selling them, though many cities there take it a step further and prohibit using them at all. On the flip side, Texas and Florida have passed statewide laws to prevent gas-powered leaf blowers from being banned, ensuring your right to have an emergency back-up Ghostbuster costume this Halloween.

Article: Europe allies say Ukraine peace talks must include Kyiv 31 minutes ago Share Save Stuart Lau BBC News Share Save EPA Macron, Zelensky and Starmer held a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv in May European allies have rallied behind Ukraine in a renewed surge of support, insisting that any peace talks with Russia must include Kyiv. "The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine," said a joint statement issued by the leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland and the European Commission. Late on Saturday, a White House official said that Trump would be willing to hold a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky - but for now, it remains just the two of them, as initially requested by the Russian leader. Trump has previously suggested that he could start by meeting only with Putin, telling reporters he planned to "start off with Russia." But the US president also said that he believed "we have a shot at" organising a trilateral meeting with both Putin and Zelensky. Whether Putin would agree to this is unclear - he has refused several opportunities to hold direct talks, and the two leaders have not met face-to-face since Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago. Speaking on Friday, Trump also suggested that there "will be some swapping of territories" in order for Moscow and Kyiv to reach an agreement - to which Zelensky reacted strongly. still impose the idea of 'exchanging' Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing but more convenient positions for the Russians to resume the war," he added defiantly. CBS, the BBC's US media partner, has reported that the White House is trying to sway European allies to accept an agreement that would include Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, and keeping the Crimean Peninsula.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Sponsor Message CDC shooter identified The Georgia Bureau of Investigation named Patrick Joseph White as the shooter, but authorities haven't said whether he was killed by police or killed himself. "This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia." Kennedy reaches out to staff "We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose," Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." toggle caption Mike Stewart/AP Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a "Dear colleagues" email, and called for his resignation. Sponsor Message "Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC's workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust," said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration. Opponents say officials' rhetoric contributed Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. "When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains." A request for comment from Vought's agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the "physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers," said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. Sponsor Message Nancy Hoalst, who lives on the same street as White's family, said he seemed like a "good guy" while doing yard work and walking dogs for neighbors, but he would bring up vaccines even in unrelated conversations. "He emphatically believed that." But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: "I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC." Slain officer leaves wife and 3 kids Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and "quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism," DeKalb County said. Growing security concerns Senior CDC leadership told some staff Saturday that they would do a full security assessment following the shooting, according to a conference call recording obtained by the AP. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to "the misinformation, the disinformation" that "caused this issue." It is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted.

Article: In the first six months of the year, real (that is, inflation-adjusted) consumer spending, the main driver behind business cycles and robust economic expansion, barely grew, after rising 3 percent last year. When overall growth falls that sharply, the labor market tends to follow, which is precisely what happened: Job growth, at 35,000 per month on average between May and July, is dangerously close to stall speed. In the ’70s, stagflation was caused not by an unconstrained president but by “exogenous shocks,” meaning big, unexpected disruptions originating from events outside the country and exacerbated by the inaction of the Federal Reserve to offset them.

In announcing the list on Tuesday, the federally appointed government of the Indian-administered region called the works “secessionist literature” that were “disguised as historical or political commentary” but promoted a “culture of grievance, victimhood and terrorist heroism.” The order makes it illegal to circulate, possess or access the texts in the valley, under threat of years in prison.

Article: A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective.” By STEVE PEOPLES Associated Press , LINLEY SANDERS Associated Press , and HYOJIN YOO Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Many Democrats see their political party as “weak” or “ineffective,” according to a poll that finds considerable pessimism within Democratic ranks. Republicans are more complimentary of their party, although a small but significant share describe the GOP as “greedy” or say it is generally "bad." The poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July reveals warning signs for both major U.S. adults held a dim view of both parties, with about 4 in 10 using negative attributes, including words such as “dishonest” or “stupid." But nearly nine months after Republican Donald Trump won a second presidential term, Democrats appear to be harboring more resentment about the state of their party than do Republicans. About 15% described it using words like “weak," or “apathetic,” while an additional 10% believe it is broadly “ineffective” or "disorganized.” Only about 2 in 10 Democrats described their party positively, with roughly 1 in 10 saying it is “empathetic,” or “inclusive.” An additional 1 in 10 used more general positive descriptors. Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to describe their party positively, with many also using straightforward ideological descriptors like “conservative.” About 4 in 10 Republicans used positive attributes to characterize the GOP, making general mentions of words such as “patriotic” or “hardworking,” or offering associations with the word “freedom.” Samuel Washington, 65, of Chicago, said he typically votes Republican. About 2 in 10 Republicans said something negative about the party, including phrases such as “greedy,” “for the rich” or “corrupt.” Republican Dick Grayson, an 83-year-old veteran from Trade, Tennessee, said he is “disappointed” by his party's fealty to Trump. Among other things, he pointed to the price tag of Trump's tax-and-spend package, which will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. He said he is ready for a serious third party to emerge before the next presidential election, pointing to Elon Musk's new “America Party,” which has been slow to launch.

Article: Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine near the Cambodian border on Saturday, the Thai army said, days after the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire halting last month's deadly five-day conflict. One soldier lost a foot and two were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine while patrolling an area between Thailand's Sisaket and Cambodia's Preah Vihear provinces, the army said in a statement. The foreign ministry said Bangkok would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty, to which both are signatories, that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty. The country is a "proud state party" to the Ottawa Convention against landmines and has cleared more than 1 million mines left from decades of war, the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that Thailand's accusations risked undermining the spirit of the ceasefire. Bangkok and Phnom Penh have quarrelled for decades over undemarcated parts of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was its colony. The July 24-28 clashes, the worst fighting between the countries in more than a decade, involved exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties that killed at least 43 and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides. The fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to let observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
