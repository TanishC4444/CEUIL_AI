Article: In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan off following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on Aug. AFP via Getty Images Russian media is crowing about the choice of location for the summit -- cheering the idea that Trump and Putin will decide the fate of the war alone and that Alaska's distance from Europe underlines how European countries and Ukraine are being sidelined. Some Russian media commentators also note how Alaska was once Russian territory, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the United States for a pittance in 1867 Many observers, particularly Russian, are dismissing the meeting as a sign Trump has allowed Putin to once again deceive him. Some Russian analysts have suggested the surprise summit, in fact, is a graceful way for both Putin and Trump to sidestep the awkward issue of Trump's own deadline last week to impose the new sanctions if Russia didn't end the war. "For Trump, it's an opportunity to save face in a situation when he actually has few ways of pressuring Moscow," Farida Rustamova and Margarita Lituova, Russian journalists who closely cover the Kremlin, wrote on their Substack. "For Putin, a personal meeting would help him to maintain a relationship with Trump, who is clearly inclined to sympathize with the Russian position." Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference during his visit to Vienna, Austria, June 16, 2025. has received a signal from Russia that it may be "ready to end the war, or at least to make a first step towards a ceasefire." "This was the first such signal from them," Zelenskyy told reporters. The Wall Street Journal and others have reported Putin is now demanding Ukraine hand over the remainder of unoccupied eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in exchange for halting his offensive on two other southeastern regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But those demands would still be extreme -- Ukraine would be giving up a huge swath of territory, home to hundreds of thousands of people and important defensive strongholds, in exchange for almost nothing. Andrii Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told ABC News he believes Putin will almost certainly propose demands he knows are unacceptable so that Ukraine will alienate Trump by rejecting them.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article A Denver-based company proposing a $30 billion data center on land owned by the widow of NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt in rural Mooresville, North Carolina, will not move forward with the project, a city official and an engineer representing the company said Wednesday. “That’s the only comment I have.” Representatives for Tract, which had pitched the project as a boon for local tax revenue, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Tract spokesperson said last week in a statement to The Charlotte Observer that the company was “both disappointed and surprised” by the mayor’s previous comments indicating he no longer supported the project. When he wasn’t at the racetrack, he was an avid outdoorsman, and neighbors said he used the North Carolina property at the center of the recent battle for hunting and fishing. Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s eldest son, blasted efforts to rezone the property on social media recently, saying his father “would be livid for his name to be associated” with the project. Wednesday’s announcement makes Mooresville the latest city where developers have either backed off their plans for a data center, or had their plans for a data center voted down by local leaders amid public backlash. “We can’t just take rural residential land and destroy it forever.” Late last week, Carney, the mayor, cast doubts on the project’s prospects because Tract hadn’t said which tech company would ultimately use the facility once it was built.

Article: 13 Investigates: New Uvalde records show district limited information, teachers felt ignored UVALDE, Texas (KTRK) -- After a teenager killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one teacher told the district's superintendent, "it feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." On June 12, 2022, a Robb Elementary teacher whose classroom sustained gunshots through its windows recalled details of the attack in an email to the superintendent. I had shrapnel in my back from when he shot in my window, I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students." I told my students I loved them, I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray. Robb Elementary School teacher In an email sent 19 days after the deadly shooting, the teacher said she gave every part of herself to the school and her friends and students who died gave their lives. We were asked to be patient and understanding, so I have; but it feels as if the Rodd (sic) staff that survived, especially us in that 4th grade building are being ignored. It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." That teacher's email was among thousands of pages of emails released this week by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District and provides a peek into behind-the-scenes communications at the district in the days and weeks after the shooting. RELATED: Uvalde school district releases records for 2022 classroom shooting after legal fight over access Previously released body camera video shows Uvalde CISD police and other responding officers stood in the hallway for 77 minutes before breaching the classroom on May 24, 2022. Uvalde CISD records for the now-deceased shooter Salvador Ramos indicate he was absent for 161 days during the 2019-2020 school year and considered "at risk." Notes in his student file say he "has excessive absences and is missing a lot of work," and that he is "failing due to unsubmitted assignments." He was ranked near the end of his class as the 312th student out of 318 students. He withdrew from Uvalde High School in October 2021 for "poor academic performance" and "lack of attendance." Seven months later, Ramos crashed his car near Robb Elementary, entered with an assault rifle, went into a classroom, and within minutes fired more than 100 rounds at elementary school students and teachers. Four days after the shooting, an email from Uvalde CISD's director of student services to nearly 20 employees reminding them not to share campus safety plans with reporters or other outside sources because they are "not public information." "I watched a couple news reports last night and unfortunately there is information being reported that is not accurate. Review your plans and be refreshed on what you have in place and what deficiencies you have at your campus and how they are being addressed," the director said in an email on May 28, 2025. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, told ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." 13 Investigates reached out to Uvalde CISD and asked if the district's perception changed after more information came out about how things played out that day. "We have pledged to inform our families and the greater Uvalde school community about the release of these documents before they are made available to the media, and this notice serves to uphold that promise," the district said.

Article: President Donald Trump says homeless people in the nation’s capital will be moved far from the city as part of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia and crackdown on crime. takeover as statistics show decline in crime With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. Washington’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.” READ MORE: Why this widespread form of homelessness is often overlooked and unsupported Citing a city regulation that she said gives local police “the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments,” Leavitt said homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services.” Those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.” In the past five months, the U.S. Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed. He said the outreach would continue through the week with a “greater level of urgency.” Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.” What are people in Washington saying? Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do. WATCH: DC Mayor Bowser calls Trump takeover of DC police ‘unsettling’ Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she is more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in the city where she was born and raised. In several spots across the city, AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up tents and belongings from parks and other public spaces before more formal removal measures.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call. Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said. Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday’s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. “There’s a very good chance that we’re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I’m going to find out where we are and what we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there.” The president also said Russia will face “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war.

Article: We haven’t [had] much preparation, but you could see that football is not only about the physical aspect – it is also about the mental aspect, being in the right place, having the right tactics,” PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus. “They sat back a lot after going 2-0 up, and it is dangerous to invite PSG to come at you like that.” The Super Cup is an annual early-season match between the most recent winners of the Champions League (PSG) and Europa League (Tottenham), and it was hardly going to script when the English club took a 2-0 lead early in the second half. Defenders popped up with Spurs’ goals, with Micky van de Ven showing quick reactions to prod home the opener in the 39th minute after new PSG goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha’s shot onto the crossbar. Chevalier – playing ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced Tuesday he was leaving PSG – might have been unlucky with the first goal but was to blame for the second after failing to keep out a header from newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero in the 48th. Advertisement Tottenham is further along in its preparations for the new campaign than PSG, whose players have only just returned to training after being involved in the Club World Cup until mid-July, and looked much sharper at Stadio Friuli. PSG finished strongly, though, and hit Tottenham with late goals as Lee smashed in a low shot from the edge of the area and Ramos headed home Ousmane Dembele’s right-wing cross. Frank took over in the offseason following the firing of Ange Postecoglou, who led Tottenham to its first trophy in 17 years with a victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final in May. “I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world – maybe the best in this moment in time,” Frank told TNT Sports. It is a flip of a coin when you go into a penalty shootout.” PSG completed the Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season, also winning the Trophee des Champions in January.

Article: 9 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save Reuters The pictures from last week's sit-in protest in Parliament Square over the banned group Palestine Action were unprecedented. As demonstrators held up placards reading, "I support Palestine Action", some 522 of them were arrested on suspicion of breaking terrorism laws - more than double the total such arrests in 2024. The battle over the ban on Palestine Action (PAG) - last month, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - now feels as much a political and PR battle as a legal one. And the organisers of the campaign are trying to capitalise on perceived sympathy among some of the public by organising another demonstration in September - hoping to force the state, through numbers, to lift the ban. "I've seen police look incredibly uncomfortable with the fact that they are having to treat these elderly people as criminals," said solicitor Katie McFadden, who advised many protesters, after their arrests, last Saturday. "I've seen them in police custody and they've certainly been considerate and looked, frankly, quite shocked and horrified that this is what they were having to do as part of their job when they've signed up to go out and protect the public from dangerous criminals." The real challenge for the police and prosecutors is how many protesters do they need to charge with support of a banned terrorist organisation to send a message to the public. EPA The average age of those arrested was 54, police say, with 112 over the age of 70 So far, three people have been charged with displaying an item showing support for Palestine Action during the first demonstration on 5 July. The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had to consult the Attorney General's Office before he could go ahead with the charges because of additional safeguards in some terrorism cases. That means that Lord Hermer, the Attorney General and also a cabinet minister, or his deputy, may have to be involved in each of the files that police send to prosecutors. That, in turn, means the vast majority of the 700 may not know for months if they are going to end up on trial - in cases that could be more than a year away from a jury. Huda Ammori, Palestine Action's co-founder, has said on social media: "The system can't cope when thousands resist." EPA But ministers hope that the difference between the organisation she founded and other forms of protest over Gaza will become clear thanks to the second of the three linked legal battles soon to take centre stage. That incident prompted national security officials and the police to look at whether a terrorism ban on PAG could be justified, after having previously concluded that the vast majority of its highly disruptive activities amounted to minor criminal damage. Metropolitan Police The police set up two arrest processing points in central London to deal with the number of protesters who were arrested Documents disclosed to the BBC in the High Court show how the thinking on a ban had evolved. So when Cooper banned PAG, her decision was largely informed by what the Home Office has described as millions of pounds of criminal damage, not an assessment that it was a group of murderous militants. "There may be people who are objecting to proscription who don't know the full nature of this organisation due to court restrictions on reporting while serious prosecutions are under way but it's really important that no one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock If the ban is overturned in the High Court then hundreds of those arrested would see their cases collapse

Article: New York’s attorney general has sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case under the Trump administration FILE - Options to use the Zelle payments network are seen on a mobile banking app in New York, Dec. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) NEW YORK -- New York's attorney general on Wednesday sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case as the Trump administration was gutting the agency. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year dropped a similar case after President Donald Trump fired the agency's leader and his administration halted nearly all the bureau's work, closed its headquarters and moved to fire many of its workers. In a statement, James' office noted that its suit was filed after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned its lawsuit following a “change in the federal administration.” “No one should be left to fend for themselves after falling victim to a scam,” James said in a statement. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures.” James has been a leading antagonist of Trump, a Republican, and has sued him dozens of times. Last week, The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that the Justice Department has subpoenaed James as part of an investigation into whether she violated Trump's civil rights, according to people familiar with the matter. In one instance cited by the attorney general's office, a Zelle user got a call from someone posing as an employee of the utility company Con Edison who told the user that his electricity was going to be shut off unless he sent them money through Zelle. The user then transferred about $1,500 to a Zelle account named “Coned Billing" and then realized he had been scammed but was told by his bank that he could not get his money back, James' office said. In a statement issued through a spokesperson, Zelle called James' lawsuit “a political stunt to generate press, not progress.” “The Attorney General should focus on the hard facts, stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law, not overreach and meritless claims,” the statement said.

Article: The governor of New Mexico has declared a state of emergency in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities SANTA FE, N.M. -- The governor of New Mexico declared a state of emergency Wednesday in response to violent crime and drug trafficking across a swath of northern New Mexico, including two Native American pueblo communities. Michelle Lujan Grisham makes $750,000 available in response to calls by local governments and tribal officials in Rio Arriba County for reinforcements against violent crime as well as other crime and hardships associated with illicit drugs. The vast area stretches from the city of Española, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Santa Fe, to the Colorado state line and has long been afflicted by opioid use and high drug-overdose death rates, with homeless encampments emerging in recent years in more populated areas. “The surge in criminal activity has contributed to increased homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses, placing extraordinary strain on local governments and police departments that have requested immediate state assistance," Lujan Grisham said in a statement. In April, Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency in New Mexico’s largest city, Albuquerque, saying that a significant increase in crime in Albuquerque warrants the help of the New Mexico National Guard. The tribal governor of Santa Clara Pueblo on the edge of Española urged the state to address a growing public safety crisis stemming from the use and abuse of fentanyl and alcohol in the community at large. “But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime, and increased homelessness extend to the wider community.” In 2020, President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime.

Article: Plans to expand the oldest wildlife refuge in Texas have been scrapped in favor of President Donald Trump’s effort to “unleash American energy.” The reversal, which was announced last month, has conservationists and advocates concerned about the future of wildlife in the Texas High Plains. At the refuge, located in the small town of Muleshoe about 68 miles northwest of Lubbock, the plan aimed to protect and restore grasslands that are an essential habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Jodey Arrington and Ronny Jackson, Republicans who represent the region and called the acquisition a “land grab.” However, the Biden plan was voluntary, and the service would have worked with willing sellers to expand conservation efforts. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to reducing regulatory burdens, strengthening partnerships with state and local stakeholders, and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources,” said Justin “J” Shirley, the principal deputy director of the U.S. The refuge may have never expanded into all of those acres, it was just plotted out where they wanted to acquire land if private landowners wanted to sell it to them.” Leahy said the expansion would have brought more hunting and fishing opportunities to the area. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement to the Tribune that the service will “take no actions to acquire lands within the acquisition boundary, seek any appropriations from Congress or submit any land acquisition proposals for approval by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for any lands within the LPP expanded acquisition boundary.” Jarid Manos, founder of the Great Plains Restoration Council, said the land, water and native wildlife in the High Plains, including prairie dogs and pronghorn antelope, are clinging to survival. The Ogallala Aquifer is losing its water.” The Great Plains Restoration Council has a program that connects youth and young adults who face social and emotional stress with paid jobs related to restoration efforts.

Article: ADHD drugs have wider life benefits, study suggests 20 minutes ago Share Save Philippa Roxby Health Reporter Share Save Getty Images Drug treatment can help people newly diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to reduce their risk of substance misuse, suicidal behaviour, transport accidents and criminality, a study suggests. The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of: suicidal behaviour - 17% substance misuse - 15% transport accidents - 12% criminal behaviour - 13% When recurrent events were analysed, the researchers found ADHD medication was linked to reductions of: 15% for suicide attempts 25% for substance misuses 4% for accidental injuries 16% for transport accidents 25% for criminal behaviour "Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," said Prof Samuele Cortese, study author and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at University of Southampton. "Now we have evidence they [drugs] can reduce these risks." This could be explained by medication reducing impulsive behaviour and lack of concentration, which might reduce the risk of accidents while driving and reduce aggressive behaviour which could lead to criminality.

Article: That the mainstream press wasn’t, in his view, doing an effective job of conveying the functional racism at play in the Donald Trump-backed gerrymandering effort in Texas, which is deliberately designed to target majority-Black and majority-Latino districts. Unfortunately, we have grown to the point in this country where you can use racism against people of color, but people of color can't respond and say, ‘That’s racism.’ If we do, you’re not going to print it. Just last week, Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights-averse head of the DOJ’s civil rights division, claimed during an interview that the racist gerrymandering effort in Texas isn’t truly racist but, instead, an effort to dismantle the “racial spoils” that Democrats have purportedly reaped from laws designed to combat racist gerrymandering. Abbott essentially claimed that the GOP plan couldn’t possibly be racist, because it would create additional Hispanic-majority districts, though that obviously doesn’t preclude the maps from being racist to Black people — and it’s worth noting that the new districts were were drawn specifically to favor conservative-leaning Hispanics. During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, DeSantis said he’s entitled to further gerrymander his state’s congressional map because then-President Barack Obama and then-Attorney General Eric Holder “gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade’s census.” That’s another lie, though Obama and Holder have advocated against gerrymandering. In reality, Florida Republicans — who controlled their state’s most recent redistricting process — drew gerrymandered maps that DeSantis pressured them to gerrymander further with a proposal from his office that diluted Black voter power. Nonetheless, the governor portrayed Florida’s map as unfairly weighted in favor of minority groups and claimed “there’s some racial gerrymandering that’s still lingering that we have to correct, per a recent Florida Supreme Court decision.” Indeed, Florida’s Republican-packed Supreme Court ruled last month that DeSantis could move forward with his gerrymandering plan, but the court also acknowledged that the plan would diminish the power of Black voters. All this to say, evidence abounds that Republicans are waging a racist assault on the American voting system — even as they wage a propaganda campaign to present this push as something else entirely.

Article: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones could soon be forced to stop airing his Infowars show and give up the company's property, including everything from desks and microphones to the Infowars brand name. A state judge in Texas Wednesday ordered Infowars' assets to be turned over to a newly-appointed state receiver, who will sell them to pay the families of the Connecticut children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The move paves the way for the receiver — or sheriffs — to start the process of seizing cash and property owned by Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, within days. The families, who've spent some three years in federal bankruptcy court trying to collect what Jones owes them, could start seeing their first payouts through the state court in weeks or months. Sponsor Message "The families are pleased that the court has placed InfoWars parent company into receivership, which will finally lead to accountability for Alex Jones' monstrously cruel harassment" said Mark Bankston, one of the attorneys for the families. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble's order in Travis County, Texas district court appointing a receiver, Gregory Milligan, will also be key to whether Jones gets to keep broadcasting under his Infowars brand or has to start over in some new form. toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America Most of the Sandy Hook families still want the Infowars name and property sold to the satirical site The Onion, which vowed to turn Infowars into a parody of itself. It was a win for Jones, who argued his company should have been sold to First United American Companies, which has ties to Jones and was widely expected to keep him on air. The order adds that "any Sheriff, Constable or officer of the Peace shall assist the Receiver in carrying out his duties and exercising his powers under this Order." Sponsor Message "Now that there's a receiver in place, Alex Jones is no longer going to control the Infowars brand. "It's not a panacea, but it's a more favorable venue to be in," says Larry Ponoroff, dean and professor emeritus at Tulane Law School and a professor of legal practice at Wilmington University School of Law. The Onion did not respond to requests for comment on its plans, but the company has previously vowed to continue trying to buy Infowars to ensure "a positive outcome for the horror [the Sandy Hook families] endured." There was no immediate comment from Jones' lawyers, but Jones himself railed against the judge on his show after the hearing, accusing her of overreach, and saying her order runs afoul of federal bankruptcy court orders. But because the bankruptcy judge ruled Jones' behavior "willful and malicious," the bankruptcy will not erase Jones' debt, meaning families can keep claiming any money he makes in the future until he pays the $1.3 billion he owes them. Sponsor Message The Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his companies for defamation in Connecticut and Texas in 2018, after twenty young children and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting.

Article: Tata Consultancy Services , one of the country's biggest private sector employers, announced last month that more than 12,000 staff in mostly middle and senior management roles would be cut. "Indian IT services companies exploded over the last six months and we've gradually reduced our positions and sold all of them in our portfolio," said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex Japan equity team. And for that kind of growth, valuation and yield, it doesn't make any sense to own it in Asia-Pacific where there are opportunities to buy much cheaper companies with higher yield and growth," Duhra said. India's Nifty IT Index — which comprises 10 Indian IT companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — has plunged nearly 20% so far this year, underperforming the 22.2% surge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and the 12.16% gain in the Nasdq-100 Technology Sector Index. Not a unique problem But Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M & G Investments, said the problems arising from automation that Indian tech firms face are not unique to the country. "We expect Infosys to post 3.8% y-y USD revenue growth in FY26F (including around 40 basis from acquisitions )," he said, adding that he has a buy rating at a price target of 1,880 Indian rupees ($21.47), giving it 31.86% upside potential. Bhandari also pointed out that the company added 210 staff in its fiscal first quarter ended June, which represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of around 0.1% after accounting for attrition. Coforge is Bhandari's "preferred pick" in this segment, as he forecasts it can "easily deliver around 30% revenue growth this year — multiples of what large-caps are going to do." Of 34 analysts covering the stock, 23 give it a buy or overweight rating, four have a hold rating, while seven have a sell or underweight call, according to FactSet data.

Article: As a wary Washington waited, the White House promised a ramp-up of National Guard troops and federal officers on the streets of the nation's capital around the clock starting Wednesday, days after President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the city's police department for at least a month. The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an "authoritarian push" at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix - even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin A "significantly higher" presence of guard members was expected Wednesday night, and federal agents will be out during the day as well as at night, according to the White House. Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. She added, "It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?" Targeting a variety of infractions The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Violent crime has dropped in the district The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, "I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too." She had previously called Trump's moves "unsettling and unprecedented" while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. "It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American." ___ Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report.

Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. "I have a very rebellious character." He is the most prominent person charged under the controversial national security law which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. Reuters Lai is among the most prominent people charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city. Getty Images Apple Daily was unafraid to be openly critical of the Chinese state When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the "death knell" for the territory. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: "Mr President, please help us." For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.

Article: Hot, dry summers bring new 'firewave' risk to UK cities, scientists warn 1 hour ago Share Save Justin Rowlatt • @BBCJustinR Climate Editor Share Save Getty Images A firefighter tackling a fire in east London on Tuesday Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called "firewaves" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned. The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry. "Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable," explained Professor Rein, "it becomes much more flammable." "Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire," he added. "I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed," said Prof Rein. "And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent." Managing fire risk Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible. "We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach." BBC / Kevin Church This area of Dagenham was hit by a fire earlier this year To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment. "It allows us to target our efforts where the risk to life and property is greatest." In addition to drones, the brigade has introduced off-road vehicles capable of reaching fires in difficult terrain, such as heathland and grassland.

"Protect Ukraine from 'bluffing' Putin, Zelensky urges Trump" says the i Paper, after the Ukrainian president and other European leaders, who are not attending the meeting in Alaska, held a joint call with Trump on Wednesday to reiterate their position. The paper reported that European leaders have been worried that Trump "might be prepared to strike a deal on territory" without the input of Zelensky, and that the Wednesday meeting went some way to "calm their fears". After meeting with European leaders, the Guardian reports that Trump said he would push for a second meeting with Putin "almost immediately" if his Friday summit in Alaska goes well. The front page also features a story on foreign aid, with the paper reporting that ministers are considering "scrapping" a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid on projects that support gender equality. The Telegraph says that the meeting in Alaska will see Trump offer Putin access to "rare earth minerals" as an "incentive" to end the war in Ukraine, and that the US president is also prepared to lift sanctions on the Russia's aviation industry. The Times has similarly headlined with Trump's "warning to Putin on eve of talks", and allege the US and Russia have already discussed a "model" for ending the war that would "mirror Israel's occupation of the West Bank". "Fight house" reads the Daily Star's front page, as the paper reports Trump is planning to "host UFC fight bouts on the lawns of the White House" in 2026 to celebrate 250 years of America.

The pop superstar used the appearance to announce her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and give some updates on her life since the Eras Tour, which ran almost two years and spanned five continents before ending in December. More than 1.3 million tuned in live for the programme as Swift offered insights into her relationship with Travis, the notorious easter eggs she plants in music for fans and even titbits on her sourdough-bread-baking hobby. Teaser clips of the New Heights podcast went viral before her episode aired, including one video clip where Swift unveils a briefcase with "TS" on it and pulls out her new 12th studio album, which will be available 3 October. Poking fun at male sports fans The episode begins with a screaming introduction from Jason, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, who runs through a long list of his brother's girlfriend's accomplishments, including being the only artist to win the album of the year Grammy four times. In 2023 when the pair started dating and she started making appearances, game cameras looked for the singer in the stands - cutting to her more than a dozen times during some games. Swift was booed by NFL fans during her appearance on the jumbotron screen at the Super Bowl last February, which drew headlines and even social media posts by President Donald Trump. What the cover of her new album looks like Taylor Swift announces new album during podcast As the countdown clock ran down on her website and the podcast started, Swift's website updated with the cover of her 12th studio album. Insights into how she crafts her hidden easter eggs She also spoke about all the ways she uses easter eggs to tease her music and plant hidden clues for fans. The hidden clues are "something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason, but you'll go back and be like 'Oh my God!'" She said that her favourite example was a speech she gave when she received an honourary doctorate. "I put so many lyrical easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnights album came out, after that, the fans were like, 'The whole speech was an easter egg!'" She spoke about her love of numbers and dates. Taylor gets emotional speaking about her masters In May this year, it was announced that she had bought the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running and highly publicised battle over the ownership of her music. "I want this because it was my handwritten diary entries from my entire life." She said that her mother and brother talked with with Shamrock Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, about purchasing her music. She also thanked loyal fans for listening to her re-recorded albums, saying they reacted to the dispute over rights to her music with the Western cowboy expression, "We ride at dawn". "I think a lot of the vocals I did on the re-records were better than the original," she said, adding that she is especially fond of the remake of her 2012 album Red.

Article: Starmer sees viable chance of Russia-Ukraine ceasefire 23 minutes ago Share Save Kate Whannel Political reporter Share Save EPA Keir Starmer co-chairing a virtual meeting of the coalition of the willing There is a "viable chance" of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said, ahead of Friday's summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week Trump warned there could be "some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both", leading to fears Ukraine might have to give up some areas in order to end the bloody conflict. Addressing a virtual meeting of the European leaders following the call with Trump, Sir Keir said "any ceasefire would have to be lasting and to be lasting it would need security guarantees". The coalition is a group of mainly European countries who have pledged to provide military support to Ukraine - including potentially boots on the ground - in order to deter Russia from breaching any agreed peace deal. "Now we do have that chance, because of the work the president has put in." Vance is currently on a private family holiday in the UK, and also joined the call with Sir Keir and other European leaders on Wednesday. The vice-president said the two countries had a "beautiful alliance" and that the US had "worked with our friends from the United Kingdom to achieve great victories" over the past 100 years. "When we fight together, when we make it clear that we always approach every situation with an open hand - but if things go poorly, we're willing to do what we have to do, we make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world." EPA Vance addressed American troops stationed in the UK

Article: Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plaintiffs in the case, a group of international aid groups, did not have the legal standing to bring a lawsuit. "The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells." In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit," Warren said.

The changes, the spokesman said, showed “the agency’s commitment to protecting the rights and fair treatment of taxi drivers.” The class-action suit that prompted the payout was filed in 2006 and has been wending its way through appeals. Several drivers whose licenses were suspended, as well as the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a union that represents cabdrivers, brought the suit against the commission and the City of New York.

Article: White, whose Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, on an idyllic waterfront estate in Connecticut, gave generations of budding playwrights a chance to try out their latest works — many of which went on to success in New York and elsewhere — died at his home in Waterford, Conn., on Aug. Since its first summer conference for playwrights was held in 1965, the O’Neill, named in honor of the playwright who spent much of his life in nearby New London, has helped incubate generations of new talent, including John Guare, August Wilson and Sam Shepard, all of whom made the trek to eastern Connecticut. There, on a sprawling property that rolled down to Long Island Sound, they lived, ate and worked together, far from the pressure exerted by producers, critics, actors and everyone else who, for better or worse, shape the public presentation of a play.

Article: President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon "should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ." In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle. "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost," Mericle said. UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that "the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices," while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase , said in a note that tariffs could "add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred." Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

Article: By the end of the century, rising sea levels could push powerful seasonal waves into Easter Island’s 15 iconic moai statues, according to a new study published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. “Sea level rise is real,” said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. “It’s not a distant threat.” Paoa, who is from Easter Island — known to its Indigenous people as Rapa Nui — and his colleagues built a high-resolution “digital twin” of the island’s eastern coastline and ran computer models to simulate future wave impacts under various sea level rise scenarios. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.” Possible defenses for Ahu Tongariki range from armoring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.

Article: In a lengthy statement, Friez said that replacing Confederate-era monikers and removing statues was an attack on the “country’s heritage.” “This is a distraction from what really matters right now,” said Ebony Coleman, founder of Jumpstart Midland, an education advocacy group in Midland, adding that the school district should focus on the students’ academic outcomes. “I feel like (the board) knew that this was ultimately what they were going to do.” Stephanie Howard, the district’s superintendent, said the change could cost them as much as $62,000. Parents, alumni and former teachers who spoke on Tuesday evening said the school’s ties to Lee, commander of the Confederate states army, provoked hurt and discomfort, saying his name evoked a period of history when schools were segregated. Sue Roseberry, who in 1981 moved to West Texas from New Mexico, said her two daughters and most of her grandchildren attended the school before it was renamed in 2020. “I want you to know that you have an opportunity [to associate the school] with something that uplifts all of our students.” Barbara Hanley, who taught in the school district for 28 years before retiring, called the effort a waste of money, that “only serves to divide the community further.” “Let the old name die,” she said. Among them was Carrie McNeal, who said the board should have taken up a recommendation in 2020 to change the school's name to Legacy for Equality and Excellence, or L.E.E.
