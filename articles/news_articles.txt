Article: The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow’s uncompromising demands in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, Mark Schiefelbein, File) FILE - This combination of photos shows Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, in Moscow on May 9, 2025, and President Donald Trump in Washington on Aug. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, Mark Schiefelbein, File) The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow's uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia’s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit. The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has stood firm in his positions, agreeing to a ceasefire proposed by Trump while reaffirming the country's refusal to abandon seeking NATO membership and rejecting acknowledgment of Russia’s annexation of any of its regions. A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve: In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a “package proposal” for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian -– conditions reflecting Putin’s earliest goals. Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven't been any shifts in the Russian position. It reaffirmed Ukraine’s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance. Although Trump expressed disappointment with Putin, his agreement to meet him without Zelenskyy at the table raised worries in Ukraine and its European allies, who fear it could allow the Russian to get Trump on his side and strong-arm Ukraine into concessions. Trump said without giving details that “there'll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine as part of any peace deal that he will discuss with Putin when they meet Friday. Putin repeatedly warned Ukraine will face tougher conditions for peace if it doesn't accept Moscow's demands as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for the territories of the four annexed by Moscow still under Ukrainian control. “That is potentially a situation that gives Putin a tremendous amount of leeway as long as he can use that leverage to force the Ukrainians into a deal that they may not like and to sideline the Europeans effectively,” Sam Greene of King’s College London said. “The question is, will Trump sign up to that and will he actually have the leverage to force the Ukrainians and the Europeans to accept it?” Putin could accept a temporary truce to win Trump’s sympathy as he seeks to achieve broader goals, Greene said. “He understands that his only route to getting there runs via Trump." In a possible indication he thinks a ceasefire or peace deal could be close, Putin called the leaders of China, India, South Africa and several ex-Soviet nations in an apparent effort to inform these allies about prospective agreements. “However these conditions are worded, they amount to the same demand: Ukraine stops resisting, the West halts arms supplies, and Kyiv accepts Russia’s terms, which effectively amount to a de facto capitulation,” she posted on X. It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.” She predicted Putin might agree to meet Zelenskyy but noted the Kremlin leader would only accept such a meeting “if there is a prearranged agenda and predetermined outcomes, which remains difficult to imagine.” “The likely scenario is that this peace effort will fail once again,” she said.

Article: Iraq’s prime minister has approved disciplinary measures against senior commanders in a paramilitary force after clashes with police left three dead last month Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Baghdad on Monday, July 28, 2025. (AP Photo/Hadi Mizban) BAGHDAD -- Iraq’s prime minister approved sweeping disciplinary and legal measures against senior commanders in a paramilitary force after clashes with police at a government facility that left three people dead last month, his office said Saturday. A government-commissioned investigation found that the former director — who was implicated in corruption cases — had called in members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia to stage the attack, Sabah Al-Numan, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, said in a statement Saturday. Kataib Hezbollah is part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of mostly Shiite, Iran-backed militias that formed to fight the Islamic State extremist group as it rampaged across the country more than a decade ago. Al-Sudani approved recommendations to remove the commanders of those two brigades, refer all those involved in the raid to the judiciary, and open an investigation into “negligence in leadership and control duties” in the PMF command, it said. The relationship between the Iraqi state and the PMF has been a point of tension with the United States as Iraq attempts to balance its relations with Washington and Tehran. The Iraqi parliament is discussing legislation that would solidify the relationship between the military and the PMF, drawing objections from Washington, which considers some of the armed groups in the coalition, including Kataib Hezbollah, to be terrorist organizations.

Article: Ruben Gallego in eastern Iowa as the Arizona Democrat criticized President Donald Trump's tax bill at a town hall meeting in Davenport DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Hundreds of people cheered Sen. Ruben Gallego at a town hall meeting in eastern Iowa Saturday as the first-term Arizona Democrat assailed the massive, Republican-backed tax bill signed by President Donald Trump as likely to make “America poorer and sicker.” Gallego's upbeat event struck the opposite tone from Rep. Mike Flood's town hall meeting earlier in the week, when an even bigger crowd jeered the Nebraska Republican for most of a 90-minute event in his state to promote the bill. Democrats, searching for months after last year's election defeat for footing in opposing the aggressive tone struck by Trump in his second term in the White House, have gone on the offensive this month, still united in their frustration with Trump but suddenly energized in full-throated opposition to his signature legislation. “I think this bill is helping Democrats see clearly what’s at stake with the future of protections for so many regular Americans,” said Pete Wernimont of Waterloo, who drove 140 miles (225 kilometers) to see Gallego. “I just hope they are there when it really matters a year from now.” While some Republicans in safe Republican districts are braving crowds to sell Trump’s law, most in Congress are heeding GOP leaders' suggestion to keep lower public profiles, especially noteworthy during the August recess following closely on Trump's signing of the tax cut and spending reduction bill last month. Democratic activists are rallying to point out what they see as the measure's political liabilities for Republicans trying to hold their narrow majorities in Congress in next year's midterm elections. “This is the galvanizing moment that’s happening because Democrats now understand, we're the people that fight for the middle class and the working class of America,” Gallego told reporters before the event Saturday. “This is a clarifying moment for us.” For two hours, the audience of some 300 people applauded and at times stood cheering for the Arizona Democrat, one of several party figures who have been attacking the bill in congressional districts represented by Republicans. “I think we are getting more vocal about it, because we need to speak up.” The meeting contrasted sharply with Flood's meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Monday, when an even larger crowd of 700 voiced vigorous opposition to the bill, locking in especially on its changes to Medicaid, the federally funded health care program for low-income American. The bill, which passed with no Democratic votes in the House or Senate, makes substantial cuts to the health care program, notably by imposing work requirements for many of those receiving aid. For now, Republicans have their work cut out for them if they hope to use the measure as a reason for voters to return them to the majority in the 2026 elections. Gallego used his trip to Iowa, which included a requisite stop at the Iowa State Fair, to burnish his own profile in a state that, until 2020, traditionally had hosted the first event in the Democrats' presidential nominating process.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal ATLANTA -- A Georgia man who opened fire on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. “This is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia.” “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy said Saturday. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” Some rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a “Dear colleagues” email, and called for his resignation. “Kennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,” said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump's administration. Fired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” A request for comment from Vought’s agency wasn't returned. This shooting was the “physical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers,” said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations. “He emphatically believed that.” But Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: “I had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.” Rose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and “quickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism,” DeKalb County said. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to “the misinformation, the disinformation” that “caused this issue.” It is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted.

Article: European leaders have welcomed plans by United States President Donald Trump to hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on ending the war in Ukraine, but called for continued support for Kyiv and pressure on Moscow to achieve a just and lasting peace. The statement by France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Commission late on Saturday came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that Kyiv will not surrender land to Russia to buy peace. Trump, who has promised to end the three-year war, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties were close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. The European leaders, in their joint statement, stressed their belief that the only approach to end the war successfully required active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, as well as pressure on Russia. “We agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” they said, adding that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Advertisement The leaders said they were ready to help diplomatically and promised to maintain their “substantial military and financial support for Ukraine”. “We underline our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said, adding: “We continue to stand firmly alongside Ukraine.” Chevening talks The statement came after US Vice President JD Vance met British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and representatives of Ukraine and European allies on Saturday at Chevening House, a country mansion southeast of London, to discuss Trump’s push for peace. The Reuters news agency, quoting a European official, said European representatives had put forward a counterproposal, while the Wall Street Journal said the document included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke earlier in the day and promised to find a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine, pledging “unwavering support” for Zelenskyy while welcoming Trump’s efforts to end the fighting, according to a spokesperson for Downing Street. “Ukraine’s future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now,” he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer. Advertisement The summit in Alaska, the far-north territory which Russia sold to the US in 1867, would be the first between sitting US and Russian presidents since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021. Russian forces do not fully control all the territory in the four regions, and Russia has demanded that Ukraine pull out its troops from the parts that it still controls. Fierce fighting meanwhile continues to rage along the more than 1,000-km (620-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russian forces hold about a fifth of the country’s territory. “Not a single serviceman will agree to cede territory, to pull out troops from Ukrainian territories,” Olesia Petritska, 51, told Reuters as she gestured to hundreds of small Ukrainian flags in the Kyiv central square commemorating fallen soldiers.

Article: Los Angeles officials are pleading with residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills not to flush toilets or water lawns amid a days-long water service outage, saying it could push back repairs. On Tuesday, a valve that controls water flow into the affected communities broke, interrupting service to roughly 9,200 households just as a heatwave gripped the region, with temperatures hitting the high 90s to low 100s . Department of Water and Power issued a notice to boil water in parts of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills, advising that failing to do so “could result in stomach or intestinal illness.” Advertisement By Friday morning, many customers saw their water restored, but DWP urged even those with water in their taps to stop using it. “We are very concerned that if people continue to use the water that is coming out of their faucets today, it is going to delay the ability of the [Los Angeles Department of Water and Power] to get the line back and restored, and for your use of water to be back to normal, so that you don’t have to boil water, so that you don’t have to conserve,” L.A. (Al Seib / For The Times) Advertisement “I know after two days of not having water, when we see that water sort of start trickling into our faucets, that we think all is okay, but in fact we need to build up that pressure,” said L.A. DWP general manager Janisse Quiñones said the city wants to restore the system by 3.a.m on Monday “but that is very dependent on the pressure.” As of 1:30 pm on Saturday, a 10-million-gallon tank serving the area was about 20% full. Advertisement The tank has lost an equivalent of one million gallons during high demand periods,” Quiñones said, “the equivalent of 776,000 toilet flushes.” Some people in the afflicted neighborhoods claim not everyone is following the advisory to lay off the taps. They’re trying to fix it.” Several restaurants in the area reported on social media that they were staying open, relying on bottled water and other beverages, and outside deliveries of ice. A gusher of water spurted into the air and down a street in Granada Hills To start replacing the broken valve, DWP crews had intended to begin emptying the water from the pipe at 8 p.m. Advertisement Crews have excavated 85% of the area and have begun digging by hand around the valve to ensure adjacent oil pipelines, a fiber optic line and a gas line are not affected, Quiñones said.

Article: politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps — including some based in the United States — to check the ages of users across the pond. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software. Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can “view certain mature content.” A spokesperson for the company said r/STD — a message board focused on questions of sexual health — is restricted because of explicit images. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations “create a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.” “We absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms — but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,” Jordan said. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it’s not open to debate in trade talks. The U.K.’s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. While the “primary” focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, “dangerous stunts” and “exposure to harmful substances.” That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft’s Xbox gaming system. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it “strongly.” But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography. Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump’s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British — of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them — but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,” he said. American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws — like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores — would upend the internet closer to home. “Young people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,” wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday.

Winkler recommended canvas for storing bulkier bedding and jackets since the material is more “malleable than a standard under-the-bed plastic storage box.” But that doesn’t mean you should completely cut off plastic — clear plastic can be helpful for knowing exactly what’s inside a container, she added.

Article: That is how long it has been since England lost a match, which agonisingly came in the final of the 2022 World Cup against hosts and perennial champions New Zealand. It is a winning streak that now stretches to 27 games following a comprehensive 40-6 away victory in France, which served as England's final warm-up before the home 2025 World Cup. But this England side, bursting with physicality, confidence and a sense of destiny, chose this moment to register their biggest winning margin over the French for 30 matches, a run stretching back to 2009. That winning margin owed as much to not conceding a try as it did to scoring six, with head coach John Mitchell crediting defence coach Sarah Hunter, who captained England in the World Cup three years ago. There's been a few areas that we've looked at and we feel that if we keep looking at those we'll eventually get the transfer." This XV which started at Stade Andre et Guy Boniface in Mont-de-Marsan is likely to be very similar to the one which commences the World Cup campaign in 13 days' time against the United States at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. Kildunne was not able to add to a record of 14 tries in her last 10 Tests, but showed moments that indicate why she could be the star of the World Cup.

Article: How Kentucky bourbon went from boom to bust 8 hours ago Share Save Robin Levinson King BBC News Share Save Getty Images Bulleit Bourbon reported a more than 7% sales drop this fiscal year As American as apple pie, Kentucky bourbon was booming after the last Great Recession ended. Although the whiskey, which is traditionally made with corn and aged in charred oak barrels, has roots going all the way back to the 18th century, it wasn't until 1964 that it became an iconic piece of Americana, when Congress passed a law declaring it a "distinctive product of the United States". "You often see these kind of generational shifts where people don't want to drink what their parents drink," said Marten Lodewijks, the US president of IWSR, which collects alcoholic beverage data and provides industry analysis. "Everyone was going crazy over the bourbon market, and treating like a commodity, like a stock," recalls Robin Wynne, a general manager and beverage director for Little Sister in Toronto, Canada, who has been a bar manager for about 25 years. that's a very disproportionate response," Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze. Getty Images There are 86 distilleries in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association, and over 10 million barrels of bourbon aging These economic pressures have created a growing list of casualties.

Article: Protesters intensify pressure against Netanyahu plan to expand Gaza war Watch: The BBC's Emir Nader reports from protests against PM Netanyahu's plans for Gaza Israeli leaders have rejected criticism of its plan, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying "this will help free our hostages". Protesters, including family members of 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are still thought to be alive, fear the plan puts the lives of hostages at risk, and urged the government to secure their release. On Friday, Israel's security cabinet approved five principles to end the war that included 'taking security control' over the Gaza Strip, with the Israeli military saying it would "prepare for taking control" of Gaza City. A group representing families of the hostages said on X: "Expanding the fighting endangers the hostages and the soldiers - the people of Israel are not willing to risk them!" One protester Shakha, rallying in Jerusalem on Saturday, told the BBC: "We want the war to end because our hostages are dying there, and we need them all to be home now." "Whatever it takes to do, we need to do it. And if it needs to stop the war, we'll stop the war." Among the protesters in Jerusalem was a former soldier who told the BBC he is now refusing to serve. Max Kresch said he was a combat soldier at the beginning of the war and "has since refused." "We're over 350 soldiers who served during the war and we're refusing to continue to serve in Netanyahu's political war that endangers the hostages (and) starving innocent Palestinians in Gaza," he said. The Times of Israel reported that family members of hostages and soldiers at a protest in Tel Aviv near the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) headquarters called on other soldiers to refuse to serve in the expanded military operation to protect hostages. The mother of one of the hostages has called for a general strike in Israel, although the country's main labour union will not back it, according to the Times of Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also faced strong opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had warned the prime minister that a full occupation of Gaza was "tantamount to walking into a trap" and would endanger the living hostages. "This will help free our hostages and ensure Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future." The Israeli security cabinet's plan lists five "principles" for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing "an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority". Israel began its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: Now some are told to start over toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP via Getty Images The Trump administration is stripping protections of some asylum applicants who filed as far back as 2019. The reason, according to the letters: These asylum-seekers, many of whom entered between 2019 and 2022, did not receive a mandatory screening, known as a "credible fear" interview, at the border. didn't have enough asylum officers to do credible fear interviews for every person crossing the border, given the huge influx of border-crossers starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of the first Trump administration and during the Biden administration, experts told NPR. Sponsor Message "You're literally making documented people, again, undocumented, and they're already in here," said Michelle Marty Rivera, an immigration attorney who has dozens of clients who have received these letters. You're virtually converting people that are following the normal traditional asylum rules and leaving them without a status and without protection and asking them to show their faces to ICE." Lawyers told NPR that in some cases, their clients may have been marked for "expedited removal" when they first entered the country. When asked about the asylum application dismissals, USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said that if upon reviewing an application, USCIS discovers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection designated a person as in "expedited removal," USCIS administratively closes the application due to a lack of jurisdiction. And essentially there's a higher standard that when someone achieves that, then they can then go through the asylum process," said Morgan Bailey, a former USCIS official who served under both Trump and Biden, adding that for the last 15 years, the agency has not been able to keep up with the number of asylum-seekers who need credible fear interviews. "There aren't enough asylum officers to cover the workload, but there has also been such an increase in the number of asylum applications." But now, immigration attorneys are warning that immigrants are facing the consequences of that shortage. "The only way that he's going to be able to proceed is by showing up to ICE, telling them that he has a fear of return, and that will likely get him detained." Arno Lemus, another immigration attorney, sees this effort from the second Trump administration as an attempt to reclassify a certain set of asylum applicants who primarily came in during the Biden years. "They're just doing the process that was allotted to them that was legal and provided to them the moment that they presented themselves in the U.S.," Lemus said, noting that some of his clients have also received the letters. "And now the government's wanting to retroactively go back." Lemus agrees with USCIS that the policy is not necessarily new — the credible fear interviews are the prerequisite to filing for asylum. Sponsor Message Risk of detention is higher than in the past The Trump administration this summer unveiled a new policy requiring immigrants who entered the country illegally to be put in detention without an opportunity for release while they fight their cases. Immigration lawyers told NPR that they are concerned that their clients, who were awaiting their asylum interviews, will get detained if they report to ICE to schedule their credible fear interviews. "You go to court — you get detained; you go to your ICE appointment — you get detained; you go to work — you get detained; you apply for asylum — you were processed incorrectly," Lemus said.

Article: Misha Brown was walking into his local Circle K gas station in Austin, Texas, when he says a teenage boy approached him and asked him to buy him “Feel Free.” When Brown said no, he said he believed the boy tried to grab his wallet. When he went into the store and told the attendant about the teen, she pointed to Feel Free — an herbal drink sold in small, blue, shot-size bottles that claim to offer “relaxation, productivity and focus” — and told him that people were coming in around six times a day to purchase the product, he said in the video. Botanic Tonics, the maker of Feel Free, agreed to pay $8.75 million to settle a 2023 class action lawsuit that claimed it failed to warn consumers about the risks of kratom and because it advertised the product as a safe replacement for alcohol. Botanic Tonics said in a statement to NBC News that “false and misleading claims are being made about feel free on social media and are being perpetuated on news outlets.” “Botanic Tonics has sold over 129.7 million servings of feel free to date. We have received fewer than 1,000 consumer adverse event complaints total across all categories, with zero complaints involving severe addiction,” the statement said, adding that this represents “an exceptionally low complaint rate that contradicts sensationalized social media anecdotes being reported as representative of our customer experience.” What is kratom? Grundmann said he first got involved in kratom research in 2016 at a time when the market for kratom products was “much smaller.” He soon discovered rising demand, which he attributed to kratom’s stimulant, pain-relieving and possibly sedative effects. The FDA says that kratom is “not appropriate for use as a dietary supplement” and that there’s “inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.” It’s often used to self-treat conditions including anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder and opioid withdrawal, the agency says. Last month, the FDA recommended that the Justice Department classify 7-OH, one of the two main chemical compounds found in kratom, as an illicit substance due to its potency — a move that would restrict or prohibit access to 7-OH products. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said 7-OH should be classified as a Schedule I substance alongside drugs like heroin, ecstasy and marijuana, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Marc Swogger, an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said kratom tends not to be addictive when taken in low doses, but that people may develop a tolerance and need to take more to feel the same effects. “As an addiction medicine doctor, I would never suggest that somebody consume that [Feel Free] that’s in recovery.” (He added he also wouldn’t recommend it to anyone in general because it’s not regulated.) Mac Haddow, a senior fellow in public policy for the American Kratom Association, said, “We’re concerned about any product that has an addiction liability that is classified as causing serious adverse events.” “We strongly support very tough regulations on kratom products,” he added. “We are aware of the reports that people in the Feel Free space are reporting about addiction, as we have people in the kratom space.” Utah has banned the sale of Feel Free products. “State law prohibits the sale of any kratom product that is mixed with other ingredients in a way that alters its quality or strength to the extent that it could be harmful to consumers,” said Caroline Hargraves, the public information officer for Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food. John said he posted his videos because “I just want to try to help people and make a difference.” Brown, who posted the TikTok talking about his experience at the gas station, said he is a former drinker. “If [Feel Free] is something that’s just so easily attainable and is marketed as, like, an alcohol-free substitute or like an energy drink, I think that it’s pretty dangerous.” If you or someone you know is struggling with an alcohol, drug or other substance abuse problem, call the free and confidential helpline of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357), or visit findtreatment.gov.

Dozens of boxes of the popular Labubu toy totaling around $7,000 were stolen from a store in La Puente, California, this week, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "We worked so hard to get to this point, [only] for them just to come in and like nothing take it all away," Joanna Avendano, co-owner of One Stop Sales, told local ABC station KABC-TV on Thursday. Edward Berthelot/Getty Images, FILE Alex DePaoli, an associate teaching professor of marketing at Northeastern University's School of Business, told ABC News that part of the Labubu appeal comes from their marketed rarity and the way they are sold through a "blind box" system. "[It's a] system essentially where you don't know what's in the box, you hope that what's in the box is what you want," DePaoli said in an interview that aired Friday on "Good Morning America." "If you don't get what you want, you've got to go buy another one. A lot of folks have sort of likened that sort-of system to almost gambling." The market for Labubus has become so popular that some consumers are turning to counterfeit alternatives known as "Lafufus," which are made with lower-quality materials and may have different features than authentic Labubus.

Article: Researchers at the University of Arizona’s Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center call him Jaguar Number Four, a big cat that roamed across the United States-Mexico border through the San Rafael wildlife corridor. The sightings excited the Wild Cat Center’s team, as it showed the wildlife corridor had not yet been interrupted by the southern border wall, which partially bisects the sprawling grasslands and woodlands that ocelots, mountain lions, bobcats and, yes, even jaguars, traverse. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement However, the researchers’ fears have not completely abated, as construction on a 27 mile segment of the wall is estimated to begin in late August under the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on migrant crossings. The lawsuit challenged Noem’s authority to waive “bedrock environmental protections” to quicken construction, arguing that it would destroy the “border’s last remaining significant wildlife corridor.” “It would certainly be an existential threat to the natural recovery of jaguars north of the border,” said Russ McSpadden, a southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. So when researchers see male jaguars trekking into southern Arizona, it’s a positive sign that the ecosystem is able to support everything from “the smallest herbivores to the largest apex predators,” Malusa said. But jaguars north of the border, which could still include Jaguar Number Four, would be unable to travel to Mexico and eventually die as the last of its kind in the U.S. He popped up in the months after a shipping container border wall ordered by former governor Doug Ducey (R) was dismantled after an agreement with the Biden administration and intense criticism from environmentalists, local residents and officials. The latest detection was July 4, but because the Wild Cat Center’s volunteer researchers have to manually visit the trail cameras in oftentimes rugged terrains, researchers did not learn about it until Aug.

Article: — Their time in this small Midwestern town was nearly over, but for now, Mike Phelan still had a business to run, so he and his daughter leashed their dog and headed up the street. When they moved here from Chicago five years ago, Mike discovered Vermillion had a university, locally made bread Oprah Magazine once declared the best in the world, and an author who’d won the National Book Award. No university town should exist without a place to buy novels and new nonfiction, Mike thought, so he’d opened one and named it “Outside of a Dog” after a Groucho Marx quote — “Outside of a dog, a book is man’s best friend.” Mike twisted the key and looked down Main Street. But in the morning, his wife and son would head east with a trailer, and soon, Mike and his daughter, whom The Washington Post is not naming to protect her, would follow with a truck. For a while, the 5-year-old held her arm in the hallway and pretended it was broken, but eventually, she stopped eating and drinking at school to avoid having to go. Just nine of its 105 lawmakers are Democrats, and when Vermillion passed its policy, it became the only district in the state to explicitly allow trans girls to use the girls’ bathroom. “How evil!” Though the state’s anti-trans bills had come to dominate their life the past few years, most of the Phelans’ parenting consisted of the normal stuff — they negotiated bedtimes and dirty bedrooms, junk food intake and the best way to spend a summer. A group of customers had told Mike they were planning a “Phelan Pharewell” at a brewery on Main Street, and when Mike walked over, he expected he’d find maybe a small group. The sun fell, and no one left, but Mike knew Jen and Calvin needed to get on the road early, so he grabbed a microphone and thanked everyone for the past few years. “I’m sorry that there is an end to our time in Vermillion.” In the future, when Mike thought about Vermillion, he knew he’d always feel it had been taken from his family too soon.

Article: This screengrab shows smoke and fire rising from an industrial facility, which, according to the governor of Russia's Saratov region, was damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack, in Saratov, Russia, on August 10, 2025. So far in August, Russia's Defense Ministry has reported downing 1,117 Ukrainian drones -- an average of around 117 per day, marking a notable increase on July's daily average of 97 drones downed. July saw Russia set a new record number of aerial attacks, launching a total of 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine across the month, with a daily average of around 201 drones and six missiles per day. Since Trump announced that he would meet with Putin in Alaska on Friday, Ukrainian officials have gone on a diplomatic offensive to bolster the Western coalition in support of its peace demands. Putin, though, is demanding that Ukraine cede several regions -- not all of which are controlled by Russian troops -- in the south and east of the country, accept curbs on the size and sophistication of its military and be permanently excluded from NATO. Russia's demands, Zelenskyy has said, constitute an attempt to "partition Ukraine." Speaking from the White House on Friday, Trump suggested a settlement could include "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy swiftly rejected the proposal, saying Ukraine "will not give Russia any awards for what it has done" and that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." "Our positions were clear: a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognizing the occupation," Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's influential chief of staff, said in a Saturday statement after taking part in talks with Vice President JD Vance in the U.K. Gleb Garanich/Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk were among the European leaders to sign a joint statement expressing their support for Kyiv in any peace negotiations. "We welcome President Trump's work to stop the killing in Ukraine, end the Russian Federation's war of aggression and achieve just and lasting peace and security for Ukraine," the statement read.

Article: All over the world, as the United States retreats from the global order it created, nations are reforming their priorities, changing their institutions and, as a result, changing their identities. Canadian travel to America continues its steep decline, although that may have less to do with political resistance than with the fact that the United States has made spectacularly clear that foreigners within its borders may be subject to detention, and possibly even violence, without recourse. (There’s no replacement for bourbon.) But the second Trump administration has established a more enduring truth about the United States: It is no longer a country that keeps its agreements.

Article: In the wake of January’s horrific fires, detractors of Los Angeles — an urban reality often seen as a toxic mixture of unsustainable resource planning and structurally poor governance systems — are having a field day. Their criticism is not new: For most of the 20th century — and certainly for the last five decades or so — Los Angeles has been seen by many urbanists as less city and more cautionary tale — a smoggy expanse of subdivisions and spaghetti junctions, where ambition came with a two-hour commute. Advertisement In 1961, Jane Jacobs , the famed urban theorist and community activist, referred to “the ballet of the good city sidewalk” in her landmark 1961 book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities.” If Manhattan was her “ballet of the sidewalk,” L.A. Advertisement That vast, polycentric mass — long derided by urban experts residing in denser cities — can also be an asset in the years ahead as autonomous mobility becomes ubiquitous. Elastic, demand-driven autonomous services — which will inevitably also extend to Los Angeles airspace — can and will complement an increasingly built-out Metro light rail system and increased bus rapid transit routes, helping open up economic opportunities to those in once disadvantaged, isolated neighborhoods. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Los Angeles is even emerging as a global pioneer in rethinking the curb — often treated as an afterthought — looking at ways those stretches of sidewalk can serve new functions: a charging node, a logistics port, a civic gathering point. Rather than a singular large park like New York’s Central Park or Boston Common, the city could develop an ecological mesh, a “sponge city” capable of managing stormwater and heat while fostering public life. “No city has ever been produced by such an extraordinary mixture of geography, climate, economics, demography, mechanics and culture,” said Reyner Banham , the British architectural historian who wrote about Los Angeles a half-century ago.

Article: Members of Cal Fire, various fire agencies and tech companies learn about an autonomous Black Hawk helicopter, part of new California wildfire fighting technology, at the Silverwood Welcome Center on April 25 in Hesperia. An autonomous Sikorski Black Hawk helicopter, powered by technology from Lockheed Martin and a California-based software company called Rain, is on display on the tarmac of a logistics airport in Victorville — the word “EXPERIMENTAL” painted on its military green-black door. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change. And I think that if we look hard at what is likely coming over the decades ahead, there’s no time to waste.” Indeed, the outlook for wildfire activity in the years and decades to come is concerning. That’s largely because human-caused climate change is driving up temperatures and drying out the landscape, priming it to burn, according to Kate Dargan Marquis, a senior advisor with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation who served as California’s state fire marshal from 2007 to 2010. “It’s not really a controversial issue: Fires are going to increase in size, intensity and frequency across the western United States — probably globally in large measure — and it’s because the atmosphere is getting hotter and drier,” Dargan Marquis said. So we have to ramp up on all of those.” It wasn’t all that long ago that firefighters were using paper maps and bag phones to navigate and respond to wildfires. Today, more than 1,100 mountaintop cameras positioned across California are already using artificial intelligence to scan the landscape for the first sign of flames and prompt crews to spring into action. NASA’s Earth-observing satellites are studying landscape conditions to help better predict fires before they ignite, while a new global satellite constellation recently launched by Google is helping to detect fires faster than ever before. Much of the innovation is coming from Southern California, according to Dan Munsey, chief of the San Bernardino County Fire Protection District who also chairs the technology committee of the International Fire Chiefs Assn. We need to change the way we’re doing business.” Such changes must include a top-down reconsideration of infrastructure, budgets and training, he said, which should occur in conjunction with the launch of satellite dishes, autonomous helicopters and drones, AI-powered cameras and other new tools. As advanced as they may seem, the current tools are only scratching the surface of what’s possible, according to Kirk McKinzie, a 35-year fire service veteran who studies and consults on fire service technologies. Think augmented reality helmets that will allow firefighters to create a 3-D image of a burning building in real time — including mapping exits, locating people in need of assistance and alerting crews ahead of a smoke explosion or structure collapse with time to spare. Cost estimates for future technology are speculative and difficult to come by — its hard to say, for example, what a smart fire truck will cost in 2050 — but AI-powered rigs and autonomous helicopters will probably run fire departments millions of dollars. “The question is, how do we get there, with due digital safeguards, yet swiftly?” He painted a picture of Los Angeles as a smart city — in which electric fire and EMT aircraft zip across the sky, utility grids detect ignition sources instantly, and houses can even douse themselves in fire retardant or gel ahead of advancing flames. Robots, too, will be used to fight fire in high-risk situations — as was already done in 2019 when a firefighting robot named Colossus, developed by the firm Shark Robotics, battled flames searing through Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Indeed, much of this technology is already in development or in existence from companies such as Verizon and AT&T and technology firms such as Pivotal, ERIS, Magic Leap, Qwake and FLAIM, which are pioneering personal response aircraft, augmented reality software, heads-up displays and thermal imaging devices, among other smart tools for firefighters. One project in development from the Department of Homeland Security and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known as AUDREY, or the Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction and Synthesis, which will use AI to track fire crews as they move through an environment using head-mounted displays or mobile devices, collecting data to guide them through flames and monitor for danger. “Whether that is an expanded early response, whether it’s an early notification to citizens to preserve property and life, or an intelligent grid to inform infrastructure entities responsible for water supplies of a pending shortage, it is a multi-factor equation.” Advertisement In fact, finding water is also an issue that experts hope to soon resolve. During the Palisades fire, crews reported that scores of fire hydrants ran dry or suffered from low pressure, while a reservoir in the area sat empty as the fire burned . One group tackling this problem is Wildfire Water Solutions, a startup that brings water directly to the scene of a fire through a system of mobile pumps, pipes and tanks, saving crews valuable time that is often spent transporting water tenders and securing their own supplies. The system can deliver a continuous flow of more than 150,000 gallons of water per hour up to 50 miles away from its source, according to Chief Executive Mike Echols. “I’m not going to say anything can prevent an act of nature like that, but just think about having a continuous water supply network to disperse wherever it’s needed.” Another forward-looking firm, Frontline Wildfire Defense, has created a sprinkler system that uses fire-tracking technology to detect blazes near a home. Proposed federal legislation known as the “Fix Our Forests Act,” which is currently working its way through Congress, calls for the development of a suite of a high-tech products among its plans for managing forests and reducing wildfire threats, including AI and augmented reality tools, infrared-equipped low-Earth orbit satellites, and quantum computing applications. Meanwhile, a state assembly bill, AB 270, would direct the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to establish a pilot program to assess the viability of incorporating autonomous firefighting helicopters in the state. The agency in 2023 opened its own Office of Wildfire Technology Research and Development, which is dedicated to investigating new tools for emergency response, including ways to enhance firefighters’ situational awareness and to use AI to power drones, data collection and post-fire analyses. For years, the majority of the state’s residents and firefighting agencies have operated under an ethos that all fire is bad — ignoring Indigenous burning practices and the fact that fire has been a natural part of California’s landscape since long before humans ever arrived. “We have some challenges in front of us recognizing that there is a need for fire in many landscapes,” said Dargan Marquis, the former state fire marshal, who also spent 30 years as a firefighter and chief. In addition to advancing new firefighting technology, “how do we also, at the same time, hold in our heads and in our strategies and in our goals that fire is beneficial?” Advertisement Though much of present progress is by necessity focused on extinguishing flames, she hopes that in the years ahead, experts and technology will also find ways to incorporate as much “good fire” as possible. “We can see a pathway to moving our technology, our fire service, our social acceptance and our entire wildfire perspective through an understanding — an arc of change — where fires become manageable events and then eventually, in 50 years, we can see them as valuable opportunities,” she said. Wind is a huge factor in many fires — including the Palisades and Eaton fires — and sending autonomous aircraft in when it’s too dangerous for humans to fly is among his goals. “The thing that keeps me up at night, and gets me up in the morning, is moving faster in advancing these technologies that we have — that are already here — so that we can start moving faster towards this future,” Brodie said.

California UCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant negotiations, Newsom says Making his first public comments about how the University of California should proceed in negotiations with President Trump over grant freezes, Gov. Gavin Newsom chided deals struck by Ivy Leagues and said the university would do ‘the right thing.’ Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly of cancers, but Campbell’s work could lead to a better understanding of it, paving the way for more robust prophylactic programs — and treatment plans — that may ultimately help tame the scourge. After professor Dino Di Carlo, chair of the UCLA Samueli Bioengineering Department, learned about 20 grants were suspended there — including four in his lab worth about $1 million — he felt a profound sadness. Advertisement So Di Carlo, who is researching diagnostics for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, took to LinkedIn, where he penned a post invoking the Franz Kafka novel “The Trial.” The unsettling tale is about a man named Josef K. “Like Josef K., the people actually affected — the public, young scientists, patients waiting for better treatments and diagnostic tools — are left asking: What crime did we commit?” wrote Di Carlo. “A rapid, point-of-care test would allow individuals to receive immediate results, enabling early treatment with antibiotics when the disease is most easily addressed, significantly reducing the risk of chronic symptoms and improving health outcomes.” Advertisement Di Carlo lamented what he called “a continual assault on the scientific community” by the Trump administration, which has canceled billions of dollars in National Institutes of Health funding for universities across the country. Di Carlo said he was in meetings all week to identity which researchers are affected by the cuts, and to try to figure out, “Can we support those students?” He has also sought to determine whether some could be moved to other projects that still have funding, or be given teaching assistant positions, among other options.

Article: In 2019, when the Thai government announced plans to turn an abandoned tobacco factory in the nation’s smoggy capital into a public park, Bangkok-based landscape architect Chatchanin Sung saw an opportunity to address another of the city’s chronic problems: flooding. As a result, the city’s network of over 1,600 urban canals, which were once used for transporting goods and people but now primarily act as stormwater channels, are regularly overwhelmed. “The park project was an opportunity to absorb and clean this water.” To design the new space, a 102-acre expansion to the pre-existing Benjakitti Park, Chatchanin partnered with Kongjian Yu, a Beijing-based landscape architect who has long advocated what is known as a “sponge city” model of urban water management. The idea is that, unlike “gray” infrastructure, which is designed to flush water away as quickly as possible, cities like Bangkok can mitigate flood risk simply by making its surfaces more absorbent like a sponge, capturing stormwater before it can turn into runoff that pollutes streets and strains drainage systems. Their winning design, which was opened to the public three years ago, was realized in just 18 months and reflects the idea that such urban water management systems can also provide valuable aesthetic and recreational benefits to communities. (Sakchai Lalit / Associated Press) Fed by a nearby canal, a long system of wetlands containing thickets of aquatic plants removes pollutants from the water as it winds around the park’s perimeter, releasing what’s left into a large pond dotted with small islets. (Sakchai Lalit / Associated Press) She pointed to the pond, which no longer had the foul odor or the oily sheen of the canal despite being just a few steps away. It all comes back in the end.” The idea that cities need to adapt to — not outrun — their floods has been a lifelong preoccupation of Kongjian Yu, whose work with sponge cities has earned him the prestigious Oberlander International Landscape Architecture Prize and comparisons to Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York’s Central Park. At the time just 10 years old, Yu had been playing on the banks of his village’s river, which was more voluminous than usual due to heavy monsoon rains, when he suddenly found himself being swept away by the powerful currents. Later, Yu earned a landscape ecology degree from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design and spent two years in Los Angeles working for SWA Group before returning to China in 1997. Dismayed that the rapidly modernizing country had lined its cities with concrete dams and channelized waterways, Yu began writing to local mayors, warning of the risks of this approach and advocating instead for “rewilding natural water systems.” “Sponge cities follow three principles: retain, slow down and embrace water,” Yu said. sent to demolish Chinese infrastructure.” But things changed in 2012, when severe flooding in Beijing destroyed thousands of homes and killed 79 people, some of whom were caught off-guard in the street. “People dying in the street — that was the critical point.” The floods prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to adopt Yu’s sponge city philosophy as a national agenda in 2015. Since then, the government has pledged more than $28 billion to help fund over 33,000 sponge city projects in 90 cities, aiming to have them capture and reuse at least 70% of their rainwater by 2030. By 2020, over 40,000 sponge city projects were completed nationwide, contributing to around 3.8 trillion gallons of rainwater being recycled that year, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. Others, like a mangrove forest built on the banks of a river in the tropical southern city of Sanya on Hainan Island, act as a natural buffer against saltwater intrusion and coastal erosion from rising sea levels. “Instead of building a wall, we allow the water to come in.” Advertisement Women stop near ponds and water plants at the “Fish Tail” sponge park that’s built on a former coal ash dump site in Nanchang in north-central China’s Jiangxi province. Yu scribbled the design on a napkin during his flight to Bangkok to meet Chatchanin, keeping it simple enough to be achievable — at least in theory — with only a single excavator. It’s about combining gray and green — upgrading the current model.” Advertisement Since 2006, Singapore has been turning its own waterways and reservoirs into public parks that also absorb stormwater, an initiative known as the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme. (Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) Among the efforts to make the city spongier — and therefore less dependent on imported water — is the Safe Clean Water Program, which L.A. And although the program has recently begun to pick up pace, with around $1 billion allocated across 130 projects, Bruce Reznik, the group’s executive director and a member of the Measure W scoring committee, pointed out there are a host of challenges not present in China’s centralized model. I think we’ve got to figure out ways that we can streamline some of this stuff.” Special correspondents Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul and Xin-yun Wu contributed reporting from Bangkok and Taipei, respectively.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

All of which only makes the tragedies and disappointments of the present more onerous as we address racist politicians, crooked developers, neglected neighborhoods, the arrival of federal immigration agents — and large swaths of the region in ashes: more than 57,000 acres burned, more than 16,000 structures destroyed, livelihoods wiped out, lives lost or displaced. But the January fires come with an imperative: to think about how we want to live in Los Angeles, despite the recklessness of the past and the persistent denial of the present.

But the Trump administration, which is likely to hold steady up to and beyond the point at which Mar-a-Lago is underwater, has all but declared war on the Golden State’s good intentions, eliminating funding for key projects and challenging the state’s authority. Meanwhile, a grim analysis last year , which can’t be blamed on Trump, said the state would have to triple the pace of progress to reach its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target. As for the law requiring seismic upgrades of hospitals by 2030, as of 2023, nearly two-thirds had yet to complete the required improvements and many had asked for amendments and extensions.

Chun / Los Angeles Times) The scenario might seem improbable, but according to firefighters, architects and futurists, it’s a realistic outline of what L.A.’s fire defense could look like in 2050. Devastating fires have pummeled Southern California in the last several decades, shifting the public conversation from fire suppression to fire preparedness and mitigation as governments begrudgingly acknowledge the disasters as regular occurrences. Michael Kovac designed his home in Pacific Palisades The house is clad in fiber cement; the roof is made of fireproof TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin); the deck is made with specially treated wood for fire resistance; and a fire suppression system in the back of the house sprayed fire retardant onto the vegetation. Before fleeing the fire, Kovac loaded all his valuables into a room wrapped in concrete and equipped with a fire door capable of keeping out smoke and flames for three hours. But Kovac also installed some DIY upgrades for next to nothing, including dollar-store mesh screens on all his vents to block embers from entering — another frequent cause of fires spreading. “Now there’s a clean slate, so the neighborhood we build next will be more fire-resilient.” The front garden at Michael Kovac’s home is filled with succulents and native plants and covered in volcanic rocks instead of mulch. “You can’t knock down all of California and start new, but you can mitigate portfolio damages by making new parts of the portfolio better.” California Can fire-gutted suburbs rebuild safer? Here’s what the experts say Though no community can be made fireproof, discarding past urban design practices could make areas abutting wilderness safer from the kind of wildfire that hit Altadena and Pacific Palisades. That way, you at least have something to get back to.” Some home builders and designers are offering fire-resilient designs as demand continues to grow in the wake of the fires. Even traditional concrete, which stands up to the elements better than wood, runs roughly 20%-50% more than wood for home building, and building a fire-resistant home adds tens of thousands of dollars to the building cost, according to most experts. In addition to being a professor of architecture at the University of San Diego and a futurist, López-Pérez is the founder of Polyhaus , a home-building startup that says it can assemble a house in three days.

He hopes 2050 brings more safety precautions for his team, such as personal respirators for every firefighter and fleets of trucks that share their location in real time for better communication between departments, and he imagines fleets of drones flying alongside firefighting aircraft. He’s also optimistic about funding and said he’s never seen so much legislative interest in putting money toward fire services as he has in the wake of the January fires. The Los Angeles Fire Department is one of the few city departments poised to gain new hires under Mayor Karen Bass’ $14-billion spending plan released in April, which proposed adding 227 fire department jobs while cutting 2,700 jobs in other departments.

Article: But the future president of the United States has a far less heavenly opinion, predicting in a fiery campaign address that the “sinful” city will be destroyed by an earthquake “in divine retribution.” Days after the remarks, a massive quake devastates most of Los Angeles and many of its landmarks, including downtown’s Bonaventure Hotel, Union Station and the Santa Monica Pier. After amending the Constitution to allow him to be president for life, the commander in chief issues a directive that separates Los Angeles from the rest of the country, transforming it into a deportation center for those found “too undesirable or unfit” for the new “moral America.” Cut! Advertisement John Carpenter directed and co-wrote “Escape From L.A.” (Kyle Cassidy) Carpenter, best known for creating 1978’s “Halloween,” which launched a fresh new wave of horror movies, belongs to a legion of filmmakers who’ve put Los Angeles in their creative crosshairs, aiming their wrecking balls at its palm trees, skyscrapers and world-famous landmarks. From 1953’s “The War of the Worlds” through 1982’s “Blade Runner” and 2013’s “This Is the End,” vast areas of the city have fallen victim to a variety of calamities, including earthquakes (“Earthquake,” 1974), tornadoes (“The Day After Tomorrow,” 2004), comets (“Night of the Comet,” 1984) and underground eruptions (“Volcano,” 1997). Aliens from outer space appear to have a particular disdain for Los Angeles, as evidenced by “War of the Worlds,” “Independence Day,” “Battle: Los Angeles” and “Skyline.” In “Independence Day,” alien invaders target and destroy Los Angeles. (©20th Century Fox.) “Blade Runner” — “the official nightmare of Los Angeles,” according to filmmaker and critic Thom Andersen — depicts a dark, heavily polluted urban center with flying vehicles and residents drenched in a constant downpour of acid rain. The film’s narrator quotes the late Mike Davis, a noted historian and urbanist, when he says that Hollywood “takes a special pleasure in destroying Los Angeles — a guilty pleasure shared by most of its audience.” Advertisement Films depicting the fall of Los Angeles have long been a reliable draw for movie audiences. The movie opens with a bird’s-eye view of Los Angeles’ picturesque skylines, reservoirs and grassy hillsides before the bold-faced title appears, accompanied by ominous music courtesy of legendary composer John Williams. (Those images share an eerie similarity with some of the horrific scenes from the recent destructive wildfires that swept through Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena in January.) Los Angeles also winds up in harm’s way in “San Andreas” (2015), starring Dwayne Johnson as a top search-and-rescue helicopter pilot with the Los Angeles Fire Department. Advertisement Still, “Los Angeles Plays Itself” narrator Encke King says that “the entire world seems to be rooting for Los Angeles to slide into the Pacific or to be swallowed up by the San Andreas fault.” The documentary highlights a sequence in 1996’s “Independence Day” in which a group of revelers go to the top of the First Interstate World Center, now known as the U.S. “There’s a certain undertone of ‘good riddance’ when kooks like these are vaporized by the earth’s latest ill-mannered guests.” The famed Hollywood sign is history in the wake of a devastating series of tornadoes in “The Day After Tomorrow.” (Twentieth Century Fox) Brad Peyton, director of “San Andreas,” says the lure of these disaster films is largely driven by the city’s landmarks: “There are all these landmarks that are easily recognizable all over the world. It’s a big target for filmmakers like me who are making movies for the world to see.” Paul Malcolm, senior public programmer at the UCLA Film & Television Archive, has a different take: “Los Angeles is a city of constant change — it reinvents itself, tearing down old buildings and putting up new ones. Maybe Hollywood is processing its own anxieties about change and inflicting upon its hometown.” Advertisement In addition to the scenes that highlight spectacle and moments of heroism, some filmmakers also include more serious issues about disaster preparedness and structural shortfalls. Peyton, who is from Canada, remembers being in an underground garage somewhere in Los Angeles and thinking “this would be the worst places to be stuck if an earthquake ever hit. That thought lodged in my mind for years.” In “Volcano,” an underground volcano erupts under MacArthur Park, sending rivers of lava through the subway system and spilling out from the La Brea Tar Pits onto Wilshire Boulevard’s Museum Row. She criticizes local officials who approved an underground subway, saying: “The city is finally paying for its arrogance, building a subway under land that is seismically active.” Author and filmmaker Craig Detweiler (“Remand”) said the popularity of the “wreck L.A.” films could also be inspired by envy: “For audiences who hate California, there’s a certain schadenfreude in seeing it destroyed because of this jealousy of our wealth as well as our weather.” The popularity of such fare once inspired its own subgenre — “Los Angeles Destroys Itself” — curated by the UCLA Film & Television Archive for the Los Angeles Film Festival. The slate included 1988’s “Miracle Mile,” where the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard becomes the center of a riot, filled with residents terrified by reports of incoming nuclear missiles.

(Lorey Sebastian / 20th Century Fox) Advertisement Greg Strause, who directed “Skyline” and founded a special-effects company with his brother Colin, agrees that viewers take guilty pleasure in seeing Los Angeles landmarks ripped to shreds. “Skyline” stars Eric Balfour and Scottie Thompson as Jarrod and Elaine, a Brooklyn couple who travel to Los Angeles to help Jarrod’s friend, wealthy entrepreneur Terry (Donald Faison), celebrate his birthday. At one point during a break in the attack, a distressed Elaine, who is pregnant, says quietly, “I hate L.A.” “Skyline” was released in 2010, and even though Hollywood has not set its sights on destroying Los Angeles in the last few years, UCLA’s Malcolm would not be surprised if they made a resurgence: “There will always be an audience for those films, where we can experience safely what we always dread.”

Article: Ever since federal immigration raids ramped up across California, triggering fierce protests that prompted President Trump to deploy troops to Los Angeles, the state has emerged as the symbolic battleground of the administration’s deportation campaign. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from the Deportation Data Project , Texas reported 26,341 arrests — nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests nationally — followed by 12,982 in Florida and 8,460 in California. Advertisement Even in June, when masked federal immigration agents swept through L.A., jumping out of vehicles to snatch people from bus stops, car washes and parking lots, California saw 3,391 undocumented immigrants arrested — more than Florida, but still only about half as many as Texas. When factoring in population, California drops to 27th in the nation, with 217 arrests per million residents — about a quarter of Texas’ 864 arrests per million and less than half of a whole slew of states including Florida, Arkansas, Utah, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and Nevada. Immigration experts say it is not surprising that California — home to the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the nation and the birthplace of the Chicano movement — lags behind Republican states in the total number of arrests or arrests as a percentage of the population. Advertisement Part of the reason Republican-dominated states have higher arrest numbers — particularly when measured against population — is they have a longer history of working directly with ICE, and a stronger interest in collaboration. In red states from Texas to Mississippi, local law enforcement officers routinely cooperate with federal agents, either by taking on ICE duties through so-called 287(g) agreements or by identifying undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated and letting ICE into their jails and prisons. Indeed, data show that just 7% of ICE arrests made this year in California were made through the Criminal Alien Program , an initiative that requests that local law enforcement identify undocumented immigrants in federal, state and local prisons and jails. And other conservative states with smaller populations relied on the program even more heavily: 75% of ICE arrests in Alabama and 71% in Indiana took place via prisons and jails. “State cooperation has been an important buffer in ICE arrests and ICE operations in general for years,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Sacramento-based senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “We’ve seen that states are not only willing to cooperate with ICE, but are proactively now establishing 287(g) agreements with their local law enforcement, are naturally going to cast a wider net of enforcement in the boundaries of that state.” While California considers only some criminal offenses, such as serious felonies, significant enough to share information with ICE; Texas and Florida are more likely to report offenses that may not be as severe, such as minor traffic infractions. Much of ICE’s activity in California was hyper-focused on Greater Los Angeles: About 60% of ICE arrests in the state took place in the seven counties in and around L.A. Even if California is not seeing the largest numbers of arrests, experts say, the dramatic increase in captures stands out from other places because of the lack of official cooperation and public hostility toward immigration agents. Advertisement “A smaller increase in a place that has very little cooperation is, in a way, more significant than seeing an increase in areas that have lots and lots of cooperation,” Kocher said. “The reason is the resistance, organized resistance: the people who literally went to war with them in Paramount, in Compton, in Bell and Huntington Park,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio Los Angeles, an independent political group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps. … We’ve been able, on numerous occasions, to successfully defend the communities and drive them out of our community.” The protests prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines in June, with the stated purpose of protecting federal buildings and personnel. That’s when a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking immigration agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. But on Thursday, the Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the temporary ban on its patrols, arguing that it “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.” The order led to a significant drop in arrests across Los Angeles last month. “Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the communities and more work site enforcement,” Homan told reporters two weeks after the court blocked roving patrols. “If they really wanted to scale up and ramp up their deportations,” Ruiz Soto said, “they could go to other places, do it more more safely, more quickly and more efficiently.”

Article: For the past three months, labor unions and business groups have been locked in a protracted fight over a law, approved by the City Council in May, hiking the minimum wage for hotel employees and workers at Los Angeles International Airport to $30 per hour by 2028. Both sides, in an attempt to gain the upper hand, have proposed ballot measures that, if approved, would disrupt the city in enormous ways, leaving an impact that would go well beyond the hourly pay of housekeepers, valets and LAX skycaps. Unite Here Local 11, the politically powerful union that represents hotel and restaurant workers, is looking to put four ballot proposals before voters that, according to critics, would wreak havoc on the city’s economy. Business leaders, in turn, are under fire for filing a ballot petition to repeal the city’s $800 million business tax — a move denounced by city officials, who say it would gut funding for police and other essential services. “We’ve entered this War of the Roses because we don’t have anyone bringing the parties into a room to negotiate a balance that works for everybody, that can help sustain business and address the needs of the workers,” she said. “In the absence of that, everyone is taking matters into their own hands — and that is reckless, sloppy and dangerous.” Los Angeles City Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, pictured in 2020, said the ballot measure battle between organized labor and the business community is getting out of control. and “is in discussion with labor and business groups on a wide range of issues.” “Maybe [Rodriguez] is referring to her own lack of leadership to move her council colleagues towards a legislative outcome,” said Zach Seidl, a Bass spokesperson. City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson was more diplomatic, saying in a brief statement: “People are working hard to figure out solutions, stay tuned.” Advertisement The ballot battle began with little fanfare in May, when a group representing airlines and the hotel industry filed paperwork for a voter referendum on the $30 per hour hotel and airport minimum wage, a few weeks after it was passed by the City Council. Business leaders had argued that the minimum wage hike, along with a healthcare payment that is expected to exceed $8 per hour next year, would trigger layoffs and the closure of restaurants, hotels and airport concessions. Organizers with Unite Here Local 11, who had fought for at least two years to secure the higher wage, responded with their own package of ballot proposals, including a plan to require a citywide election on the development or expansion of large hotels, concert halls, museums, sports facilities, convention center space and — according to city leaders — some 2028 Olympic venues. Manny Morales, an employee at Flying Food Group at LAX, showed up at City Hall in May to demand a boost in the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers. Schaben/Los Angeles Times) Unite Here, which has a history of knocking on doors for its ballot measures and favored candidates, also submitted a voter petition to expand the $30 minimum wage to every worker in L.A. That effort, if approved by voters, would provide financial relief for businesses but also strip more than $800 million from the city budget, or about 10% of the general fund, which pays for police and fire protection. David Green, president of Service Employees International Union Local 721, called the move “irresponsible” and “retaliatory” — and said it would hit a city already reeling from a $1 billion budget shortfall. Advertisement At City Hall, he said, they have been effectively locked out of the conversation for years — and desperately need a way to gain “some sort of leverage” with elected officials. He warned that the plan to force hotels, sports arenas and other projects to go before voters would hurt the city’s ability to carry out “basic economic development.” He predicted that the proposed citywide minimum wage hike would drive businesses and their customers to other parts of Los Angeles County. On top of that, Thornberg said, the proposal targeting exorbitant CEO pay would likely shut down location shoots in L.A., since it would apply to companies seeking film permits on city property. “What they’re doing is clearly living up to that reputation.” Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez, pictured in 2023, is interested in a union proposal to hike the minimum wage of every Angeleno to $30 by 2028. With workers struggling to pay for food and housing and demoralized over President Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, the fight to preserve the $30 per hour tourism minimum wage has received a groundswell of public support at a bleak time, she said. is looking to feel hopeful, to win something, when everything just feels like it’s going to hell.” Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez, who championed the $30 tourism minimum wage, disagreed with the assertion that the ballot measure battle is out of control. He had a dim view of the push to repeal the tourism minimum wage, calling it “despicable.” Airline companies, working alongside the hospitality industry, poured millions of dollars into its signature drive, gathering more than 140,000 signatures within 30 days, he said. Organizers with Unite Here, as well as Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West, which represents LAX employees, led a vigorous campaign to convince voters who regretted signing the petition, saying they had been misled by signature gatherers, to withdraw their names. Unite Here Local 11 co-president Kurt Petersen, pictured at City Hall in 2023, said his union is pressing ahead with ballot proposals to hike the citywide minimum wage, restrict city approval of hotels and crack down on exorbitant CEO pay. Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., said he believes voters will reject those measures, once they learn the effect will be to “force companies to leave L.A.” The proposals from Unite Here’s leaders are less about supporting workers and more about sending a message, Waldman said.

Article: It doesn’t take an awful lot of investigating to see that we’re swimming in an ocean of waste: There are the maxed-out landfills, illegal trash dumping in the desert, choked-up rivers, strangled sea turtles and skyrocketing trash collection fees. By the time 2050 rolls around, “great swaths of California land will have become sacrifice zones contaminated with microplastics and toxic chemicals from uncontrolled dumping of organics with high levels of plastics, synthetic textile and other nonorganic contamination,” said Jan Dell, president and founder of the Laguna Beach-based nonprofit Last Beach Cleanup. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement She noted the rampant dumping that’s already happening in the Antelope Valley, and suggested that even if the state’s landmark plastic legislation is implemented in a way that legislators intended — which includes a requirement that would reduce the amount of single-use plastic sold and distributed in the state — “CalRecycle will never make [it] ... They can’t even effectively ban foam cups.” She and others, including Susan Keefe of Beyond Plastics, another nonprofit, said the plastic and packaging industries have invested too much in ramping up plastic production to allow legislation or bans to stop them. If we continue on the trajectory that we’re on, I don’t see how we’re not going to be swimming in it.” But others, including several waste experts and community organizers across the Los Angeles region, say change is afoot. There are no data or widespread evidence to back up these claims; just hope, determination and a few small-scale examples in which community-organized composting and educational outreach campaigns — with help from groups such as LA Compost and Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE — appeared to have taken hold and made local change. “By 2050 we’ll be in a completely new paradigm,” said Ryan Jackson, executive director of LA Compost — a composting advocacy organization — and former director of the city’s Department of Public Works. It feels dramatic, but from what we’ve seen up close with our organization, it’s very much possible.” Advertisement Jackson sees the shift as one driven organically by neighborhoods and communities that have had an opportunity to see how they could live differently. Members of his organization, which has worked in schools, community gardens and farmers markets from Long Beach to Calabasas, say they’ve witnessed positive shifts in behavior and attitudes when community compost hubs have been established. Chun / Los Angeles Times) “We’re looking at a future [in 2050] where we think the city will be in a much better place because RecycLA will have been in effect for 30 years,” said Victor Sanchez, the executive director of Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE. RecycLA is a 2017 Los Angeles-based recycling program, which — in a public partnership with private waste hauling companies — promotes recycling and requires the diversion of waste material from landfills on an escalating basis. closer to “zero waste” — a plan adopted by the county’s supervisors in 2022, which lays out a framework designed to reduce the use of landfills, maximize the use of natural resources and recover materials for beneficial use or reuse. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 54, which requires that product and packaging manufacturers maintain financial responsibility for their products from beginning to end — theoretically incentivizing companies to produce items that won’t contribute to a glut of waste. Despite these regulatory failures, and an acknowledgment that “capital” and corporate interests have a knack for influencing the implementation of laws and for finding loopholes in legislation — such as the time California banned plastic bags at retail stores, only to discover they’d created an exception for thicker “reusable” plastic bags, and plastic bag waste actually increased — there is reason to hope, said Sanchez. Yes, there have been some short-term failures, he said, but “that’s going to happen when you overhaul an entire system, right?” He said he has seen “beacons of hope” in his work with communities where people are “breathing the air ... Even representatives from the city’s private waste industry are hopeful — despite being on the wrong side of a lawsuit suggesting many of them are delivering unpermitted waste to the Antelope Valley. District Court in Los Angeles by Antelope Valley residents claims that waste-hauling companies including Athens Services and California Waste Services are dumping hazardous substances without authorization, which the companies deny. Athens noted that the law encourages the distribution of compostable material to “farmers and other property owners for beneficial use.” Jessica Aldridge, director of sustainability and zero waste services at Athens Services, an L.A.-based waste hauling company, was not in a position to answer questions about the lawsuit, but said her company is optimistic about what “the environmental community, social justice and waste communities are trying to achieve.” She agreed with Sanchez that while there may be some temporary political and regulatory setbacks, California lawmakers “have a positive goal in mind, and they’re setting up the regulations and the infrastructure” in pursuit of a cleaner environment and a more circular economy. But Keefe, the Beyond Plastics advocate, says all this hope for circular economy laws and small community action is misplaced, that we’re not going to make a dent in waste generation as long as single-use plastic manufacturers produce and sell their products.

The sycamore — now bearing the name El Aliso — appears as a towering black splotch in the first known photo of Los Angeles, shot in the early 1860s when the city was in the process of turning from a Mexican village into an American town. When El Aliso was finally chopped down in 1895, felled by brewery owners who inadvertently killed the giant after cutting off too many limbs and paving over its roots, residents took chips from it as a memento mori of sorts. In 2019, members of the Kizh-Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians were present as representatives from the city of Los Angeles laid a bronze plaque on the sidewalk at the northeast corner of Commercial and Vignes streets — in the shadow of what was then a different strip club — to commemorate El Aliso. “While its physical presence is gone,” the plaque stated, “the oral history handed down through the generations has kept its beauty and story alive in the Kizh people.” Voices Arellano: ‘La migra, la migra’: Inside Huntington Park’s long deportation summer Businesses aren’t open or have signs stating that walk-ins aren’t welcome. But when I finally figured out where the plaque was supposed to be, I found a shallow slot strewn with trash and the remnants of the adhesive that once kept the plaque in its place.

Article: Times readers: “Thinking ahead to 2050, how might you reconfigure the city so it is a sustainable home for everyone?” Here is a sampling of their comments: Use the Chicago riverfront, apartments, architecture, etc., as your example. The roof is made of fireproof TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin), the deck is made with specially treated wood for fire resistance and a fire suppression system in the back of the house sprayed fire retardant onto the vegetation. One estima te is that in the United States, one in four new homes are built in areas prone to wildfires and an estimated 95% of wildfires in California are “man-made.” This existential question has largely been unaddressed in the past 25 years, especially as the region has stuck to its formula of growing communities further outwards. Chun / Los Angeles Times) To transform Los Angeles into a sustainable and equitable city by 2050, we need a holistic approach that addresses climate challenges while fostering community well-being. Adapted housing and support systems will ensure no one lives on the streets, and public spaces will be accessible and inclusive Could AI robots pick up all our trash in the future? Fighting constantly for better public transit is the easy answer as we see Metro working in new projects, but there also has to be a hyper-local push toward smart density, advocating for more walkable neighborhoods, fewer single-family housing developments, and completely redesigning towns and cities so folks can access what they need without needing to drive everywhere. A lot of that is hard, small work you see on a neighborhood scale, but there’s one big project I’d like to see: burying the 101 and building a linear park in the Cahuenga Pass.

Article: Over the last century, Southern California has grown and thrived by accessing water from faraway sources including the Colorado River, the Eastern Sierra’s streams and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. According to state projections, the average amount of water delivered from the Delta to Southern California could decrease by between 13% and 23% within two decades unless measures are taken to ameliorate those declines. Those who lead the region’s large water agencies say they are seeking to line up a diversified mix of sources by recycling wastewater, capturing stormwater, restoring watersheds, possibly building new water-transport infrastructure, and even tapping the Pacific Ocean. “We need to find a way to be sustainable at the same time that water remains affordable,” said Adán Ortega Jr., board chair of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Ortega said the various investments the district is now considering should lay the foundation for a “new and endless river.’’ Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Pure Water Southern California is projected to cost $8 billion and produce up to 150 million gallons of drinking water daily by purifying treated effluent that is now discharged into the ocean. MWD’s plans for the Carson facility call for initially using the recycled water for outdoor irrigation and to recharge groundwater basins, where it would be stored and then pumped out for use. But if we check all those boxes and give ourselves the time to do it, a hundred years from now, people will take it for granted as a source of water.” The need to innovate is evidenced by the recent history of the L.A. A severe shortage of supplies from Northern California in 2022 prompted the Metropolitan Water District to order emergency water restrictions for nearly 7 million people in areas that rely heavily on deliveries from the State Water Project. “People were understandably very upset in terms of the impact on their gardens and landscaping,” said Kristine McCaffrey, general manager of Calleguas Municipal Water District, which delivers water for about 650,000 people in Ventura County. “That’s why we’re working very hard to make sure that we don’t ever encounter this kind of situation again.” The water restrictions were lifted in 2023 when a series of atmospheric river storms brought relief to the state. It is awaiting studies of a company’s proposal to anchor a “farm” of 40-foot-long devices to the ocean floor several miles off the coast of Malibu, which would pump purified freshwater to shore in a pipeline. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) In the next several years, managers of water agencies will study the costs of this and other projects to determine which mix of options will deliver greater reliability while keeping costs in check and preventing steep rate hikes. Lessons from Cape Town Cape Town was particularly vulnerable to the region’s worst drought in centuries because of its heavy reliance on rainwater stored in reservoirs for 98% of its supply, according to Michael Webster, who was the city’s executive director for water and sanitation from 2018 to 2023, and who now works for the World Bank. “The key strategy in overcoming it is to build in some diversification of supply — to groundwater, desalinated water and reused wastewater — in addition to reducing demand.” World & Nation Global Development: How Cape Town found water savings California never dreamed of A six-car municipal police convoy skidded to a halt outside a Cape Town house, and police leaped from their cars at the offending sight: a trickle of hose water splashing onto a squat red flower. Advertisement He said one lesson is to examine future scenarios and rigorously plan around the question of, “What is needed now to avoid a crisis in 10, 20, 30 years’ time?” “In the middle of the Cape Town crisis, you couldn’t build a desal plant. “That a crisis is coming, and it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.” The MWD’s 38-member board of directors recently adopted a blueprint for adapting to climate change. The strategy, part of an effort called the Climate Adaptation Master Plan for Water , assesses potential risks, sets goals for lining up additional water supplies, and outlines criteria for evaluating options. “We can plan within this range of possible needs in the future, and then we can make incremental decisions based on real-world conditions,” said Liz Crosson, MWD’s chief sustainability, resilience and innovation officer. “That really helps prevent us from overbuilding, but it also helps us be super prepared.” Advertisement The plan sets targets including identifying 300,000 acre-feet of additional water supplies per year by 2035 — an amount equivalent to nearly 9% of the region’s average water use over the past decade. A search for new sources There are ongoing public debates over how much to invest in local water sources versus how much to spend on infrastructure to store and transport water from other parts of the state. MWD board members will consider whether to invest in the state’s plan to build Sites Reservoir northwest of Sacramento, and in the Newsom administration’s proposal to build the Delta Conveyance Project (DCP), a water tunnel beneath the Delta with an estimated price tag of $20.1 billion. The proposed Delta tunnel has garnered support from managers of Southern California water agencies, who say it promises to improve the reliability of water deliveries from the State Water Project. Craig Miller, general manager of Western Municipal Water District, says the project “is the backbone of California’s economy” and that investing in modernizing it “ensures we can adapt to a changing climate, protect jobs and the environment, preserve lifestyles, and keep California economically competitive.” Advertisement Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that the project is crucial to the state’s future, and that California‘s existing water system “was designed for a world that no longer exists.” The project is strongly opposed, however, by environmental advocates and the Delta’s political leaders, who say building the 45-mile tunnel would harm the region’s farmlands and communities, and threaten the estuary’s ecosystem and fish species. Christopher Cabaldon (D-West Sacramento) has pointed to the high costs, saying “the real threat here is to the pocketbooks, the monthly water bills, of residents throughout Southern California.” Those who are urging the MWD’s leaders to reject the tunnel plan include Bruce Reznik, executive director of the group Los Angeles Waterkeeper, who says the project would undermine ongoing efforts to prioritize local options. And so things absolutely have to change.” Instead of supporting the tunnel, he said, the region should redouble efforts on conservation and more efficient water use, while investing in recycling wastewater, capturing stormwater and cleaning up contaminated groundwater. Advertisement Supporters of nature-based solutions have called for larger efforts to restore parts of the Los Angeles River’s watershed by removing concrete and asphalt where feasible, reactivating portions of the floodplains that will capture runoff and allow water to percolate underground to replenish the aquifer. These types of projects, intended to restore water’s natural paths in cities, have been called “urban acupuncture” or “sponge cities.” Los Angeles and nearby cities were built on the famous words that William Mulholland, L.A.’s chief water engineer, declared in 1913 as water from the Owens Valley began flowing into a reservoir : “There it is. And it literally does, as it leaps three thousand feet across the Tehachapi Mountains in gigantic siphons to slake the thirst of Los Angeles.” But now, Reznik said, the current realities call for a different sort of water ethic based on becoming resilient through better use of the area’s resources. “Let’s prioritize our investments where they’re going to do the most good, and that’s in resilient local water supplies.” In addition to weighing costs and benefits in dollars, Southern California’s water policymakers are expected to consider the environmental effects of different options, which are often more complicated to assess. For example, diversions of water to supply farms and cities have contributed to the ecological deterioration of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where native fish species have suffered major declines. And because pumping water — including pushing supplies in pipelines up and over the Tehachapi Mountains — is energy intensive, conservation and other local approaches that require less pumping would also help save energy and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. More water-saving potential Researchers at the Pacific Institute, a water think tank in Oakland, have examined the potential for California to use water more efficiently by making improvements such as fixing leaks in pipes, replacing inefficient washing machines and toilets, and replacing thirsty lawns with plants suited to the state’s Mediterranean climate. These potential savings, both inside and outside homes and businesses, far surpass the targets in the MWD’s climate adaptation strategy, said Heather Cooley, the Pacific Institute’s chief research and program officer. She and her colleagues estimated that the South Coast region, which includes MWD’s territory, could save between 1.1 million and 1.7 million acre-feet of water per year by making various efficiency improvements indoors and outdoors. However, they are the cheapest, fastest way to meet our water needs.” As one example, Southern California is expected to save a substantial amount of water in the coming years through a measure state legislators passed in 2023 outlawing the use of drinking water for “nonfunctional” turf — the sort of grass that fills spaces along roads and sidewalks, in front of businesses, and around parking lots. “There is a lot more they can do, and will have to do, as those imported supplies become even more variable and uncertain.” Since 2015, roughly half of Southern California’s water supplies in MWD’s territory have come from imported sources, including Northern California, the Colorado River and the Eastern Sierra, and the remainder has come from local sources including groundwater and recycled water. Anticipating uncertainty The MWD’s climate plan says a key goal is planning for “deep uncertainty.” “We need to be prepared for something that has never been experienced in the period of record, and potentially for several centuries or even millennia,” said John Matthews, executive director and co-founder of the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation. Already, scientists have found that the last 25 years have probably been the driest quarter-century in western North America in 1,200 years, and that climate change is a major contributor. The river’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are now about two-thirds empty, and representatives of California and other states are under pressure to negotiate a deal to take less water from the river. “This is going to be an expensive, multi-decade and complicated process, and it’s going to require really big changes.” He said it’s crucial to remember that Southern California is so highly developed and rich today thanks to the region’s big investments in water in the early 20th century, including the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Colorado River Aqueduct. “They built the state economy around one climate, and now they are moving into a very different kind of climate, and they need to go back and invest into the climate that they’re headed towards,” Matthews said. Advertisement Although federal and state funds in recent years have helped to partially support some water infrastructure projects, such as initial work on the Carson wastewater recycling project, the bulk of the costs are expected to be borne by local agencies and ratepayers. He said the struggles of Mexico City, where water service has recently become intermittent for millions of people , is a scenario that Southern California must plan carefully to avoid.

Article: As Ross received a stream of texts urging her to evacuate, school administrators, calm and collected, repeated the same phrase: “This is the safest place to be.” For many, the idea of hunkering down in a fire shelter for hours on end as flames enclose on all sides is hard to stomach. Fire researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology — a federal science lab tasked with developing science-based standards, including for fire safety — visited Paradise in Northern California 11 times after the 2018 Camp fire and interviewed more than 150 first responders, local officials and residents. Chun/Los Angeles Times) So, in an NIST report published in March , Eric Link and Alexander Maranghides, two NIST fire protection engineers, argue that emergency planners need to face the reality that in these dire evacuation scenarios, they have no choice but to use fire refuges — which means fire experts ought to develop standards for them that are designed to keep people alive. They proposed three types of fire refuges within high-risk communities: Temporary fire refuge areas — parking lots, sports fields or open spaces with good brush clearance — would provide residents with some short-term protection in the worst scenarios but are still not truly safe. To deem a building worthy of “fire shelter” status, it must resist all of fire’s assaults: Its searing radiant heat that extends far beyond the flames, the falling embers capable of sneaking into any cracks to ignite whatever is inside, and the flames themselves. As NIST and other groups accumulate evidence, it’s up to the scientific community to determine when the research is conclusive and create official standards through organizations such as the National Fire Protection Assn. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement One research group looking at satellite data found that wildfires in California are now growing in size four times faster than they were at the start of the century. Meanwhile, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has identified more than 2,200 communities in high fire-risk areas with at least 30 residences and only a single escape route. Without comprehensive guidelines on fire shelters, hospitals, senior living facilities and schools such as Pepperdine have struck deals with their local fire departments: The organizations house people in fire-resistant buildings. The senior director of Pepperdine’s Office of Emergency Services and Office of Insurance and Risk, Jon Weber, said that it’s impossible to guarantee safety with 100% certainty in any scenario, but that the university has gone to exacting lengths to make sheltering at their Malibu campus the safest option for students. In one video , a loud but gentle voice called out: “Please move inward as promptly and calmly as possible, please.” School officials continued to repeat that the library was the safest place to be. The reality was they were in the safest place they could possibly be.” Advertisement An Orange County fire helicopter lifts off with a load of water from a pond at Pepperdine University while fighting the Franklin fire in Malibu on Dec. The protocol got its first real test in the 1993 Old Topanga fire, and subsequently in the Malibu-Calabasas fire in 1996, the Canyon and Corral fires in 2007 and Woolsey in 2018. Ross, like the rest of those who were sheltering, walked out unscathed — though her boyfriend was quick to note she smelled as if she had just smoked 10 cigarettes. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Advertisement California has pushed to exclude fire-prone areas from laws designed to fast-track development amid the nation’s housing crisis, and many local governments have made it their official policy to avoid adding any density to fire-prone, hard-to-evacuate areas. Yet for the many communities in the state’s fire-stricken wildlands — from the foothills of the Sierra to Malibu’s coastal canyons — building new fire shelters may be essential to survival.

Article: When the fires this year upended Los Angeles and put into question what it even means to return to normal, I was reminded of a chapter in “California Against the Sea” that had expanded my own understanding of what it takes to truly adapt our built environment — and to reimagine the places that we have come to love and call home. This chapter, which opens with a radical shoreline reconfiguration just north of San Francisco, came not without controversy, but it provided a glimpse into what compromise might need to look like for so many communities struggling to keep up with climate change. Here along the foggy bluffs of the Sonoma coast, the edge of the continent feels more like the edge of the world — a window into the future if California does not change course. These wave-cut cliffs, a brittle mélange of ancient claystone and shale, have been eroding on average about a foot a year, exacerbated since the 1980s by a hardened shoreline, intensifying El Niños and, now, sea level rise. (Carolyn Cole/ Los Angeles Times) So, with every storm and every knock from the ocean, officials have scrambled to save the highway, pouring millions of tax dollars into a vicious cycle of sudden collapses and emergency repairs. Advertisement “This is what unmanaged retreat looks like, and it is quite frankly a hot mess of septic systems, old house parts and armoring that have fallen into the intertidal zone with no real mechanism for cleaning it up,” Sonoma County supervisor Lynda Hopkins declared. “If we don’t start planning ahead and taking proactive measures, Mother Nature will make the decisions for us.” With the realities of climate change looming ever closer, California transportation officials agreed it was time to try something different: make peace with the sea and move the crumbling highway more than 350 feet inland. They knew nailing down the details would be fraught, but, if done right, this would be the first radical effort by the state to plan for a reimagined coast — a coast that could support California into the next century. It was the rare managed retreat proposal that intentionally sought to both raise and relocate critical infrastructure far enough from the shore to make room for the next 100 years of rising water. Officials studied more than 20 alternatives that tried to balance safety codes, traffic needs, fragile habitats, public access to the coast and other competing requirements that were tricky to meet given the topography. At its heart this project, like so many attempts along the California coast, called for a reckoning over what was worth saving — and what was worth sacrificing — and whether it was possible to redesign a treasured landscape so that it survives into the future. Book cover for “California Against the Sea” by Rosanna Xia (Heyday Books) “It seems daunting; it’s a lot of change to cope with, but it’s also an opportunity for communities to think about, ‘What are the coastal resources we want to have access to fifty, one hundred years from now?’” said Tami Grove, who oversees transportation projects for the California Coastal Commission and spent years reconciling all the emotional meetings, the disagreements, the many stops and stalls and hand-wringing compromises. “It gets lost, sometimes, when people are worried about everything that we’re going to lose to sea level rise — but there are things that we’re going to be able to choose and enhance and design into the future if we start planning now.” In what many described as a major coup in government bureaucracy, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the coastal commission and county leaders set aside their differences to come up with a new solution together. By November 2020, they had hammered out a plan to relocate almost one mile of the highway — most notably with a new 850-foot-long bridge spanning Scotty Creek, a degraded stream that, choked for decades by the highway’s current configuration, rarely reached the ocean anymore. The concrete bridge (a monstrous overpass or a reasonable compromise, depending on who’s talking) will at least allow Scotty Creek to flow freely into the ocean again — making room for more red-legged frogs, Myrtle’s silverspot butterflies, and the passage of steelhead trout and coho salmon. This all came as a shock at first for Philip and Roberta Ballard, who own and live on the ranch, but they said they’ve come to understand the necessity of this project. The bridge still feels way too big — especially for this rural stretch of paradise that first captured their hearts more than two decades ago — but after years of meetings, questions and debating each trade-off, the retired couple decided to turn their energies toward making sure Scotty Creek got restored as part of the deal. “We’ve arrived at feeling reasonably good about getting the best mitigation we can get for this region and getting something reasonably positive out of it.” Construction crews work on building a new bridge over Scotty Creek, as part of Caltrans’ Gleason Beach Roadway Realignment Project. (John Huseby / Caltrans) When we don’t understand and don’t allow for the ocean’s ways, we end up with homes perched on crumbling cliffs and seawalls still making a stand. Guided by a few mere decades of history and a narrow understanding of the California shore, many today know only how to preserve the version of the coast they learned to love. Advertisement Stefan Galvez-Abadia, Caltrans’s district division chief of environmental planning and engineering, is now attempting with his team to design a prettier bridge at Gleason Beach, one more fitting for the rural landscape. They’ve conducted surveys on what color to paint the bridge — some shade of gray or brown, for example, or a more distinct hue like that of the Golden Gate Bridge. Donne Brownsey, who served as vice chair of the Coastal Commission at the time, remarked that the project reminded her of a concrete beam bridge in Mendocino County that spans the mouth of the Ten Mile River, just north of where she lives in Fort Bragg. “It was a new bridge, it caused a lot of consternation, but I didn’t know that the first few times I went over it — I would look forward to that part of the drive, because I could see the whole estuary to the west, and I could see the rivershed to the east,” she said. “You don’t even really see the bridge anymore because the swallows now all nest there, and it’s just part of nature.” The bridge at Gleason Beach, facing similar design constraints as the Ten Mile Bridge, also has to be massive — a counter-intuitive twist to what one might think it means to accommodate the environment. Engineers had at first tried more minimal options — a shorter bridge, thinner columns, a less intrusive height — but many were not large enough in size or distance to outlast the coastal erosion projected for the next 100 years. (Caltrans) Despite so many years of seminars and talks about climate change adaptation, turning an abstract concept like managed retreat into reality has been a delicate exercise in compromise, Galvez-Abadia said. These are the difficult decisions that we will all have to make as a region, as a community, for generations to come.” As he filed away his notes and prepared to break ground, he reflected once more on all the years it took to reach this first milestone. If the native plants reemerge, the salmon return, and there still remains a coast that families could safely access and enjoy, perhaps this new highway — however bold, however different — could show California that it is possible, that it isn’t absurd, to build toward a future where nature and modern human needs could finally coexist.

Article: The Los Angeles we know has long been an irresistible subject for novelists and moviemakers — so much so that they’ve often tortured reality to make it conform to their imagination. Robert Towne mined the history of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in his screenplay for “Chinatown” but moved the story ahead up by some two decades, from 1913 to the 1930s, to give his scenario its noir sensibility. Ridley Scott and his filmmaking team depicted a future Los Angeles beset with darkness and a never-ending downpour of rain for “Blade Runner” — never mind that its source material, Philip K. The tone of nonfiction conjectures about the future of Los Angeles generally fall into two categories, elegiac or apocalyptic — and sometimes both: “utopia or dystopia,” in the words of Davis. It was his follow-up, “Ecology of Fear” (1998), that really attempted to sketch out a future for the city, based on his vision of “the great unbroken plains of aging bungalows, stucco apartments, and ranch-style homes — as it erodes socially and physically into the twenty-first century.” Davis drew a line from what he saw as “the current obsession with personal safety and social insulation ... in the face of intractable urban poverty and homelessness, and despite one of the greatest expansions in American business history” in the mid-1990s to explain “why fear eats the soul of Los Angeles.” Mike Davis in his San Diego home in 2022.

The Slovenian transplant Louis Adamic, who had emigrated to the United States in 1913 and settled in the port community of San Pedro, scrutinized Southern California with pitiless objectivity in a 1930 essay titled “Los Angeles! There she blows!” Culture Monster Blog Reading L.A.: Louis Adamic and Morrow Mayo This article was originally on a blog post platform and may be missing photos, graphics or links. Adamic mentioned the conviction among Angelenos that their city “will ultimately — perhaps within the next three or four decades — be the biggest city in the world.” And he acknowledged that “the place has many great advantages, among the foremost, of course, being Climate, and but a single drawback, which, however, is an extremely serious one — that of water shortage.” Nevertheless, noting that the city’s population had doubled over the previous 10 years to nearly 2 million, he confidently predicted that it would number 3 million by 1935. Another writer who extrapolated from what he saw of the Los Angeles of his time was Morrow Mayo, whose 1933 book “Los Angeles” is quoted elsewhere in The Times’ Future of L.A. Mayo expressed the opinion that even if “the territory known as the ‘City of Los Angeles’” grew from its then-population of 1.2 million to 4 million or more, he doubted that “it will ever be permanently the great vibrant, vital, nerve-center of the Pacific coast.” Advertisement The reason, Mayo wrote, was its climate — “meant for slow-pulsing life; a climate where man, when he gets adjusted to the environment, takes his siesta in the middle of the day. Carey McWilliams wrote that the aircraft industry was “likely to remain in the region and even to expand production,” but Boeing’s military aircraft assembly line was shut down in 2015, ending an era. After a few generations under the sun, Mayo concluded, “it will settle back to normalcy, and become in tune with nature, for man has never yet failed to adjust himself to the climate in which he lives.” Thus did Mayo pioneer the stereotype of the laid-back Angeleno with barely a care in the world. On the other hand, Mayo quoted a fellow prognosticator as finding in the city’s industrial districts “that same peculiarly contented type of workman, the same love of little homes ‘across the street from the factory,’ the diligence and care for the flowers in the front yard, or the fruit trees and vegetables in the rear, a total lack of the Bohemian spirit, the love of a comfortable, humble existence,” that could be seen in Philadelphia. ‘Los Angeles — the Philadelphia of the West.’” Advertisement Such miscalculations point to another pitfall facing those who would dare to predict the future of Los Angeles: Change has come so rapidly that any prediction can be confounded within the lifetime of its author. Thus Carey McWilliams, that indefatigable chronicler of the California pageant, wrote in his book “Southern California Country: An Island on the Land” that the aircraft industry was “likely to remain in the region and even to expand production.” McWillliams wrote those words in 1946; by 1980, when he died, the industry had crashed in Southern California, entering a long period of retrenchment that ended with Boeing’s closing of the region’s last commercial aircraft manufacturing plant in 2005. The Long Beach plant’s 300 workers were transferred to Boeing’s military aircraft assembly line, but that was shut down in 2015, ending an era, as The Times observed, in which the region was. “once synonymous with the manufacture of aircraft.” The trajectory of the Los Angeles ecology, and by extension that of Southern California and the entire state of California, was the subject of Reisner’s 1986 book, “Cadillac Desert.” He viewed the water politics of the region, quite properly, through the prism of winner-take-all economics. Department of Water and Power) “The West’s real crisis is one of inertia, of will, and of myth,” he wrote in the closing pages of “Cadillac Desert.” Reisner looked ahead, hopefully, to a West that “might import a lot more meat and dairy products from states where they are raised on rain, rather than dream of importing those states’ rain .... A region where people begin to recognize that water left in rivers can be worth a lot more — in revenues, in jobs — than water taken out of the rivers.” “At some point, perhaps within my lifetime, the American West will go back to the future than forward to the past.” Advertisement Regrettably, Reisner, who died in 2000, didn’t live to see that happen. In his 1998 book “Paradise Lost,” Schrag sought not simply to foretell the region’s future, but to explicate how its future foretold what was in store for the country as a whole. it is at the forefront of the world’s leading-edge technologies and of its creative energy.” (He was right about that, at least up to this moment.) Surfers enjoy a day at Venice Beach. (Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times) But Schrag also pointed to the state’s “increasingly dysfunctional governmental and fiscal public institutions, the depleted state of its public infrastructure, services, and amenities, the growing gaps between its affluent and its poorer residents, and its pinched social ethos,” which “hang like dark clouds in the sunny skies.” California had exported to other states the facile low-tax policies of Howard Jarvis and Ronald Reagan’s view of government as “the problem, not the solution.” Advertisement In addition, Schrag saw that the emergence of social media “may insure against the power of Big Brother to dominate communications, but they also amplify the power of shared ignorance .... What used to be limited to gossip over the back fence is now spread in milliseconds.” And he foresaw how the changing demographics of California would be replicated nationwide: “The new kids now crowding into the schools and universities of California — black, brown, Asian — will constitute the majority of the state’s workforce, and a good part of the nation’s, in the next decade, and forever after,” he wrote. Schrag had his finger on an essential truth about Los Angeles and California that remains true to this day: They’re the subject of unending curiosity for readers of history and current affairs no less than for consumers of novels and movies. Kevin Starr wrote: “In recent times, the American people have turned to California and asked it to create a technology revolution, and California responded.” (Bloomberg via Getty Images) Kevin Starr, writing in 1995, understood how that impulse would play out in the decades to come. “The United States is testing its future through California,” he said in an essay for the website of the California State Library, which he served as state librarian from 1994 to 2004. The American people have turned to California for new models of lifestyle, new ways of enjoying and celebrating the gift of life, and California responded with an outpouring of architecture, landscaping, entertainment, sport and recreation.” The confidence that Starr projected 20 years ago may have faded, and may fade further in the future in Los Angeles and up and down the state.

Article: Visitors made shadow puppets for AI to identify, used AI to generate songs, asked chatbots questions and faced off with AI in a game in which players tried to draw images that only humans would recognize. “It sort of breaks down those guardrails, those big walls that people have put up around AI, and allows them to have a conversation with somebody else,” said Doug Thistlewolf, who manages exhibit development at the Exploratorium. For years, Silicon Valley has been at the center of innovation with some of the world’s valuable tech companies such as Meta, Google, Apple and Nvidia locating their massive headquarters south of San Francisco. But the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT — a chatbot that can generate text, images and code — set off a fierce race to propel technology that touches industries from media to healthcare. Advertisement In the first half of 2025, venture capital funding for AI companies in the San Francisco Metro area surpassed $29 billion — more than double the amount during the same period in 2022, data from PitchBook shows. Ask ChatGPT what SF will look like in 10 years and it generates an image of the city’s skyline with futuristic architecture and flying saucers next to the Golden Gate Bridge. AI has been a “bright spot” in the city’s economy, helping San Francisco to recover after retailers, office workers and some companies such as X (formerly Twitter) left the downtown area during and after the pandemic as remote work picked up. “The economic impact is [AI companies] take more office space, they pay more taxes, they hire more people,” said Ted Egan, chief economist of the city and county of San Francisco. Over the past five years, AI-related companies have leased more than 5 million square feet of San Francisco office space and the amount is projected to grow, according to CBRE, a real estate service and investment firm. The city’s office vacancy rate of 35.8% in the first quarter would be cut in half if these companies take up 16 million square feet of office space by 2030. Advertisement San Francisco resident Vijay Karunamurthy has seen the city’s boom and bust cycles unfold over the last 25 years while working at startups and tech giants such as Google and Apple. In 2000, when he moved from Chicago to San Francisco for an engineering job at a data startup, he saw major business such as Pets.com collapse during the dot-com crash. “That amount of energy being concentrated in San Francisco has just been huge for the city,” said Karunamurthy, 46, the former field chief technology officer at Scale AI, a data-labeling startup. “It means every single night there’s AI events, and if you go to a coffee shop, you’ll run into people working on AI.” Still, there are plenty of AI skeptics. In late July, outside of OpenAI’s headquarters in Mission Bay, a small group of protesters including a person dressed up as a robot held up signs that said “AI will kill us all” and “AI steals your work to steal your jobs.” Children interact with the “Giant Mirror” at the Exploratorium’s “Adventures in AI” exhibition in Downtown San Francisco on Thursday. Arno Puder, professor and chair of San Francisco State University’s computer science department, said generative AI represents a historic “paradigm shift.” The longtime San Francisco resident is equally excited, but also a little scared, about how it will affect labor. “That does make me worry a little bit, but if you ask me for a prediction on what services or what the world’s going to look like in a few years from now, I don’t know.” AI’s rise has inspired the creation of new spaces throughout San Francisco where people can discuss technology’s benefits and risks. Backed by Anthropic, the San Francisco company that developed the AI chatbot Claude, the exhibit aims to educate people about AI but doesn’t shy away from the debate surrounding technology. “Maybe there would be more money also for housing being built.” Throughout the city, AI startups are broadcasting their mission loudly on billboards and ads displayed at bus stops and train stations. Don’t replace them.” Founded in downtown San Francisco in 2022, Outset created an AI interviewer so researchers could quickly gather feedback from more people to better understand customer needs and improve products. The company’s 36-year-old chief executive, Aaron Cannon, said before the rise of ChatGPT, he and his co-founder experimented with AI systems that can generate and understand human language and saw its potential. He declined to disclose its finances but said the company, which employs 15 and counts Microsoft among its clients, is “growing fast.” Throughout San Francisco, founders and real estate companies have dubbed certain areas as AI hubs. (Florence Middleton/For The Times) Hayes Valley, a neighborhood with Victorian houses, boutique shops and trendy restaurants, bears the nickname “Cerebral Valley,” a nod to the hacker houses and AI communities that popped up in the area. Located near public transportation, water and greenery, the fresh air and serene nature of the area has attracted AI entrepreneurs that want to collaborate in person, said Michael Phillips, principal and chairman of Jamestown.

Article: The Los Angeles City Council has given final approval to a sweeping rezoning plan to meet state-mandated housing goals, clearing the path for an additional 255,000 homes to be built. But some observers believe that by 2050, the fate of L.A.’s housing stock will be decided by one of two competing ideologies: One of them is associated with many corporate landlords and investment firms, which buy up increasing shares of homes and rent them out to tenants. “The answer is to increase density, upzone areas and allow multifamily housing.” Advertisement But he doesn’t see the battle between the state and local governments (and HOAs that hope to keep things the way they are) ending any time soon. (Raul Roa / Los Angeles Times) Sacramento has a few tools at its disposal, including what is colloquially known as builder’s remedy, a penalty for cities that don’t adequately plan for California’s inevitable population increase. A drone shot shows a two-story ADU, which rests an inch from a 1920s bungalow and five feet from a 1990s duplex and a few feet from a dingbat apartment to the south. housing may very well be Senate Bill 9 , which makes it easier for California homeowners and developers to add density by splitting single-family lots in half and building duplexes, townhouses and ADUs. Thanks to a handful of bills that make ADUs easier and faster to build, Prang said ADU applications have skyrocketed since the law passed in 2021, and his office spends around 40% of its time processing them. But Prang said by 2050, he expects there to be a single portal that consolidates all the applications and checkpoints required, so new developments can be green-lit in weeks or months, not years. The measure, which took affect in 2023 and brings a transfer tax to property sales above $5 million, has already raised more than $660 million for housing and homelessness initiatives. A recent analysis from UCLA’s Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies — titled “The Unintended Consequences of Measure ULA” — suggests the tax has chilled a once-robust market in L.A., while sales above $5 million have remained steady in other markets across L.A. But by 2050, Measure ULA will likely have raised tens of billions of dollars — an unprecedented amount of cash that, if used effectively, has the potential to solve many of the cities housing woes. “We’ll use those funds to bring housing to market faster and look at creative models for home-ownership — things we haven’t been able to do for lack of funding,” said Johnson Hall, whose Housing Department oversees Measure ULA. “Our economy is dependent on giving those 20- to 30-somethings a reason to stay here.” Real estate agent Christopher Stanley is all too familiar with L.A.’s grueling application process for building, rebuilding, or even remodeling. Stanley said there’s plenty of demand for it, since the price-per-square-foot typically runs about 25% less than single-family properties, but the lengthy permitting process makes it unattractive for many developers. By 2050, Stanley said AI could make the permitting process so quick and painless that not only house-flippers and developers, but also individual homeowners, could add density to their neighborhoods. “But changing the laws will be crucial.” For Stanley, the biggest boost would come if more cities allow ADUs to be sold as separate properties, not just rented — a trend that has already caught on up the coast in Oregon and Washington. Advertisement Combine that with their inability to afford a home in the first place, and we’ll soon see the rise of co-buying: Groups of friends going in on a Silver Lake bungalow. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) “In Los Angeles, our parks include everything from neighborhood recreation centers and open spaces to theaters, beaches, lakes, aquariums, equestrian centers, golf courses, historic homes and gardens. They are the shared treasures of our community,” said Lindsey Kozberg, executive director of the Los Angeles Parks Foundation, a nonprofit that formed in 2008 as a response to budget cuts to park programs during the recession. If the trend continues, by 2050, it’ll likely require a mix of philanthropic funding and community partnerships to make sure every Angeleno has a safe and accessible park to visit. Jordan Lang, president of McCourt Partners, said gathering places have become so much more important in the age of the internet, and investing in them is vital to the growth of the city. Lang serves as president of Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies, the limited liability company behind the controversial proposed gondola system that would take baseball fans from Union Station to Dodger Stadium. “This is a test case of what we can do in L.A.,” Lang said, adding that it would also serve nearby Elysian Park, getting people out of their cars and into green spaces.

Article: “On the contrary, it is, and has been since 1888, a commodity; something to be advertised and sold to the people of the United States like automobiles, cigarettes and mouth wash. Mayo’s acerbic book “Los Angeles” appeared in 1933, when the city was in its second decade as the dominant metropolis of California; in the 1920 census, its population had finally exceeded that of San Francisco, which had been the center of the state’s economic and political life since the Gold Rush and the granting of statehood. Los Angeles lies nestled within a vast basin stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountain ranges on the north and northwest, some 3½ million acres of mostly undeveloped territory capable, in the fullness of time, of supporting a population of more than 13 million. The best natural harbor in Southern California is San Diego’s, and the nearest shore is a 30-mile trek from the pueblo that the Spaniards of Mexico established as their civic seat early in the 19th century. Its rivers are dry gulches for most of the year; Mark Twain is said to have quipped that he once fell into a Southern California river and “come out all dusty.” The Los Angeles that became the queen city of California did not grow naturally, but had to be “conjured into existence.” Almost everything that made it habitable needed to be imported. Its water came from a river valley 200 miles away and its electricity from a river canyon 300 miles to the east, brought to the city via systems that are titanic marvels of human engineering. In 1850, while San Francisco was basking in the stupendous influx of people and wealth produced by the Gold Rush, Los Angeles was still barely a village, with 1,610 inhabitants recorded in the 1850 census and “no newspaper, hospital, public school, college, library, Protestant church, factory, bank, or public utility of any kind.” One-third of its residents could neither read nor write. Beef prices were driven so high by the surge in demand that Mexican ranchers flooded the market with livestock, eroding what had been a Southern California monopoly; by 1855, the competition had sent prices plummeting by 75%. Yet another drought arrived in 1863, killing cattle by the tens of thousands; for years to come travelers in the south would be “often startled by coming suddenly on a veritable Golgotha, a place of skulls, the long horns standing out in defiant attitude, as if protecting the fleshless bones.” Pitching the Southern California dream The promotion of Southern California’s Mediterranean climate took hold in the first decade after the Gold Rush and continued into the new century. “The diseases of children prevalent elsewhere are unknown here,” reported Charles Dudley Warner, the co-author with Mark Twain of the 1873 novel “The Gilded Age.” “They cut their teeth without risk, and cholera infantum never visits them. These facts are derived from medical practice.” A “Winter in California” postcard postmarked 1905 from the collection of Patt Morrison draws a sharp contrast between East and West Coast winters. Truman, an East Coast transplant, compiled the death rates from all causes in American cities for his 1885 book “Homes and Happiness in the Golden State of California” and found 37 deaths per thousand inhabitants in New Orleans; 24 in St. “From such diseases many of the towns of California are remarkably free.” The German-born journalist Charles Nordhoff wrote glowingly of the regional climate’s health-giving qualities for tuberculosis patients, describing it as the French Riviera’s equal, lacking only the deluxe hospitality infrastructure of that renowned gathering place of the rich: “You will not find ... Nature has done much; man has not, so far, helped her.” If he was trying to alert resort developers to the existence of a blank slate to be written on for great profit, he could hardly have done better A place to start anew In 1887, some 120,000 passengers were brought into Los Angeles by the Southern Pacific railroad, while the Santa Fe served the region with as many as four passenger trains a day. Los Angeles “suddenly changed from a very old city to a very young one.” In 1890, more than three-fourths of its residents had lived in the city for fewer than four years. a crowd of speculators settled down upon Los Angeles like flies upon a bowl of sugar.” The railroads brought swarms of sharp operators who had already drained the Midwest of its potential for land fraud and detected on the West Coast a “golden opportunity of the fakir and humbug and the man with the past that he wanted forgotten,” a municipal historian wrote. Promoters established new townsites on every patch of vacant land, building hotels and laying down concrete sidewalks and community halls: “A miniature city appeared, like a scene conjured up by Aladdin’s lamp, where a few months ago the jack-rabbit sported and the coyote howled,” Brook wrote. Nearly 1.5 million new residents moved into Southern California between 1920 and 1930, an influx that was labeled “the largest internal migration in the history of the American people,” and one that would not be exceeded until the postwar 1940s and 1950s.

Article: A writer learns to embrace her imperfect recovery from an eating disorder GeorgePeters/Digital Vision Vectors/Getty Images When Mallary Tenore Tarpley was 11 years old, her mother died from breast cancer. Sponsor Message "I found that calorie counts gave me some semblance of control in the aftermath of my mother's death; I couldn't control what happened to her body, but I could regulate what I put in mine," she writes. In her new book, SLIP: Life in the Middle of Eating Disorder Recovery, which combines memoir and research, Tarpley, now 40, writes about living with an eating disorder and the insights she's gained as an adult. Instead of the low-fat foods and heroin-chic of the 1990s, everyone seems to be using GLP-1s and #skinnytok, a social media hashtag promoting eating disorders, had millions of views before it was banned by TikTok in June. In her book, she writes about living in this "middle place." She examines how shifting from an all-or-nothing recovery approach of her teens and early 20s to one where setbacks are expected and accepted has allowed her to live a full life while continuing to strive for progress. Then [as a journalist], I started to do some work around restorative narratives, which is this genre that is really looking at how people in communities make meaningful pathways forward in the aftermath of trauma and illness. Around this time I was also meeting my now husband and was beginning to realize that if I want to be in a meaningful relationship with him, it would have to be rooted in honesty. So many of the people I interviewed [for the book] said that they inhabit this [middle] place, and that to be able to own that narrative and to give words to it was really helpful. There are moments when I feel like there's a little bit of a fake-it-till-you-make-it situation where I will talk with my kids about their bodies, and I will be thinking negatively about my own. I'm talking with them about how strong they are, and how their bodies help them move through the world, and how I want them to feel like they can take up space in the world, and yet I find that I still have trouble doing that myself.

Article: European nations have rallied behind Ukraine, emphasizing that peace cannot be achieved without Kyiv's involvement KYIV, Ukraine -- European nations rallied behind Ukraine, saying peace in the war-torn nation can’t be resolved without Kyiv, ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. Zelenskyy responded by thanking European allies and wrote on X on Sunday: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people." Saturday's statement by top European leaders came after the White House confirmed the U.S president was willing to grant Putin the one-on-one meeting Russia has long pushed for, and suggestions from Trump that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories," raising fears Kyiv may be pressured into giving up land or accepting other curbs on its sovereignty. A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they aren’t allowed to speak publicly, told The Associated Press that Trump remained open to a trilateral summit with both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, but for now, he will have a bilateral meeting requested by Putin. The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there’s no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. Saturday's statement, signed by the president of the European Union and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the UK, stressed the need for a “just and lasting peace” for Kyiv, including “robust and credible” security guarantees. A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. Trump had also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Ukrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine’s inability to regain lost territories militarily.

Article: “The theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,” said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool. “There’s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments — especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.” Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% — while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. “I think up until now, you’ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.” Employers would have to decide to offer the plans — and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there’s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. “Without proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.” Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses. “So that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.” Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers. “Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.” He continued: “Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments — appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules — could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.” Experts believe it could take months to see any changes.

Article: Johner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images Investors may soon have greater access to private assets — that is, investments that are not publicly traded — in their 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a "prudent investment mix" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan. Defined-contribution workplace plans — which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others — held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. "Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets," Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email. "If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are," said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it." The law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries. "It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid," Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst for TD Cowen, wrote in a policy note on July 16. Private assets may be slow to 'gain traction' Private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR have introduced new products to make inroads into defined contribution plans.

Article: Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic who once described Covid-19 shots as “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” announced on Tuesday that he is terminating nearly $500 million in federal contracts supporting the development of next-generation vaccines and other treatments based on mRNA technology. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses,” he said in a video posted online. You can’t explain the evolution from Trump’s first administration, which fast-tracked the development of mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 through Operation Warp Speed, to the second term’s anti-vax, “Make America Healthy Again” schtick without talking about the network’s role in turning the GOP base against vaccines and toward conspiracy theorists like Kennedy. When pharmaceutical companies began rolling out the vaccines produced under the Trump administration in late 2020 and early 2021, Fox News’ stars could have used the unique influence they have over their viewers to encourage them to get their Covid-19 shots. But Trump had lost his re-election bid, and the network that had worked so hard to keep him in office instead pandered to anti-vaxxers by turning against the vaccination campaign helmed by his successor, President Joe Biden. Led by its then-prime-time star Tucker Carlson, the network incessantly promoted misleading and false claims about safe, effective vaccines with the potential to save their viewers’ lives — day after day, month after month, year after year. Fox News continued to broadcast these segments even as more Republican parts of the country, with lower vaccination rates, suffered higher Covid-19 death tolls, as The New York Times’ David Leonhardt detailed. Before the pandemic, Kennedy, the scion of a Democratic dynasty who once called for a boycott of Fox News host Sean Hannity and described him as a fascist, was not a natural fit for the Fox audience. But with the Covid-19 vaccine campaign underway, his decades of work undermining vaccines and his attacks on the new mRNA vaccines in particular suddenly made him attractive to the right. All of the fawning attention on Kennedy from the right — alongside mainstream news coverage of his bizarre history, such as his claim that a parasite in his brain had triggered memory loss — had the impact one would expect: Kennedy became more popular with Republicans than Democrats. As Kennedy’s nomination moved through the Senate, they touted him as a “reformer” and “true health care crusader” who had “the skills, knowledge, and experience” needed for the job.” When Kennedy said he wasn’t going to take away anyone’s vaccines, Fox said he wasn’t going to take away anyone’s vaccines.

ICE officials told The Wall Street Journal that in mid-May the White House ordered them to stop “develop[ing] target lists of immigrants” and just “go out on the streets” and make arrests right away. Deportation czar Tom Homan told Fox News that agents will detain people “based on the location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions like … they walk away.” DHS describes these interactions as “consensual.” But they are anything but. As a California district court put it, “When individuals have tried to avoid an encounter with agents and officers, they have been followed and pushed to the ground, sometimes even beaten, and then taken away.” Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week. In one case, DHS agents pepper-sprayed, tackled and brutally beat a landscaper in Los Angeles after they profiled him outside an IHOP, and — according to DHS — he “refused to answer questions” and tried to leave. In another case, agents jumped from a car to arrest a random Latino man on the street who asserted in English, “I have the right to remain silent.” The one thing that the DHS data does not record: how many times DHS illegally profiles U.S. After they learned she was a citizen, they charged her with impeding their efforts to chase down other people to determine “whether they were lawfully present.” In other words, their defense against charges of illegal profiling was: We were profiling someone else! The appeals court reaffirmed prior rulings that have found it is unconstitutional to stop or detain people based on broad characteristics that would “cast suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.” It said this included not just race, but also language ability, occupation and location, such as Home Depot. Not only that, under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration agents don’t even have the authority to interrogate someone without a warrant or reason to believe that the person is a noncitizen.

One Jane Doe, speaking in court in 2019, testified that she and the other victims “will always carry irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives after this.” Victims typically enter exploitation during critical stages of their physical, emotional and cognitive development.

Article: Many of President Donald Trump's picks to be federal judges have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions Trump has said abortion is a state issue. As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations “are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.” "It’s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,” she said. “The Democrats’ extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump’s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.” Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” — Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution’s protections for religious freedom. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a “barbaric practice” and “one of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable” in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. — Joshua Divine, a deputy solicitor general of Missouri who is nominated to be a district judge in the state, is currently representing Missouri in a case challenging the FDA approval of mifepristone. Divine co-authored the lawsuit, which includes misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb.” In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a “zealot" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as “the killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being” and argued that life begins at fertilization. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion. Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life, said she was hopeful the administration will continue nominating those “who will respect the rule of law.” Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time. Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said the courts, until now, have largely been an effective option for advocates to challenge state abortion bans and restrictions. “This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion — saying he’s going to leave it to the states while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," she said.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House. In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” One from Missouri spread misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb” in a lawsuit aiming to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Article: Tube staff face deportation under new visa rules 5 hours ago Share Save Kumail Jaffer Local Democracy Reporting Service Share Save PA Media Scores of Transport for London staff are facing deportation because of new immigration rules Scores of foreign Transport for London (TfL) staff could be deported because of rule changes which mean they no longer qualify for visa sponsorship. More than 60 employees who came to the UK on skilled worker visas may have to leave because salary thresholds have gone up and key transport roles have been taken off the eligible list. It added: "Under this approach, every sector will be required to implement a workforce strategy focused on training British workers, or risk losing access to the immigration system, as part of wider efforts to reinforce the integrity of the points-based system and end dependence on lower-skilled international recruitment." TfL is obliged to comply with the changes, which took effect on 22 July and will remain until at least the end of 2026. "Now the new government rules risk shattering these workers' lives and leaving gaps in employment for London Underground." The Home Office has been urged to reverse the "unfair and short-sighted" changes According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, an anonymous at-risk employee said they just wanted a fair chance to work and loved their job. It was like a nuclear bomb going off in our household." The leader of London Assembly's Liberal Democrat group, Hina Bokhari, said: "Deporting vital Tube staff because of sudden last-minute rule changes is unfair and short-sighted. "London relies on the skills and commitment of these people." Green Party Assembly member Caroline Russell said: "The government should withdraw these cruel changes that are going to ruin lives by sending away the workers London depends upon."

Article: The NFL announced a deal with ESPN this week that differs significantly from how the league and one of its most important broadcast partners have always done business with each other. Instead of the traditional exchange in which ESPN hands the NFL a pile of cash for the rights to air a slate of Monday Night Football games (and some other games), this deal marries the two entities together as equity partners. The NFL will now own a 10% slice of ESPN, and the country’s biggest sports network will take over some of the league’s media properties, including the NFL Network and the Red Zone Channel, which gives live updates from every game when teams are close to scoring a touchdown. “So what if I told you,” to borrow the language that ESPN used to promote its 30 for 30 series, that the league’s biggest TV deal yet could be the catalyst for a decline in football’s popularity similar to what boxing experienced after it reached a high mark in the late ‘80s and ‘90s? The league’s 32 teams shared a record $13.8 billion in national revenues last season, prompting a rise in the NFL salary cap that in the offseason led to record contracts for players like Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns and his rival, edge rusher TJ Watt of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Selling a stake in the network to the most powerful of those partners is aimed at helping ESPN, whose parent company, The Walt Disney Co., just announced a consolidation of its streaming services when it launches its own $30/month streaming service this month. When the NFL launched its popular Sunday Ticket service in 1994, it did so through one partner, DirecTV, which carried every regular season game and charged consumers between $99 and $139 a season for the full package. Fifteen Thursday Night Football games now stream exclusively on Amazon’s Prime Video platform, which costs money to access, and two Christmas Day contests will play on Netflix, which also costs money to access. That day could be far off, given that the league’s deal with YouTube runs though the 2029 season, but it’s likely executives have thought about unconventional ways of selling the games to consumers. Former ESPN president John Skipper, who left the network in 2017, argued on a 2023 podcast that “the single best way I can think of for the NFL to increase their annual revenue take for their clubs, is to make the Super Bowl a Pay-Per-View event.” He suggested that the NFL could charge viewers up to $250 to watch the Super Bowl. Several factors contributed to the sport’s decline, but one of the reasons was that, beginning in the 1980s, the promoters who ran the sport largely eschewed a free broadcast audience in favor of major pay-per-view events. The irony here is that the Saudi boxing promoter Turki Alalshikh, currently considered the most innovative promoter in the sport, recently announced a partnership with the streamer DAZN under which none of his future fights will be oﬀered on a pay-per-view basis.

Earlier that day, she was asked on national television why Republican President Donald Trump had not endorsed her and whether she stood by her description of him as liability back in 2022, before his return to the Oval Office about two years later. Responding to written questions about the donations, a spokesperson for the association said: “Winsome Earle-Sears is the only candidate in this race who will keep Virginia on the right track forged by Gov. Under their leadership, parents’ rights have been protected, Virginia’s economy is growing, and communities are safe.” Youngkin, who is term-limited, has offered more than $21,000 in support to Earle-Sears through his political action committee between March and June. When asked in June whether he would give more, his PAC said the governor was "working to elect the entire GOP ticket and is urging all Virginians to support the commonsense team this November to keep Virginia winning.” Republicans went into this election facing tough sledding in swing-state Virginia. In a prayer, Cherry asked God to “imbue her with strength and stamina for the days that are to come in the final, waning days of this election.” Wyatt encouraged voters to help Earle-Sears continue the successes of Youngkin’s administration.

Article: A study by the Pew Research Center found that users who encounter an AI summary when searching are about half as likely to click on a traditional search result than those who aren't met with one. Another survey from Bain found that 80% of consumers have come to rely on these "zero-click" results in at least 40% of searches — reducing organic web traffic by approximately 15%-25%, Bain said. GOOGL 1M mountain GOOGL in past month "Alphabet continues to defy the bears, just like this last quarter, and all of our survey data shows that search continues to be pretty robust from a query perspective," said Ives. "Now, AI is clearly a near-term potential headwind for Google, but we actually believe they turn it into a talent." Ives believes that Google — as well as rivals such as Meta Platforms — will learn how to monetize AI search. The potential losers While it's hard to pinpoint just exactly how this will affect business' bottom lines, Barclays anticipates that the impairments will begin to emerge more clearly from here. "Over time, as search referral traffic declines, companies are faced with a challenging situation whereby they can: 1) maintain profit margins while watching their top line decelerate or decline, or 2) supplement the loss of search referral traffic by spending more on customer acquisition across paid channels, which would compress margins but keep growth rates consistent," the bank wrote in a July note to clients. "In general, we view that neither of these are contemplated in the current consensus estimates over the medium term." Barclays found that companies that rely more on web traffic from search results versus direct traffic are more likely to face a larger disruption. Robert Pavlik of Dakota Wealth Management highlighted the following as stocks that could be negatively impacted by AI search: eBay , NerdWallet , Wayfair , Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Chegg . ChatGPT doesn't sell you a chair for your living room, so probably will have to direct you to a site some way." Ives even highlighted Pinterest as a stock he's bullish on amid the shifts in search.

The S & P 500 currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 22 times, near the top of its historical average over the past 20 years, when it's averaged about a 16 times multiple, according to FactSet data. "The idea of concentration risk of only a handful of stocks [that] are making all of the money and seeing all of the flow is not unique — we've seen this movie before," Savage told CNBC Pro in an interview. For that to happen, there needs to be more clarity as to how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates, as well as how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy. "So even if the Fed does cut 50 basis points [half a percentage point], as everyone expects, it might not be sufficient to make that equation work." "Welcome to my world of uncertainty," he added.

With that aim in mind, the growing presence of generative AI such as ChatGPT in the shopping ecosystem may next take a shape that has a seismic impact on the economic model of internet retail. Currently, a search for a large London Fog men's coat on ChatGPT will bring up a purchase option, but you still have to click over to London Fog's site to complete the transaction. Gen AI search engine Perplexity already has a deal with PayPal for this kind of function, allowing online shoppers to make purchases such as concert tickets and travel directly in chat, with payments completed with PayPal or Venmo, and PayPal handling the processing, shipping, tracking, and invoicing. The Financial Times reported last month that an integrated checkout system is coming to ChatGPT, with partners such as Shopify , so that users can complete the transaction within the platform. OpenAI has already rolled out several features designed to enhance shopping and other consumer experiences, and experts say that in one form or another, this further use of gen AI in retail's future should be expected, and companies need to be planning for the consequences today. "Enabling customers to purchase without leaving the chat will have a significant impact on the sales cycle," said Elizabeth Perkins, professor of practice of business administration and economics at Roanoke College. Power's senior director of banking intelligence, says he thinks that while AI checkout capabilities will disrupt the checkout ecosystem, big players will find a way to stay in the game. This will affect the upstarts the most, some of which will probably get gobbled up by larger competitors."

A recent study into the return of Indigenous fire burning in Australia’s Kimberley region showed that the annual massive wildfires in the region had reduced to once-in-a-decade events since the practice was reintroduced by the traditional owners of the land. The use of fire for sustainable resource management is also one of the recommendations that the organisation I work for, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, is recommending as part of its integrated fire management approach.

It feels like the universe is crazy.” Masiullah Sahil, 37, is accused of first-degree murder in Niazi’s death and, until last month, was being held in lieu of $750,000 bond. After prosecutors failed to indict him within three months, as Texas law requires, a judge ordered him released on a personal recognizance bond that required no payment, court records show.

Article: Mohamed Salah, one of soccer’s biggest stars, criticized the sport’s governing body in Europe over its tribute to Suleiman Al-Obeid, known as the “Pelé of Palestinian football,” which failed to mention how he died last week. “A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Salah, a forward for the Premier League club Liverpool and captain of the Egyptian national team, said in response. Salah, 33, has been a vocal advocate for increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, which the United Nations and other international experts say is on the brink of famine 22 months into Israel’s war with Hamas, which controls the enclave of about 2 million people. Finding food has become more difficult and deadly for Palestinians since late May, when the American and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over the distribution of aid after Israel lifted a two-and-half-month blockade. Eric Cantona, a former professional soccer player from France who was a forward for Manchester United, posted a tribute on Instagram alongside a photo of al-Obeid, asking, “HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE GOING TO LET THEM COMMIT THIS GENOCIDE???” Israel insists that it is fighting an existential war and rejects genocide allegations as antisemitic. On Saturday, the PFA shared a statement attributed to UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, praising al-Obeid for giving “talent and dedication to the children of Gaza” and giving their dreams “hope to blossom despite the suffering.” Al-Obeid scored more than 100 goals over his long career, including two for the Palestinian national team, “making him one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football,” the PFA said.

"Necaxa," produced by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, is in some ways like a spinoff of the two men's hugely successful “Welcome to Wrexham” series focused on an underdog Welsh soccer team — and its recent, remarkable rise.

They're having family issues, they're having injuries — there’s so much that goes into winning championships." Diego González, a former player and the current press officer for the club, said, “Necaxa, for me, is truly a family.” “In the end, we spend much more time at the club or with the team than even in our own homes, so it ends up being a family for us,” he said in a video interview. And I grew up in the ’90s, which was when we won, you know, three championships.” During that decade, Necaxa also had a silver age, winning three Mexican league titles. This isn’t the first time she has backed an underdog; she's credited with stepping up to save the first movie of the popular neo-noir revenge franchise “John Wick” with a last-minute investment of $6 million just over a decade ago.

Article: Actor Ray Brooks, voice of Mr Benn, dies aged 86 19 minutes ago Share Save Maia Davies & John Hand BBC News Share Save BBC Brooks's sons said their dad 'shunned the spotlight' despite his dazzling TV career TV actor Ray Brooks, who starred in some of the UK's best-known programmes in a career spanning five decades, has died aged 86. He played Norman Philips in the ITV soap in the 1960s, and arrived in Albert Square 40 years later to portray Joe Macer, who infamously murdered his wife Pauline Fowler. In a statement, the actor's sons Will and Tom said their dad thought he was best known for Mr Benn, "with people continually asking him to say the catchphrase 'as if by magic!'". Brooks starred alongside Sharon Duce in the 1980s primetime show Big Deal The list of TV shows in which Brooks appeared in the 1960s and 1970s reads like a run-down of the British small screen's biggest hits of the era. He played Georgio, the waiter in the crumbling hotel, in Carry On Abroad in 1972, and also killed daleks and cybermen in the 1966 Dr Who movie Daleks' Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. Brooks in Cathy Come Home, which is regarded as one of Britain's most ground-breaking TV programmes His most acclaimed role came early in his career when he played Reg in the gritty BBC TV play Cathy Come Home, which chronicled Britain's housing shortage in the late 1960s. In Big Deal, his character Robbie Box seeks to make a living playing poker and betting on horses and dogs - while trying to keep his relationship together with his partner Jan, played by Sharon Duce. The fast-talking Londoner became one of TV's best-loved working-class characters in an era of Del Boy Trotter and Arthur Daley Brooks joined EastEnders in 2005 as Joe Macer, who went on to marry and murder one of the show's original characters, Pauline Fowler, after she hit him with a frying pan

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows. Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable — with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher — in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data. High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don’t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.” An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. “This is showing a massive increase over a relatively short period of time.” That seemingly small increase in average dew points really means the worst ultra-sticky days that used to happen once a year, now happen several times a summer, which is what affects people, Lee said. For most of the summer, the Midwest and East were stuck under either incredibly hot high pressure systems, which boosted temperatures, or getting heavy and persistent rain in amounts much higher than average, Taylor said.

Article: The rise of generative AI and large language models has drastically shifted the cybersecurity landscape, empowering attackers with easy-to-use tools that can create realistic video and voice deepfakes, personalized phishing campaigns, and malware and malicious code. As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts. "AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization," Murphy said. In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said "We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live," adding that he sees a future with "billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field," helping workers "focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically" while also making "our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today." Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent. "AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do." ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team. "Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do," Murphy said, adding that it's like having a "teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability." Murphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings. Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins. "Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals." Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a "crawl, walk, run methodology." "You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken," he said. "I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems." What AI bots mean for cybersecurity workers While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement. Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles. "The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk." Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI. Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions. Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it "moderately beneficial," but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks. "You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface." Murphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal.

Article: Explicit death threats have been made against dozens of Afghan women working for the United Nations in Afghanistan, according to a new UN report, where their rights have been severely curtailed since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The UN mission to the country said female national staff were subjected to direct death threats in May, in the latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan published on Sunday. The report also highlighted other areas affecting women’s personal freedoms and safety, including inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry requiring women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head. A UN report from August 2024 found that Afghanistan’s Taliban government has “deliberately deprived” at least 1.4 million girls of their right to an education during its three years in power. About 300,000 more girls are missing out on school since UNESCO last carried out a count in April 2023, it said on Thursday, warning that “the future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy.” ICC targets Taliban for persecution of women The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants in July for two top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on charges of abuses against women and girls. “While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the court said in a statement in July. The Taliban has rejected the ICC warrants as “baseless rhetoric”, saying it does not recognise the ICC’s authority, and underlined the court’s failure to protect the “hundreds of women and children being killed daily” in Gaza.

Article: Firefighters in southern France have warned that a huge fire they have been battling, which spread across an area bigger than Paris, could reignite as the region continues to face a scorching heatwave. “It’s a challenging day, given that we are likely to be on red alert for heatwave from 4:00pm (14:00 GMT), which will not make things any easier,” said Christian Pouget, Aude’s prefect. The fire is no longer spreading but is still burning within a 16,000-hectare area, the chief of the region’s firefighter unit, Christophe Magny, said on Saturday, adding it would not be under control until Sunday evening. Temperatures this weekend are expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas, while Monday is forecast to be the “hottest day nationwide”, according to national weather service Meteo France. Fires burning elsewhere in Europe Elsewhere in Europe, fires also rage, with experts stating that European countries are becoming more prone to such disasters due to intensifying summer heatwaves linked to global warming. The national fire service said it had 12 teams on the ground and six Canadair planes fighting the blaze, which has torn through the national park in southern Italy since Friday.

He cheats on his wives, he cheats at golf, and now he's trying to cheat the American people out of their votes." Democratic state legislators from Texas have been huddling in Illinois and other blue states after leaving the state to deny GOP leaders a quorum in the state House.

At first he considered finding a way to move his career to Taiwan, until he realized he didn't want to deal with its demanding work culture. They timed it so Forrest would be in Taiwan for his kindergarten year, and decided to spend 13 months abroad to match up with the academic year, plus summer breaks, to get him back stateside for first grade. Courtesy of subject Jason says he viewed the goal like any household would save up for a home renovation project, and they used the You Need a Budget app to track their savings. 'This is not something that can afford to wait' Jason says timing was important: Not only did he want to make sure Forrest had enough time with his grandparents and to adjust to kindergarten, but taking the leap was also crucial for himself, Katie and the grandparents. I just didn't feel like that was a good trade off." We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before. Jason Lee American on a sabbatical in Taiwan What's more, he wanted to make sure that Forrest had time to interact with his grandparents while they are still in good health and mobile. Overall, Jason says, "as I look back to this year and I think about all the trips we were able to do and all the memories we were able to make, it's absolutely worth it." 'We are so happy right now' In addition to spending more quality time with family, Jason set a few personal and professional goals for himself for his sabbatical. "The whole last 10 years, I've been dictating my career next steps not based on what I want, but based on what the world or LinkedIn tells me I should want," Jason says. "I just realized how much of that has set me up for being unhappy, when I don't prioritize myself or what I want." By March, he sat down with Katie with a big realization that once they returned to the U.S., they were OK with not chasing the same salaries they had before. "We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before." Returning to the U.S. Katie gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, in early July, so the family of four will return to the states in October when she has a passport and is able to travel.

Article: CAIRO, Egypt — Mohamed Salah is questioning UEFA’s “farewell” to former Palestinian soccer player Suleiman Obeid who was reportedly shot and killed by Israeli forces while awaiting aid in Gaza. “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” Salah asked on the social network X in response to a post from UEFA saying, “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pele.’ A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” Obeid, 41, was fatally shot by Israeli forces on Wednesday while he was waiting among crowds for aid near a distribution site in southern Gaza, the Palestine Football Association said. Obeid played 24 games for Palestine, scoring two goals, while he scored more than 100 over his career with local clubs, said the PFA, which described him as “one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football.” The PFA published a letter attributed to Aleksander Čeferin in which the UEFA president said he was “deeply saddened by the tragic death” of Obeid, who was “more than just a footballer. His passing is a great loss to the world of football and to everyone who understands the power of sport to inspire.” The PFA said Obeid’s death brings to 662 the number of Palestinian athletes and sporting officials killed since the 22-month war started.

Advertisement An October report from parliament’s Research Center showed 85 percent of Iran’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, 13 percent from hydropower and the remainder from renewables and nuclear power. Now, after months of unpredictable outages, Fatemeh has a survival routine: storing water in multiple containers, pouring it into her evaporative cooler when cuts occur and tossing blocks of ice into vents during extreme heat. Ripple effect The infrastructure crisis extends beyond household inconveniences and is threatening livelihoods across the economy as offices and retail shops are forced to close for hours or for the day. By the time power comes back, it is the end of their working day.” Experts attribute the energy crisis to insufficient investment, failure to adopt new technologies – both of which are influenced by international sanctions – and unsustainable consumption. As Iran approaches another winter with unresolved water and energy deficits, the experiences of Sara, Fatemeh, Shahram and millions like them suggest that the country’s infrastructure crisis has moved beyond temporary inconvenience to become a defining feature of modern Iranian life.

Article: Salmond allies dismiss Sturgeon memoir leak claims 37 minutes ago Share Save Katy Scott BBC Scotland News Share Save PA Media Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in 2013, formed a formidable political partnership Allies of Alex Salmond have dismissed Nicola Sturgeon's suggestion that he leaked details about an investigation into sexual misconduct claims made against him. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." In her upcoming memoir, Frankly, Sturgeon denied releasing details about the investigation, or any having any knowledge of who did. PA Media Kenny MacAskill has called for an inquiry to look into the Scottish government's investigation of claims against Alex Salmond MacAskill recently called for a public inquiry into the handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Salmond, who he succeeded as Alba leader. "This hypocrisy is yet another reason for an inquiry into the Scottish government's actions relating to Alex Salmond." Meanwhile, Chris McEleny claimed the investigation was a "stitch up" and that several public bodies had "conspired to jail Salmond". "Nicola might think she can fabricate her own version of the truth now that Alex is no longer here but the reality is her book will end up in a bargain basket whilst Alex Salmond will reside in the pages of the Scottish history books." Journalist David Clegg broke the story about the Salmond investigation when he was political editor of the Daily Record. "But I think it shows the level of suspicion and the deep rift that had formed between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon prior to his death." He said the "factual account" of what happened when the story emerged was laid out in his book, Break-Up, which he co-wrote with journalist Kieran Andrews. "But if it was Alex Salmond who had leaked it, when I phoned him up that night to put the claims to him, he did an incredible acting job of seeming surprised and shocked. "I have heard this from people close to Nicola Sturgeon before and it's always struck me as not credible and I would be very surprised if it was the case." Getty Images Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges after a two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh in March 2020 When asked if he knew the source of the leak, Clegg said: "I have had many nights thinking about who may have sent that in and I've had some suspicions over the years and guesses - but the truth is I'm not even sure who it was." In her book extract, published in The Sunday Times, Nicola Sturgeon also dismissed suggestions of a "conspiracy" between the Scottish government, civil service, the complainants and the Crown Office against Salmond. "And that would be that somebody thought this information was in the public interest and was concerned that it was going to be covered up so tried to get it out." Sturgeon previously spoke about Salmond in a Financial Times interview in January, where she said he "would be really rough on people." Salmond's widow, Moira, later said comments about her husband had caused the family "great distress". "My wish, and sincere hope, is that these attacks will now stop." Getty Images Nicola Sturgeon, who was first elected in 1999, will stand down as Glasgow Southside MSP next year The extract is the second to be published from Sturgeon's memoir. Elsewhere in the extracts, the former SNP leader describes the pain of suffering a miscarriage and sets out her views on sexuality, which she says she does not consider "to be binary".

Article: Lindsey Graham said in an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press" that Russia and Ukraine would have to swap some territory in any ceasefire agreement, echoing President Donald Trump's comments about land exchanges. "I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end," Graham, R-S.C., said during Sunday's interview. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine would "not give their land to occupiers." His comments came after Trump said on Friday that “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.” Graham said land exchanges would only happen "after you have security guarantees to Ukraine to prevent Russia from doing this again." "You need to tell Putin what happens if he does it a third time," Graham said, referring to Russia annexing Crimea in 2014 in addition to Russia's 2022 invasion. Asked during the interview whether it was the right move for Trump to hold a summit with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday in an attempt to broker a ceasefire agreement, Graham said he was "very okay" with the meeting, later adding that he hoped Zelenskyy could be involved. In 2023, he said in a statement that "The Ukrainians understand you don’t end wars by giving territory to the aggressor." The senator also warned at the time that if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine, "he will keep going," increasing the chance that NATO could be drawn into a war. and allies should continue arming Ukraine, put some European forces on the ground, and build up "economic integration." If Putin were to invade Ukraine again, he would "be fighting more than just Ukraine, having some European forces on the ground as trip wires," Graham said. He also pointed to the split of Germany's capital after World War II into East and West Berlin and later reunification, noting that the city "existed divided for a very long time."

Article: Because you haven't done it, it doesn't mean you can't do it if it costs a little money to do it, because you should have been budgeting for this for the last 30 years.” Senate Bill 1 addresses multiple problems found after the catastrophic July Fourth flooding. The bill establishes clear "lines of succession" in the event the EMC is unavailable, beginning with the county sheriff and then proceeding to the county commissioner with the longest continuous service. “You don't get to have a plan and say, 'We have a plan and we never actually tested the plan.'” Counties with 68,750 or fewer residents would need to have a united city and county incident command post during a disaster. “It will be one unit, so that when TDEM and other resources come into your being, they have one place, one team, and one person to coordinate with,” Perry said. “So that there's not this confusion over who's on first and what's on third.” Perry didn’t mince words when rebuking the shortcomings of how local leaders responded to the flooding. “I'm not saying some of them weren't legitimate reasons, but even had those people been there, truthfully listening to them, nobody knew what they were supposed to be doing.” The bill also includes additional rules for youth camps located in a 100-year floodplain. “All those warning systems are great, and we had some warning systems in place, but what we didn't have is leadership willing to do an evacuation call at the right time,” Perry said. Nim Kidd, the Chief of the TDEM, has told lawmakers that thousands of volunteers showed up to help in the days following the flooding – most of them "good-hearted Texans" that wanted to help in any way for "no thanks and no pay." Kidd said the state's Incident Support Task Force enables the establishment, within the first 12 hours of an incident, of a volunteer reception center where volunteers can check in and share their capabilities. It is about keeping a disaster organized from the beginning as early as possible.” Kidd said the background checks would be no different than if those when purchasing a gun. Vince Luciano, the Central Texas regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, stated that the bill’s volunteer requirements would be impossible to implement, as only law enforcement can conduct background checks, which would need to be processed through a dispatch center. “Dispatch centers were overloaded during all these events, so you're not going to have the ability to do that.” The Senate panel also advanced Senate Bill 2, by State Sen. The panel also advanced Senate Bill 13, which provides credits for cities and counties to make flood prevention fixes, and Senate Bill 43, which allows the TCEQ to issue permits for dam and reservoir repairs. Republicans claim that Democrats are blocking critical flood bills by not being present at the Capitol, but Democrats argue that Governor Abbott could act and allocate state funds towards these issues without lawmakers' approval.

I told my mom maybe it was just not meant for us to see each other again.” During a brief block on the order, the woman made it into the U.S., one of only about 70 refugees to arrive in the country since Trump took office. “It’s been a really devastating roller coaster for those families, to be stuck in this limbo of not knowing whether their hope of being resettled in the United States will ever come true,” said Melissa Keaney, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project. But Trump's executive order halting the program said communities didn’t have the ability to “absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.” Organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project and some refugees, including the Congolese woman and her mother, sued over Trump's order in February. — they push it shut right in front of me.” Looking back on her time in the Nyarugusu refugee camp, she remembers teaching her little brother to ride a bike and whispering with her sister late at night. With little hope of a viable future, her mother made a plan: The 15-year-old would walk to South Africa, where she would have a better chance of finishing school and building a life. “When I left, the idea of them going to be resettled was never in the mind at all.” Her family settled in Boise, Idaho, and her mother signed her up for the “follow to join” program in 2017. Last year, her case was handed over to lawyers volunteering their time "and that’s when we started seeing some light.” By January, she had her travel documents and gave up her home. The appeals court ordered the government to admit thousands more conditionally accepted refugees, but the administration has created new roadblocks, Keaney said, including decreasing the time refugees' security screenings are valid to 30 days —- down from three years.

Article: Ukraine’s military has said it struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Saratov region in an overnight drone attack, causing explosions and destruction, according to an army statement, as daily aerial exchanges intensify with diplomatic momentum to end the war in play. “[Ukrainian] drones are targeting … deeper into Russian territory [than] in the past, where previous attacks have been focused on the line of contact in the south and the western parts of Russia,” said Al Jazeera’s Osama bin Javed, reporting Moscow. Russia’s war in Ukraine is now into its in fourth year, as European leaders have welcomed plans by United States President Donald Trump to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on ending the conflict. Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region also killed two people travelling in a car in the Bilenkivska community on Saturday, as well as a 61-year-old woman who was in her home in the Vasylivka district, a local official reported. Europe stresses support for Ukraine ahead of Trump-Putin talks Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected any suggestion of land concessions to Russia as international efforts to end the war continue. Trump, who had promised to end the war within 24 hours of reentering the White House, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties were close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Finland, together with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, on Sunday issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s efforts, while stressing the need to maintain support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia. “The emphasis [of the European statement was] … that this is a war that is in Ukraine, but is in Europe too, and has huge potential ramifications for European security,” said Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal also reported that European officials who met US Vice President JD Vance in the United Kingdom on Saturday had presented a counterproposal for peace, which included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken.

Article: Jordan will host a Jordanian-Syrian-American meeting on Tuesday to discuss ways to support the rebuilding of Syria, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates says, as Damascus seeks investment deals with international companies to revive its war-ravaged economy. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s fledgling government has been grappling with the fallout from sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze fighters in the southern province of Suwayda as well as Israeli strikes on Syrian soldiers and the capital, Damascus. Jordan made its announcement after Damascus signed 12 agreements worth $14bn on Wednesday, including a $4bn agreement with Qatar’s UCC Holding to build a new airport and a $2bn deal to establish a subway in Damascus with the national investment corporation of the United Arab Emirates. The projects “will extend across Syria and represent a qualitative shift in infrastructure and economic life”, Talal al-Hilali, head of the Syrian Investment Authority, said during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Damascus. Syria’s new authorities have worked to attract investment for the reconstruction of infrastructure across the country after the US and the European Union lifted sanctions on Syria in the wake of al-Assad’s ouster. Other major developments on the investment front include the $2bn Damascus Towers project for residential high rises, signed with the Italian-based company UBAKO; a $500m deal for the Baramkeh Towers project, also in Damascus; and another $60m agreement for Baramkeh Mall.

Article: Early in her career, Cooke edited many of the films her husband directed with his brother, Joel (the renowned duo often simply referred to as the “Coen Brothers”), including “The Big Lebowski” and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” But for this film she joined her spouse in the writers’ room. In addition to their films, their unique relationship has also made headlines: Cooke is a lesbian, Coen is straight, they share two children and have been in a platonic union for more than 30 years. Writer Tricia Cooke, actor Margaret Qualley and writer/director Ethan Coen on the set of "Honey Don't!" Karen Kuehn / Courtesy Focus Features Cooke said that in “Honey Don’t!” which her husband directed, it was her mission to make lesbian protagonists visible within the noir genre. But, she added, “I couldn’t think of any noir genre movies that were lesbian or queer-themed.” Cooke was also inspired by the butch-femme dynamic and wanted to “switch the gender norms” in “Honey Don’t!” “Instead of it being like the masculine male detective, it would be great if the very feminine character was the detective, and the more butch character was the femme fatale,” she said of her initial thought process. Aubrey Plaza stars as MG Falcone and Margaret Qualley as Honey O’Donahue in "Honey Don't!" Courtesy Focus Features The main character also uses her feminine wiles, charisma and flowery dresses to disarm her opponents and catch them off guard to her benefit, so she can hit them hard with her sharp investigative skills. Cooke said the reverend’s sex scenes were meant to be a bit ridiculous, while the scenes between Honey and MG were intended to be sexy, with the first of their steamy scenes inspired by “Basic Instinct.” “We wanted them to feel sexual tension from the beginning, like it was a big spark in both of their lives,” Cooke said. Drew Devlin in "Honey Don't!" Courtesy Focus Features As for the film’s location, Cooke, who was raised in Southern California, said she and Coen wanted to deviate from the typically grim environments of noir films and use the backdrop of sun-drenched Bakersfield. But while the film’s opening was actually shot in Bakersfield, most of the film was shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the Coen Brothers shot “True Grit” and “No Country for Old Men.” Cooke noted that some of Albuquerque’s background terrain, such as its mountains, had to be edited out. With “Honey Don’t” about to hit theaters, Cooke and Coen are now working on the final installment of their sapphic trilogy: “Go Beavers.” Cooke said the script is in its early stages and is about “a crew team who gets together for their reunion, and they start dying off one by one.” However, Cooke noted, she’s not a fan of horror and is hoping to steer the story in a different direction, one that is specifically inspired by the 1971 Australian outback survival film “Walkabout.” “That film is whoa, psychedelic.

Article: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under pressure from all sides Sunday as his controversial plan to seize Gaza City drew backlash inside his government and on the streets of Israel, while malnutrition deaths in the Gaza Strip continued to climb. Netanyahu only conceded there was “deprivation” in Gaza, but said “no one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war” if Israel was implementing a “starvation policy.” Netanyahu went on to defend the new military offensive, saying Israel had “no choice” but to “finish the job” and “defeat Hamas,” while claiming that "hundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza." But his critics on the left say his proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a “foolish” half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it. “In your own words, you admitted that the prime minister’s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,” Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. “You also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.” The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting later Sunday to discuss Israel's proposed offensive, which has been condemned by Britain, France, Australia and other Western governments. James Kariuki, the U.K.'s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan "will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza." It comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May. The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Thursday that at least 99 people in Gaza, including 29 children under age 5, have died from malnutrition this year, noting the real toll was most likely higher. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through air drops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave’s population of 2 million people. We want international protection.” With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during airdrops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office. The plan, which Netanyahu’s government announced Friday, outlines five goals for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing “an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.” Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hardliners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Center, said the plan was full of “hollow slogans.” “There is a very common slogan: ‘We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,’” he said. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.” Netanyahu said Sunday that his goal was to get the hostages out alive and recover the remains of those had had died. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to “Arab forces,” adding Sunday that "several candidates" are being looked at for the establishment of a new "transitional authority." He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday sought to defend a new military offensive in one of Gaza’s most populated areas amid growing condemnation at home and abroad, declaring that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” He spoke to foreign media minutes before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Gaza. Notably, Netanyahu said he has directed Israel’s military in recent days to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during 22 months of war. He also pushed back against what he called a “global campaign of lies” — and said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of Israel’s strongest backers, had “buckled under” by announcing that Germany won’t authorize exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice. The prime minister, who has asserted that there is “no starvation in Gaza,” did acknowledge hunger there, saying, “there was a problem with deprivation, no question about it.” Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites, he said, but gave no details. More Palestinians killed as they seek aid At least 26 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said, as families of Israeli hostages called for a general strike to protest Netanyahu’s plans to expand military operations in Gaza City. The dead included 15 killed while waiting for aid trucks close to the newly built Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital. WATCH: Security contractor says he witnessed ‘barbaric’ and un-American tactics at Gaza aid sites A further six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and Shifa hospital in Gaza City. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before the fire was aimed toward crowds of aid-seekers trying to reach a food distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but its early operations have been marred by deaths and chaos, with aid-seekers coming under gunfire near routes leading to the sites. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today and these incidents appear to be linked to crowds trying to loot aid convoy.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving Israeli troops near central Gaza aid sites. Seven people were killed in airstrikes, local hospitals said — three people near the fishermen’s port in Gaza City and four people, two of them children, in a strike that hit a tent in Khan Younis. WATCH: Understanding the stages of starvation A total of 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since late June when the ministry started to count that age category, it said. Also Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz toured the northern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where about 40,000 Palestinians have been driven from their homes this year in the West Bank’s largest displacement since Israel captured the territory in 1967. Katz said the military would remain in the area’s refugee camps at least until the end of the year, and said the number of warnings about attacks against Israelis in the West Bank had decreased by 80% since the operation began in January.

Article: It's too soon for President Donald Trump 's newest tariff rates to show up in the numbers just yet, but we'll be watching for any inflation signs from the levies already in place. The CPI and PPI arrive after a weak July jobs report — and the accompanying downward revisions to the prior two-month totals — that caused investors to dramatically reconsider the health of the U.S. Traders went from betting the Fed will keep rates steady again in September — thanks to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell throwing cold water on the idea at the Fed's July meeting — to overwhelmingly pricing in a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Now comes the CPI and PPI, which shine a light on the price-stability piece of the Fed's mandate and, in particular, the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on the rate of inflation. In the June CPI report, inflation picked up to 2.7% overall and 2.9%, when excluding the more volatile food and energy prices, from the May rates of 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively. "We see the biggest risk to markets in the [second half of the year] from a reacceleration in both goods and service inflation, leading the Fed to remain on hold and putting upward pressure on interest rates," strategists at Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core CPI is projected to rise 0.3% month over month and 3.1% on a 12-month basis; that would be an acceleration from 0.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in June. For the PPI, which is seen as a leading indicator for the CPI because it measures what companies pay for their own inputs like steel, the consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain after being flat in June, according to Dow Jones. While it's good to get another month's worth of data, the CPI and PPI for July won't answer that question entirely, in part because tariff levels are still evolving, and in part because businesses that may eventually raise prices are still working through inventory accumulated before duty rates went up. However, at least for Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, he told CNBC last week that he's getting more comfortable with the idea of cutting rates without knowing the full effect of tariffs. "There's a bunch of data that I know and that I've got confidence in, and there's data that I don't know and we're not going to know for a while," Kashkari said Wednesday on "Squawk Box." "The data that I think we know is that the economy is slowing. All of that suggests the real underlying economy is slowing." He continued, "The part I don't have confidence in yet is, what are the ultimate effects of tariffs going to be on inflation? Other data: While the CPI and PPI are the biggest data points of the week, there are a few other releases that the market will be watching due to the heightened focus on the health of the economy post-jobs report. On Thursday morning, we'll get the weekly initial jobless claims report — a measure of both first-time unemployment insurance filings, which can be used to gauge layoff activity among employers, and so-called continuing claims, which offer insights into how easily people who lose their jobs can find a new gig.

Article: 'The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder' bosses reveal which celeb they really want as a guest star Season 3 of "The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder" mixes heart and humor with big guest stars! The series stars Kyla Pratt (Penny Proud), Tommy Davidson (Oscar Proud), Paula Jai Parker (Trudy Proud), JoMarie Payton (Suga Mama), Cedric the Entertainer (Uncle Bobby), Karen Malina White (Dijonay Jones), Soleil Moon Frye (Zoey Howzer), Alisa Reyes (LaCienega Boulevardez), Carlos Mencia (Felix Boulevardez), Alvaro Gutierrez (Papi), Raquel Lee Bolleau (Nubia Gross), Marcus T. So, you know, we start in Paris and we go through Brazil, Nairobi, and it was important to tell that story because, A) it was good to see the family kind of unified to take this adventure, and then B) because you get to see a spectrum of blackness all around the world," said Smith. "That's the thing that sort of hangs around our necks as Black people, because we still feel the effects of it to this day, because there's every shade of African American in this country, or in the world, certainly. And for those who aren't aware of what it is, they will be aware after this." The show mixes heart and humor with each episode, a balance that Smith and Farquhar believe is a reason for its success. "I think what's great about this show is we can actually go from a fun romp where we take you around the world with lots of comedy, you know, a super spy episode, and then tackle some real politics, some real issues within our community," Smith explained. "It allows us to be very intimate and very intentional in terms of the emotions we want to get across." Season three features some notable names as guest stars, including Janelle James, Sanaa Lathan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Lynn Whitfield, Adrienne Warren, Kirk Franklin, and Bubba Wallace.

Pritzker — whose state has become a haven for Texas Democrats protesting the GOP-led effort — rejected the idea that congressional maps in Illinois are politically gerrymandered, arguing that the maps were redrawn after the census, which, he said, is "how it's done in this country."

Article: 5 on Truth Social of a bloodied Edward Coristine, known by his LinkedIn handle of “ Big Balls .” After a group of teenagers severely beat a prominent employee of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency in an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., Trump threatened a federal takeover of the nation’s capital. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote. “Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. Data shows that in recent years, the district has had a significant crime problem, but offenses such as homicide, gun-related and aggravated assault, carjacking, vehicle theft, robbery and sexual assault have declined from COVID-19-era peaks. While the home rule law granted the district significant autonomy for local governance, the city still answers to Congress on certain matters, including budgetary oversight and the ability to overturn local legislation. history, members of Congress have interfered in city affairs to fiddle with everything from how long pools are open to banning the city from using its own tax money for a needle exchange program,” said George Derek Musgrove, a University of Maryland-Baltimore County historian. It would have to act to reclaim that authority, or to delegate it to another entity, like the executive branch.” Congress’ Republican majorities have so far supported Trump’s agenda with near-unanimity, but a repeal of home rule isn’t a sure thing. in order for him to wipe out its Democratic leadership and replace it with people who are loyal only to him, that strikes me as precisely what the framers did not want.” Short of a law, the president has other ways to exert influence in the district, including the authority to mobilize the D.C. The Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control over the city’s police department in an emergency — something Trump threatened to do in 2020 amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. “…Frankly, the federal government should take over control and management of Washington, D.C.” During a July 2024 Florida campaign rally, Trump promised to “take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C., and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.” Trump echoed this in February, again focusing on blight and crime: “I think the federal government should take over the governance of D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.” It mandates beautification efforts such as graffiti removal and enhanced park maintenance, and it includes provisions to address violent crime and issues related to homelessness. In 1874, local conservatives angry about voting rights for local Black and working-class white residents teamed up with opponents of Reconstruction-era voting in the South and some of their Northern allies to roll back democratic laws in the district, Musgrove said.

Article: Ski jumping faces more controversy with six months to go until the Winter Olympics after the first high-level competition of the new season saw numerous athletes disqualified over ill-fitting suits. The governing body says it's “perfectly normal.” The ski jumping world was rocked in March by the discovery of illegally altered suits on the Norwegian team at the world championships. In Saturday's first event of the 2025-26 season — a summer Grand Prix event on an artificial surface in France — six male ski jumpers were disqualified because of suit issues such as waist size and three more were “not permitted to start.” Another jumper from Japan was blocked from competing as the Grand Prix continued Sunday. The federation told The Associated Press in an e-mailed statement that it's treating the spate of disqualifications as the natural result of tightening up the rules after the Norwegian suit scandal. “It’s also important to highlight that these disqualifications are clearly a result of technical inadequacies — there’s no sign whatsoever of ill intent from the teams.” FIS indicated that a further nine men and five women didn't compete following a “technical approval” process, though it wasn't clear if all of those cases involved their suits.

ATLANTA -- A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday.

Article: The White House stepped up pressure against Harvard Friday, adding a new investigation into the university’s patents and renewing a host of claims that the university is unfit to host international students. The two sides have been working to resolve their differences in recent weeks, but a court motion filed by the government on Friday in a dispute over international students suggested there is still deep acrimony. The motion accuses Harvard of failure to control crime, and claims that Harvard’s leadership has “shown itself to be incapable of properly hosting, monitoring, disciplining, and reporting on its foreign students.” On the same day, Commerce Secretary Howard W. President Trump issued a directive that would require colleges and universities to submit reams of new data on students to check whether they are complying with a Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action. In the court case involving Harvard, the Justice Department was asking a judge to throw out one of two pending lawsuits filed by Harvard against the administration, this one involving the right of the nation’s oldest university’s right to host international students. When Judge Allison Burroughs of federal court in Boston temporarily blocked the administration action, the White House countered in June by issuing a proclamation blocking international students that invoked a different provision of law. It has no effect on the university’s lawsuit against the administration about research funding cuts, a case that focuses heavily on constitutional and procedural concerns.) The government’s effort could have disrupted the lives of about 5,000 international students attending Harvard last spring, another 2,000 recent graduates, as well as a new cohort of students who plan to arrive this fall. The university has accused the government of retaliating against it for its refusal to bend to the White House’s efforts to control the university’s “governance, curriculum and the ideology of faculty and students.” In its filing Friday, the administration denied that contention. The university’s student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, has reported that the campus police responded to nearly twice as many crimes on campus in 2023 as in 2021, mostly over reports of stolen electric bikes and scooters. In a statement, Harvard said the motion on Friday “has no impact on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and scholars.” “The university will continue to defend its rights — and the rights of its students and scholars,” the statement added. In a separate move on Friday, the administration added to its pressure campaign against Harvard when the Commerce Department said it would investigate whether the university was complying with federal laws and regulations around intellectual property that emerge from government-backed research. Lutnick did not include any evidence showing that Harvard, whose researchers generally secure scores of patents each year, had violated the law, but he said that the Commerce Department thought that the university had “failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer.” Patents can be extraordinarily lucrative for research universities, with their collective values climbing far into the millions of dollars. In a statement on Friday, Harvard blasted the Commerce Department’s letter as “unprecedented” and “yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.” “Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are lifesaving and industry-redefining,” the university said, adding that it was “fully committed” to complying with federal law.

Article: That's how I felt about last week where the market took a huge number of stocks out and shot them, including some of ours — more on that when we get to Thursday's Monthly Meeting for Club subscribers — but the sellers could not stop Apple, the most unlikely of winners for this moment, and one that defined last week's tape. Case in point: the traditional market-cap weighed S & P 500 climbed 2.4% over the past week while a modified version of the index that assigns each company the same influence, known as the equal-weight S & P 500 , advanced merely 0.8%. First, good short-sellers like to go after either the most white hot of companies — in the current moment, that's a name like Palantir — or companies with a stock that is already rolling over, like that of Apple. Announced to much fanfare last June, its suite of AI software tools dubbed Apple Intelligence is widely ridiculed and key features like an AI upgrade of Siri have been delayed. We also see the headlines about the company losing people who might, or might not, be working on AI, which may be the reason they seemingly have no AI strategy. We in the media cannot resist asking business leaders questions like, "How are you using AI?" And we ask it to any CEO, no matter how clueless they may be about AI and how little they might need AI. Most of the time their answers sound rehearsed, kind of like when I delivered my lines playing Lieutenant Rooney in "Arsenic and Old Lace" as a junior in high school. But that route may no longer be open to them because of a crucial win by the Biden-era Justice Department against Alphabet last year, one where a federal judge deemed Alphabet and its search-engine business violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws monopolies. At one point, Apple might have been waiting for any of the generative AI-infused search engines to come along and pay them $20 billion to do the same thing to block any other comer. Mainly they know that it doesn't have a strategy — in itself a great reason to short it — and second, they know it isn't going to get anyone to pay it for sending Safari users to their AI bot. I think many big short-sellers have also been betting against Apple precisely because that remedy ruling is imminent and the ruling could mean that Apple could immediately lose that $20 billion from Google. I know it because I begged them to buy Netflix several times when the putative target was worth about $25 billion to $50 billion, and Apple's management seemed determined to rule that out along with anything else that came to mind. Nevertheless, the combination of not getting paid the $20 billion from Google — and perhaps paying an outrageous amount to buy Perplexity outright — is not something you want to buy the stock of Apple for. Apple's key supplier Foxconn first started making iPhones in India in 2019 and some of the supply-chain issues that arose during the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to additional emphasis being placed on India as a production hub. Then it became evident that Trump didn't like that India had become somewhat of a weird ally/client state of Russia because of Russian oil, and that the president did not want any iPhones made anywhere but the U.S. When I interviewed Cook and asked him about his relationship with Trump after Trump had called him out for doing business in India, he said the relationship was a good one. Sure, you may not think it matters and it is awfully difficult even for the government to spend $600 billion unless the money goes to the Pentagon or the interest on the national debt. Oh, and if you needed one more reason to be short: Apple had a very good last quarter, but it was presumed that the success of the quarter came from pull-through to beat the tariffs and it wasn't regarded as consequential. So, let's wrap up the metaphor: Apple has no AI strategy and even if it gets one, it will have to pay through the noise for it, perhaps endlessly, as you need all the chips that fellow Club name Nvidia makes to have a winning AI offering. I've had an own-don't-trade philosophy toward Apple for ages but even I was struck about the run from $210 a share to $220 in after-hours trading early last week when Trump blessed Apple's largesse. All of this occurred at a time that most of the market was rolling over except, weirdly, medical technology names — check out Becton Dickinson , Medtronic and our Abbott Labs — and some scattered retailers, including Club-owned TJX Companies , a heavily shorted stock for no reason other than the chart.

Article: In a month that’s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger’s highly anticipated horror film “Weapons” did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. “Both are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.” “Weapons” transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The film is Cregger’s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, “Barbarian.” That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre. “It starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.” The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. “Weapons ”also joins a stream of successful horror movies this year, its opening numbers coming in just behind “Final Destination: Bloodlines” and “Sinners.” With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S.

Article: Police in London on Saturday arrested 522 people who were protesting against the United Kingdom’s recent decision to ban the group Palestine Action, a tally thought to include the highest-ever recorded at a single protest in the British capital. The Metropolitan Police on Sunday updated its previous arrest tally of 466 and said that all but one of the 522 arrests took place at a protest in central London’s Parliament Square and were for displaying placards backing Palestine Action. The other arrest for the same offence took place at nearby Russell Square as thousands rallied at a Palestine Coalition march demonstrating against Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed at least 61,430 people and wounded 153, 213. The protests were the latest in a series of rallies denouncing the British government’s ban of Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act 2000 on July 5, days after the group took responsibility for a break-in at an air force base in southern England that caused an estimated 7 million pounds ($9.4m) of damage to two aircraft. Huda Ammori, cofounder of Palestine Action, said ahead of Saturday’s protests that they would “go down in our country’s history as a momentous act of collective defiance of an unprecedented attack on our fundamental freedoms”. “If this was happening in another country, the UK government would be voicing grave concerns about freedom of speech and human rights,” Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director Areeba Hamid said on Saturday. Police across the UK have made scores of similar arrests since July 5, when being a member of Palestine Action or supporting the group became a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Police announced this week that the first three people had been charged in the English and Welsh criminal justice system with such backing following their arrests at a July 5 demonstration. In its update on Sunday, the Met revealed a further 26 case files following other arrests on that day are due to be submitted to prosecutors “imminently” and that more would follow related to later protests. The protesters, who planned to march to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s residence in Downing Street for a rally, include Noga Guttman, a cousin of 24-year-old captive Evyatar David, who featured in a video that enraged Israelis when it was released by Hamas last week. “We are united in one clear and urgent demand: the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,” Stop the Hate, a coalition of groups organising the march, said in a statement.

Article: Netanyahu defends Gaza plans as Israel heavily criticised at UN Security Council 11 minutes ago Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save Reuters UN ambassadors have condemned Israel's plans to "take control" of Gaza City as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted it was the "best way" to end the war. During a press conference, which Netanyahu said was intended to "puncture the lies", the Israeli leader said the planned offensive would move "fairly quickly" and would "free Gaza from Hamas". Meanwhile, Israel came under heavy criticism at an emergency meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, with the UK, France and others warning the plan risked "violating international humanitarian law". Along with Denmark, Greece and Slovenia, they called for the plan to be reversed, adding it would "do nothing to secure the return of hostages and risks further endangering their lives". UN Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenca told the meeting: "If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction." Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across Israel to oppose the government's plan, fearing it puts the lives of hostages at risk.

Article: A senior United Nations official has warned the UN Security Council (UNSC) that Israel’s plan to seize Gaza City risked “another calamity” in the Gaza Strip with far-reaching consequences, as five more people in Gaza reportedly died from starvation – bringing the overall toll to 217, including 100 children. UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas Miroslav Jenca on Sunday told an emergency weekend meeting that if implemented, the plan could result in the displacement of all civilians from Gaza City by October 7, 2025, affecting some 800,000 people, many of them already previously displaced. Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the UNSC that Israel was aiming for “the destruction of the Palestinian people through forced transfer and massacres to facilitate its annexation of our land”. Advertisement France’s Deputy Permanent UN Representative Jay Dharmadhikari condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the plan, which he said would have “dramatic humanitarian consequences” for civilians already “living in horrifying conditions”. In a separate statement, the foreign ministers of Spain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Portugal and Slovenia warned that Israel seizing Gaza City would be “a major obstacle to implementing the two-state solution, the only path towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace”. Israel to ‘finish the job’ in Gaza Despite the international backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained defiant over the plan to seize Gaza’s largest urban centre, which was approved by Israel’s security cabinet on Friday. “I don’t want to talk about exact timetables, but we’re talking in terms of a fairly short timetable because we want to bring the war to an end.” He said Israel had “no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas”, given the group’s refusal to lay down its arms. Netanyahu said the military had been given the green light to “dismantle” what he described as two remaining Hamas strongholds: Gaza City in the north and al-Mawasi further to the south. “We will do so by first enabling the civilian population to safely leave the combat areas to designated safe zones.” While the prime minister stressed that these “safe zones” would be given “ample food, water, and medical care”, guards at the controversial Israel- and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), purportedly established to deliver aid to the starving Palestinian population, have routinely opened fire on the aid seekers, killing dozens at a time. ‘Unacceptable catastrophe’ The director of the coordination division at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that the “unacceptable catastrophe” unfolding in Gaza must be brought to an end as he addressed the UN Security Council via videolink on Sunday. Ramesh Rajasingham expressed concern over “the prolonged conflict, the reports of atrocities and further human toll that is likely to unfold following the government of Israel’s decision to expand military operations in Gaza”. Ahmad Alhendawi, Save the Children International’s director for the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, told Al Jazeera that his team on the ground was seeing an “exponential increase” in the number of malnutrition cases, with effects that can “span generations”.

Article: What to know about how Trump's judicial picks could reshape abortion rights for decades CHICAGO -- A review by The Associated Press shows that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to the federal courts have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. While Trump has said issues related to abortion should be left to the states, the nominees, with lifetime appointments, would be in position to roll back abortion rights long after Trump leaves the White House. In the years before his most recent presidential campaign, Trump had voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks in pregnancy and said he might support a national ban around 15 weeks. A nominee from Tennessee said abortion deserves special scrutiny because "this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life." One from Missouri spread misinformation about medication abortion, including that it "starves the baby to death in the womb" in a lawsuit aiming to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial appointments "are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement." "It's a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash," she said. The nominees represent Trump's 'promises' to Americans, White House says Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said "every nominee of the President represents his promises to the American people and aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling." "The Democrats' extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump's commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion," Fields said in a statement to the AP. Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time "This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion, saying he's going to leave it to the states, while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," said Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All.

Article: The sheriff of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, was arrested Friday by the FBI for allegedly pressuring a national cannabis retailer trying to do business in Boston into letting him buy $50,000 worth of stock before the firm went public. Steven Tompkins, the sheriff of Suffolk County, which encompasses Boston, Chelsea and Revere, was taken into custody in Florida and will appear in federal court in Boston at a later date, prosecutors said in a statement. Advertisement “We believe what the Sheriff saw as an easy way to make a quick buck on the sly is clear cut corruption under federal law,” Ted Docks, FBI special agent in charge of the Boston division, said in a statement. Public servants must be held to the highest of ethical standards, and those falling short will be rooted out.” The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment, unsealed Friday morning, does not name the cannabis company in question but identifies it as a national cannabis cultivation and retail company that operated dispensaries in Massachusetts as well as several other states. Advertisement At the time of the company’s founding, the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission was charged with overseeing the regulation and licensing of companies looking to sell cannabis in the state, where recreational marijuana was legalized in 2016. But as the company sought to obtain its license — between 2020 and July 2023 — Tompkins allegedly tried to pressure the owner to sell him stock in the company before it went public. Advertisement The owner of the company eventually relented and agreed to sell shares in the company to Tompkins while it was still private, according to the indictment, fearing that Tompkins would wield his position as sheriff to jeopardize the company’s license. Between around May 2022 and July 2023, fearing that Tompkins would terminate his office’s partnership with the company, the owner refunded the $50,000 to Tompkins through five checks, the indictment claims.

In response, a Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that "cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them." Nvidia on Tuesday similarly rejected Chinese accusations that its AI chips include a hardware function that could remotely deactivate the chips, also known as a "kill switch." Tensions between the U.S. Nvidia's H20 chips — a less-advanced semiconductor compared to its flagship H100 and B100 chips, for example — were developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market after initial export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023. export controls on some Nvidia chips are rooted in national security concerns that Beijing could use the more advanced chips to gain an advantage broadly in AI, as well as in its military applications.

Article: Netanyahu defends new military offensive in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his country's planned military takeover of Gaza City and claimed once again that there is no starvation in Gaza. JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel "has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" of Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a "global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a global platform for outrage but little action on the war. SEE ALSO | 'Palestinian Pele' killed while awaiting aid, soccer association says He said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of Israel's strongest backers, had "buckled under" the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to "bring in more foreign journalists" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. We have frankly run out of words to describe it." More Palestinians killed as they seek aid At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. "But I have no other choice to feed the kids." Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: "There were no incidents at or near our sites today." Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites. Seven people were killed in airstrikes, local hospitals said - three near the fishermen's port in Gaza City and four, two of them children, in a tent in Khan Younis. Labor strike urged in Israel over looming offensive Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations in Gaza City, fearing it will endanger their loved ones.

The template has inspired more than 78,000 videos on TikTok, where people use it to represent spamming actions like skipping songs, annoying their friends or fast-forwarding through workplace compliance trainings. A lizard mashup with the 2010 classic “Like A G6” accrued more than 12 million views, and others set to hits like Eminem’s “Rap God,” Cardi B’s “WAP” and AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” also got millions of views each.

The film is Cregger’s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, “Barbarian.” That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre. “It starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.” The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. “Weapons ”also joins a stream of successful horror movies this year, its opening numbers coming in just behind “Final Destination: Bloodlines” and “Sinners.” Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S.

Article: In response, Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: "The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people." Trump-Putin meeting spikes worries Saturday's statement by top European leaders came after the White House confirmed the U.S. president was willing to grant Putin the one-on-one meeting Russia has long pushed for, and suggestions from Trump that a peace deal could include "some swapping of territories." That raised fears that Kyiv may be pressured into giving up land or accepting other curbs on its sovereignty. A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they aren't allowed to speak publicly, told The Associated Press that Trump remained open to a trilateral summit with both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, but for now, he will have a bilateral meeting requested by Putin. The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace. Calls for a lasting peace deal Saturday's statement, signed by the president of the European Union and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the UK, stressed the need for a "just and lasting peace" for Kyiv, including "robust and credible" security guarantees. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News on Sunday that a good deal would mean preventing an emboldened Russia, and aggressors elsewhere, from trying to once again redraw borders by force. I have every confidence in the world that (President Trump) is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he's going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably," he said. He argued that "Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian" soldier, but said the West should give Kyiv robust security guarantees, keep some of its forces on the ground "as trip wires," and keep arming Ukraine "so that Russia will be deterred by the most lethal army on the continent of Europe." A fruitless push toward a truce A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. Trump also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Mark Galeotti, a British expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, says Moscow's tactic of encircling towns in eastern Ukraine has brought a string of territorial gains for Russia, and Putin "does not appear to feel under pressure." For the Kremlin, "further delaying any more serious U.S. Zelenskyy rules out giving up territory Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine "will not give Russia any awards for what it has done" and that "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier." Ukrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily.

Article: Bowen: Israeli settlers intensify campaign to drive out West Bank Palestinians 11 minutes ago Share Save Jeremy Bowen International editor, reporting from the occupied West Bank Share Save Oren Rosenfeld/BBC Meir Simcha agreed to talk, but he wanted to do it somewhere special, because for him, this is a special time. In a place where nation, religion and war are linked inextricably with politics and the possession of land, Simcha chose a patch of shade under a fig tree next to a spring of fresh water. Simcha is the leader of a group of Jewish settlers steadily transforming a big stretch of the rolling terrain south of Hebron in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It was a small oasis at the foot of a steep, arid, rocky slope and the location, if not our conversation, felt peaceful in a way that the West Bank rarely does these days. The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea started well over a century ago when Zionists from Europe began to buy land to set up communities in Palestine. The consequences of the last 22 months of war, and however more months are left before a ceasefire, threaten to spread across years and generations, just like the Middle East war in 1967, when Israel captured Gaza from Egypt and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan. The enemy in our land lost hope to stay here, says Meir Simcha Evidence based on statements by ministers, influential local leaders like Simcha and accounts by witnesses on the ground reveal that the pressure is part of a wider agenda, to accelerate the spread of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to extinguish any lingering hopes of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Palestinians and human rights groups also accuse the Israeli security forces of failing in their legal duty as occupiers to protect Palestinians as well as their own citizens - not just turning a blind eye to settler attacks, but even joining in. Israel's rejects the ICJ's view and claims that the Geneva Conventions forbidding settlement in occupied territories do not apply - a view disputed by many of its own allies as well as international lawyers. In the shade of the fig tree, Simcha denied all suggestions he had attacked Palestinians, as he celebrated the fact that most of the Arab farmers who used to graze their animals on the hills he has seized and tend their olives in the valleys had gone. I care about my people." Simcha says the Palestinians who left villages and farms near the hilltops he has claimed simply realised that God intended the land for Jews, not for them. A statement issued by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said: "We are deeply troubled by alleged widespread intimidation, violence, land dispossession, destruction of livelihoods and the resulting forcible displacement of communities, and we fear this is severing Palestinians from their land and undermining their food security. "The alleged acts of violence, destruction of property, and denial of access to land and resources appear to constitute a systemic pattern of human rights violations." Simcha has a plan to dig a swimming pool at the base of the spring where we sat to talk. When I met him first, not long after Hamas burst through Israel's border defences on 7 October 2023, he lived in a small group of isolated caravans on a hilltop overlooking the Judean desert as it sweeps down to the Dead Sea. But now men like Simcha are at the centre of events, with their leaders in the cabinet, leading the charge, married, older, thinking not just about swimming pools for their children but of victory over the Palestinians, once and for all, and everlasting Jewish possession of the land. Over the last almost 60 years, successive Israeli governments and some wealthy sympathisers have invested vast amounts of money and energy to get to the point where around 700,000 Israeli Jews live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The bigger settlements look like small towns, and the West Bank is carved into sections by a network of roads and tunnels built by Israel that are as much about staking an immovable claim to the land as they are about traffic management. In many parts of the West Bank, you just do not see them anymore, especially in places like the settlements east of Shiloh on the road to Nablus, where small groups of shacks and caravans on hilltops have connected up into sprawling residential hubs linked by sinuous road networks. Motaz Tafsha, mayor of West Bank town Sinjel: "They want to take our land, and they have the green light" When first I reported on settlements, Israeli leaders would often say that national security depended on them. Just like the kibbutz movement of collective farms in the 1920s and 1930s inside present-day Israel, settlements in the occupied territories after 1967 were strategically placed as a first line of defence. Trading land taken by Israel in 1967 for peace with Palestinians who wanted it for a state was at the heart of the Oslo peace process that ended in violence but provided a false dawn of hope in the 1990s. There were headlines around the world when, after months of secret negotiations in Norway in 1993, there was a handshake on the White House lawn between Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. After a final disastrous summit at Camp David in 2000, the hopes of 1993 were replaced by the deadly violence of a Palestinian uprising and a massive military response from Israel. Among religious Zionists in Israel, the victory in 1967 had supercharged a wave of messianism - the belief that a divine being was coming who would redeem the Jewish people. During his first interrogation by the Israeli security service, Shin Bet, he asked for a drink so he could toast the fact that he had saved the Jewish people from a disastrous path that denied the will of God. They believe the victory in 1967 was a miracle granted by God, that restored to the Jewish people the ancestral lands that he had given them in the mountain heartland of Judea and Samaria - the area that much of the rest of the world calls the West Bank. Last summer, the Minister for Settlements and National Missions, Orit Strock, put it like this to a sympathetic audience at an outpost in the Hebron hills, the area where Simcha operates. Oren Rosenfeld/BBC Police guard a digger extending the settlement of Carmel near Umm al-Khair, in the southern West Bank At a ceremony in one of them in the south Hebron Hills in April this year, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose powers over the running of the occupation also make him something like the governor of the West Bank, donated 19 all-terrain vehicles to the settlers. On 28 July this year, Yinon Levi fired a bullet that killed Odeh Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist, during a disturbance in the West Bank village of Umm al-Khair. Oren Rosenfeld/BBC The settlement movement in the West Bank has powered ahead since 7 October, under the direction of hardline Jewish nationalists in the cabinet, men like Itamar Ben Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, who is Strock's leader in the Religious Zionist Party. The two ministers are very different people to the secular politicians - retired generals like Yigal Allon from the Israeli left and Ariel Sharon from the right - two men who drove the settlement movement forward in its first two decades after 1967. So that settler on the hilltop nearby a Palestinian herding community that was beating them up and throwing stones for the past two three or four years, trying to get him out, now is the soldier or the officer in uniform with a gun responsible for the area. "So when he comes to a Palestinian and says, 'you have 24 hours to pack up and leave or I'm going to shoot you,' the Palestinian knows there is nothing to protect him." Oren Rosenfeld/BBC

Article: United States President Donald Trump has pledged to evict homeless people from the nation’s capital, after days of musing about taking federal control of Washington, DC, where he has falsely suggested crime is on the rise. It’s all going to happen very fast.” The announcement comes after Trump earlier this week threatened to deploy the National Guard as part of a crackdown on what he falsely says is rising crime in Washington, DC. “I’m going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” The White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from the city. According to the Community Partnership, an organisation working to reduce homelessness in Washington, DC, on any given night, there are 3,782 single people experiencing homelessness in the city of about 700,000 people. Advertisement A White House official said on Friday that more federal law enforcement officers were being deployed in the city following a violent attack on a young Trump administration staffer, which angered the president. Crime in DC at ‘a 30-year low’ Alleged crimes investigated by federal agents on Friday night included “multiple persons carrying a pistol without license”, motorists driving on suspended licences, and dirt bike riding, according to a White House official on Sunday. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low,” Bowser said on US media MSNBC’s news segment The Weekend. The city’s police department reports that violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 was down by 26 percent in Washington, DC, compared with last year, while overall crime was down about 7 percent. Trump’s threat to send in the National Guard comes weeks after he deployed California’s military reserve force into Los Angeles to quell protests over immigration raids, despite objections from local leaders and law enforcement. The US Congress has control of Washington, DC’s budget after the district was established in 1790 with land from neighbouring Virginia and Maryland, but resident voters elect a mayor and the City Council.

James Kariuki, the U.K.’s deputy permanent representative to the U.N., called on Israel to reverse its decision, saying the plan “will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.” Israel’s restrictions on accessing Gaza have forced countries to take to the skies, but doctors on the ground warn aid drops are “causing havoc.” are “causing havoc.” An NBC News analysis of satellite imagery and social media videos reveals Israel’s network of buffer zones outside its borders with Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. “Governor Abbott is the joke,” Pritzker, a Democrat, told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that aired Sunday in response to Abbott calling Illinois’ congressional map a “joke.” “He’s the one who is attempting mid-decade here — at a time when, frankly, all of us are concerned about the future of democracy.

Article: Netanyahu defends Israel's plan to seize Gaza City, despite global condemnation toggle caption Abir Sultan/AFP via Getty Images Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that his plan to seize control of Gaza City and the remaining sliver of Gaza not already under Israeli control will involve displacing the population and taking control of the entire Gaza Strip. Sponsor Message The families of hostages held in Gaza are also denouncing the move, demanding Netanyahu's government strike a ceasefire deal with Hamas that frees the 50 or so hostages still held by militants, around 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. "Contrary to false claims, this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily," he said in his first public comments since Israel's Security Cabinet approved the plan. He said Israel will do so by enabling people "to safely leave the combat areas to designated safe zones." He said that there they would be given "ample food, water and medical care." He did not say how Gaza's population of 2 million people would be moved to these areas safely, where these zones would be, if they would be encircled by Israeli troops or any other details on the plan.

He spoke to reporters as he stood before pictures of famished children in Gaza with the words "fake" on them, claiming there was no starvation and that such reports are "malignant lies." NPR's own reporting, experts on famine and visiting physicians on the ground have all confirmed severe malnutrition and starvation among the population. "Hospitals are not protected, doctors have been killed or detained, and facilities are working without sufficient medical supplies." In less than two years of war, Israeli strikes have killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Nearly 1,800 people have been killed and nearly 13,000 wounded while trying to get food aid in the last few weeks, most killed by Israeli forces, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

On Sunday, foreign affairs ministers from Spain, Portugal, Norway and other European countries signed a joint letter bashing Israel's plan, saying it would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, endanger the remaining hostages and "lead to an unacceptable high toll of deaths and the forced displacement of nearly one million Palestinian civilians." Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey also condemned Israel's plan. interim ambassador to the U.N., said during the Security Council meeting Sunday that "Israel has a right to decide what is necessary for its security, and what measures are appropriate to end the threat posed by Hamas and other similar groups." Sponsor Message Shea added: "The simple truth is that this war could end today if Hamas would let the hostages and all of Gaza go free." Netanyahu's office said on Sunday that the prime minister spoke to President Trump about the plan to seize control of Gaza City and thanked Trump "for his steadfast support for Israel since the start of the war." Last week, when asked about a possible plan by Israel to occupy all of Gaza, Trump said that was "pretty much up to Israel."

Article: -- A Colorado prison was evacuated as one of the largest wildfires in state history continued to grow, and officials warned residents of remote areas to be ready to leave Sunday as gusty winds and low humidity fed the flames. Evacuation orders were already in place for mountain communities as the Lee Fire charred more than 167 square miles (433 square kilometers) across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties, with just 6% containment. The Lee Fire, churning through trees and brush about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Denver, is now the sixth-largest single fire in the state’s history, according to the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. In Southern California, crews reached 62% containment on the 8-square-mile (20-square-kilometer) Canyon Fire that forced evacuations and destroyed seven structures after breaking out Thursday near the Los Angeles County and Ventura County line. The Gifford Fire, California's largest blaze so far this year, has scorched at least 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on Aug.

Article: Bob died on Sunday morning – peacefully, according to a Facebook update shared by Lisa Johnson Mitchell, the director of His Name is Bob, the appropriately named 2010 documentary that attempted to decipher his widespread lore. So often throughout the ’10s, he’d inexplicably appear on a rock club stage, smiling and hoisting his keyboard in the air as a touring indie rock outfit warmly welcomed his presence and played on around him to the cheers of the knowing local crowd. Even more commonly, at the bleary-eyed end of the night, after banging out a few melodies to anyone who'd listen he could be found along the sidewalks of Elm Street, pleading with familiar faces to give him a ride to his place. After being introduced to the crowd by one of the area’s patrol cops, Hall spoke for a few minutes, promising the dozens in attendance that her department was taking their concerns seriously and laying out some vague plans she was working to address the issues. Actually, he had less of a question than a statement; Bob wanted the chief to know that he felt he was having too tough a time lately waving down bartenders to bring him a soda — preferably a Dr Pepper, if at all possible.

Article: The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow’s uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia’s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit. WATCH: Trump will meet with Putin in Alaska for talks on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has stood firm in his positions, agreeing to a ceasefire proposed by Trump while reaffirming the country’s refusal to abandon seeking NATO membership and rejecting acknowledgment of Russia’s annexation of any of its regions. Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.” A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve: Russia’s position In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a “package proposal” for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. READ MORE: Zelenskyy rejects Trump’s suggestion of ceding Ukrainian territory to end war with Russia Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian — conditions reflecting Putin’s earliest goals. Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven’t been any shifts in the Russian position. It reaffirmed Ukraine’s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance. Although Trump expressed disappointment with Putin, his agreement to meet him without Zelenskyy at the table raised worries in Ukraine and its European allies, who fear it could allow the Russian to get Trump on his side and strong-arm Ukraine into concessions. Trump said without giving details that “there’ll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine as part of any peace deal that he will discuss with Putin when they meet Friday. WATCH: Trump suggests ‘swapping’ Ukraine and Russia territories ahead of meeting with Putin Putin repeatedly warned Ukraine will face tougher conditions for peace if it doesn’t accept Moscow’s demands as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for the territories of the four annexed by Moscow still under Ukrainian control. “That is potentially a situation that gives Putin a tremendous amount of leeway as long as he can use that leverage to force the Ukrainians into a deal that they may not like and to sideline the Europeans effectively,” Sam Greene of King’s College London said. “The question is, will Trump sign up to that and will he actually have the leverage to force the Ukrainians and the Europeans to accept it?” Putin could accept a temporary truce to win Trump’s sympathy as he seeks to achieve broader goals, Greene said. “He understands that his only route to getting there runs via Trump.” In a possible indication he thinks a ceasefire or peace deal could be close, Putin called the leaders of China, India, South Africa and several ex-Soviet nations in an apparent effort to inform these allies about prospective agreements. “However these conditions are worded, they amount to the same demand: Ukraine stops resisting, the West halts arms supplies, and Kyiv accepts Russia’s terms, which effectively amount to a de facto capitulation,” she posted on X. It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.” She predicted Putin might agree to meet Zelenskyy but noted the Kremlin leader would only accept such a meeting “if there is a prearranged agenda and predetermined outcomes, which remains difficult to imagine.” “The likely scenario is that this peace effort will fail once again,” she said.

Heather Hamilton, who snorkels off the coast of Cornwall virtually every week with her father David, has swum through large blooms of salps, a species that looks a bit like a jellyfish. "It just felt very kind of out of this world, something I've never seen before."

Some exceptional sea temperatures have also been detected by measurement buoys off the UK coast, known as WaveNet and run by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). The Met Office says its data from the end of June 2024 to now is provisional and will be finalised in the coming months, but this usually results in only very minor changes. "All the way through the year, on average it's been warmer than we've really ever seen [for the UK's seas]," said Prof John Pinnegar, the lead adviser on climate change at Cefas.

"This is the kind of fire that is really driven in part by the significant drought-stressed fuels that are out there," says Bethany Urban, a fire information officer with Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team 3.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) FILE - Shipping containers are loaded onto trucks at CSX Intermodal Terminals, a supplier of rail-based freight transportation, at CSX Queensgate Rail Yard, May 7, 2025, in Cincinnati. President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% last week, but a key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. “Canada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity.” ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.

Article: Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package FILE - Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Thursday, Feb. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Tesla is awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a judge ordered the company to revoke his massive pay package. The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO. At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. “Musk remains Tesla’s big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.” Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting. Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajection of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration in its bid to slash the size of the U.S.

(Elizabeth Williams via AP) NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed. Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request. He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week. Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

Article: In this article Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group Corp., speaks at the SoftBank World event in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images Masayoshi Son is making his biggest bet yet: that his brainchild SoftBank will be the center of a revolution driven by artificial intelligence. Now, the billionaire is hoping to replicate that success with a series of investments and acquisitions in AI firms that will put SoftBank at the center of a fundamental technological shift. "I vividly remember the first time he invited me to his home for dinner and sitting on his porch over a glass of wine, he started talking to me about singularity – the point at which machine intelligence overtakes human intelligence," Alok Sama, a former finance chief at SoftBank until 2016 and and president until 2019, told CNBC. That may go some way to explain what has been an aggressive drive over the past few years — but especially the last two — to put SoftBank at the center of the AI story. While Arm blueprints form the basis of the designs for nearly all the world's smartphones, these days, the company is looking to position itself as a key player in AI infrastructure. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is another marquee investment for SoftBank, with the Japanese giant saying recently that planned investments in the company will reach about 4.8 trillion Japanese yen ($32.7 billion). "SoftBank's AI strategy is comprehensive, spanning the entire AI stack from foundational semiconductors, software, infrastructure, and robotics to cutting-edge cloud services and end applications across critical verticals such as enterprise, education, health, and autonomous systems," Neil Shah, co-founder at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. Son's vision is to cohesively connect and deeply integrate these components, thereby establishing a powerful AI ecosystem designed to maximize long-term value for our shareholders." Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon SoftBank's stock performance since 2017, the year that its first Vision Fund was founded. There is a common theme behind SoftBank's investments in AI companies that comes directly from Son — namely, that these firms should be using advanced intelligence to be more competitive, successful, to make their product better and their customers happy, a person familiar with the company told CNBC. Major tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Tesla boss Elon Musk are now talking about robotics as a key application of AI — but Son was thinking about this more than a decade ago. Two years later, the two companies launched a humanoid robot called Pepper, which they billed as "the world's first personal robot that can read emotions." Later, Son said: "In 30 years, I hope robots will become one of the core businesses in generating profits for the SoftBank group." SoftBank's bet on Pepper ultimately flopped for the company. But investments in Chinese technology companies and some bad bets on firms like WeWork soured sentiment for the Vision Fund as it racked up billions of dollars of losses by 2023. Vision but bad timing The market questioned some of Son's investments in companies like Uber and Didi, which were burning through cash at the time and had unclear unit economics. "When those companies came to head in 2021, 2022, Masa would have been in a perfect place but he had used all his ammunition on other companies," the former Vision Fund exec said. "When they came to age in 21, 22, the Vision Fund had invested in five or six hundred different companies and he was not in a position to invest in AI and he missed that." Son himself said this year that SoftBank wanted to invest in OpenAI as early as 2019, but it was Microsoft that ended up becoming the key investor.

Article: Al Jazeera Media Network condemns in the strongest terms the targeted assassination of its correspondents Anas Al Sharif and Mohammed Qraiqea, along with photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher, and Mohamed Nofal, by the Israeli occupation forces in yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom. In a statement by the Israeli occupation force, admitting to their crimes, the journalists were targeted by a directed assault towards the tent where they were stationed opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza. This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities. The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza. As Al Jazeera Media Network bids farewell to yet another group of its finest journalists, who boldly and courageously documented the plight of Gaza and its people since the onset of the war, it holds the Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists. Advertisement Despite losing several journalists to deliberate attacks and working under constant threat, Anas Al Sharif, Mohammed Qraiqea, and their colleagues persisted in the strip to ensure the world sees the harrowing truth experienced by Gaza’s populace. While vehemently condemning these heinous crimes and the ongoing attempts by Israeli authorities to silence the truth, Al Jazeera Media Network calls on the international community and all relevant organisations to take decisive measures to halt this ongoing genocide and end the deliberate targeting of journalists.

Article: The Israel Defense Forces said that it killed a man in Gaza who it claimed was posing as an Al Jazeera journalist, but the news network said that Anas al-Sharif was a journalist and that he and four other staff members were killed in a targeted Israeli airstrike. The network reported that they died “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israel Defense Forces claimed that al-Sharif was "the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops." The IDF said in a statement about the killing that it had "previously disclosed intelligence information and many documents found in the Gaza Strip" that it said confirm that al-Sharif was a member of Hamas. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in a statement. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.” After an IDF spokesperson accused al-Sharif of being affiliated with Hamas' military wing in July, al-Sharif told the CPJ that he was being retaliated against for news coverage that made Israel look bad.

Article: As President Donald Trump pushes the Senate to confirm his federal judicial nominees, a review by The Associated Press shows that roughly half of them have revealed anti-abortion views, been associated with anti-abortion groups or defended abortion restrictions. Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University, said judicial nominations “are a way of federally shaping the abortion question without going through Congress or making a big, explicit statement.” "It’s a way to cover up a little bit what is happening in the abortion sphere compared to legislation or executive orders that may be more visible, dramatic and spark more backlash,” she said. Trump is having an enduring impact on the federal courts Of the 17 judicial nominees so far in Trump's second term, at least eight have argued in favor of abortion restrictions or against expanded abortion access. “The Democrats’ extreme position on abortion was rejected in November in favor of President Trump’s commonsense approach, which allows states to decide, supports the sanctity of human life, and prevents taxpayer funding of abortion.” Trump's first term also had an enduring impact on the courts, appointing 234 judges. Challenging abortion care, medication, Planned Parenthood In his second term, all but five of his 17 nominees are from states that went for Trump in 2024 and where Republicans have pushed severe abortion restrictions. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because “this is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.” — Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution’s protections for religious freedom. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a “barbaric practice” and “one of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable” in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. — Joshua Divine, a deputy solicitor general of Missouri who is nominated to be a district judge in the state, is currently representing Missouri in a case challenging the FDA approval of mifepristone. Divine co-authored the lawsuit, which includes misinformation about medication abortion, including that it “starves the baby to death in the womb.” In his college newspaper, Divine described himself as a “zealot" for the anti-abortion movement, referred to abortion as “the killing of an innocent, genetically unique human being” and argued that life begins at fertilization. Those include ones that sought to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; require a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory ultrasounds for abortion patients; require parental notification for minors to get an abortion; prohibit the use of state funding for abortions; prohibit certain insurance policies from covering abortions; and restrict what types of medical professionals can dispense medication abortion. Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for Students for Life, said she was hopeful the administration will continue nominating those “who will respect the rule of law.” Abortion rights advocates said Trump is embedding abortion opponents into the judiciary one judge at a time. Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said the courts, until now, have largely been an effective option for advocates to challenge state abortion bans and restrictions. “This just feeds into this larger strategy where Trump has gotten away with distancing himself from abortion — saying he’s going to leave it to the states while simultaneously appointing anti-abortion extremists at all levels of government," she said.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the “central camps” and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Example video title will go here for this video Example video title will go here for this video To stream WFAA on your phone, you need the WFAA app. ATLANTA — A Georgia man who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal has been identified as the shooter who opened fire late Friday on the U.S. The 30-year-old suspect, who died during the incident, had also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation. A union representing workers at the CDC said the incident was not random and “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured." It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk. Here's what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation: Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was “complex” and the investigation would take “an extended period of time." The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.” Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release. is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through "his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust.” Kennedy reached out to staff on Saturday, saying “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the campus. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff. White's father, who contacted police and identified his son as the possible shooter, said White had been upset over the death of his dog and also had become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the law enforcement official. A neighbor of White told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.

King, Muddy Waters and all of them,” he tells The Associated Press over the phone, “I do the best I can to keep the blues alive.” He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons “Ain't Done with the Blues” is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten — like on the album closer “Talk to Your Daughter,” a rendition of the J.B. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of “Sinners.” Jaime Marconette, Luminate’s vice president of music insights and industry relations, describes the current moment as a “resurgence of the blues,” following “Sinners.” “Several artists featured on the film’s soundtrack, which includes works from real-life blues, folk and country musicians, saw spikes the week of the film’s theatrical release,” he explains. “They ain’t never gonna come in and say, ‘I heard it on the radio.’” That's part of the reason why Guy decided to participate in the movie in the first place. “I hope this will give the blues a boost, because my worry right now is, like I said, a young person don’t know how good a gumbo is — you’ve got to taste it.” For now, he's excited to see how people respond to his new album, “Ain't Done with the Blues” — but he's not listening to it.

Defendants include special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office and the county board of commissioners. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor recently spoke to The Associated Press at San Diego’s Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.

Article: Australia said Monday that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing list of Western governments making the move as Israel becomes increasingly isolated over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” he said at a news conference after a cabinet meeting in Canberra. Though largely symbolic, they indicate a broader global shift against Israel’s policies in Gaza, where the United Nations and others say people are dying of malnutrition and starvation after months of limited or nonexistent aid. Albanese said Australia’s position was predicated on the commitments it had received from the Palestinian Authority, including that there would be no role for Hamas in any future Palestinian state.

Article: Lucy Letby: How the case of one baby death shows flaws in the medical evidence on both sides 18 minutes ago Share Save Jonathan Coffey BBC Panorama Share Save BBC When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Panorama Barrister Mark McDonald says his panel of leading experts found no evidence that any babies were deliberately harmed Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was "unlikely" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. "But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation." Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in pre-term babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Reuters In many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. Andy Rain/ EPA - EFE/REX/Shutterstock Professor Neena Modi believes there is some postmortem evidence of air embolism but this is likely to have occurred during resuscitation (pictured far left, with Professor Shoo Lee far right) To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder." The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: "Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time." Julia Quenzler / BBC The needle theory was examined at length during Lucy Letby's trial It was a bombshell claim. One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver." Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his "opinion has not substantially changed". Lack of consensus among the experts The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Panorama Dr Mike Hall, Letby's original defence expert, says there is no record of a traumatic delivery in Baby O's medical notes However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know." The insulin evidence For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning.

Article: So these Ukrainian children spend summer together 42 minutes ago Share Save Will Vernon BBC News in Ukraine Share Save BBC Children comfort each other as they share their experiences of the war The day Russia's full-scale invasion began, Dima's dad told him he might never see him again. Dad said, 'I'm going to do everything I can so that you can live a normal life.'" Days later, Dima's father had joined the military and left for the front line. "Many of these children have multiple traumas because not only are their fathers missing, but some of them have uncles and grandmothers missing too," explains Vanui Martirosyan, lead psychologist at the charity. And we cannot work with them like with children with actual loss, because they do not have this point of starting grieving." She says many of the children spend hours trawling Russian social media channels, desperately searching for information about their family members. This type of trauma is maybe the most difficult to work with." The day after the campfire meeting, I speak to Dima, who wants to tell me more about his dad. I realised I wouldn't see my dad for a while." For many of the children the camp is an opportunity to escape the constant threat of missile strikes During all our interviews with the children, including with Dima, a Gen.Ukrainian psychologist was present. Then another soldier who was at Dad's position said they saw him dead, with shrapnel wounds to the head." Dima says the effect on both him and his mother was profound. "When Dad left, he said, 'Dima, no matter what happens you must look after Mum because you're a man, and you're her son."' Group therapy at the camp takes place daily, held in small rooms. One seven-year-old boy, Zahar, tells me his painting is called "Daddy comes home." It shows yellow stick men in front of a blue sky - the colours of the Ukrainian flag. "I love him very much and I know he loves me too," she continues, adding, "I hope we can make new memories with him again." This camp also offers the kids a chance to catch up on sleep, uninterrupted by air-raid sirens - and to just have fun and play.

Article: South Korea military shrinks by 20% due to low birthrate South Korea's military has fallen below the 500,000 threshold that experts say is needed to maintain defence readiness A study published by South Korean researchers in July had suggested that the country would need at least 500,000 soldiers to defend against an attack from the North, which is believed to have 1.3 million active-duty members. According to the defense ministry report on Sunday, the number of divisions in South Korea's military has dropped from 59 to 42 since 2006 - with the units either disbanded or merged with one another. The country has repeatedly broken its own record for having the world's lowest birth rate: 0.98 babies per woman in 2018, 0.84 in 2020, 0.72 in 2023 and 0.75 in 2024.

In May, new regulations went into effect that eased migrants’ ability to obtain residency and work permits, and the Spanish Parliament began debating a bill to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants. Last year the national birthrate was 1.4, the second lowest in the European Union and well below the 2.1 threshold needed to maintain the country’s population level of around 48 million people. The push for the undocumented immigrants’ amnesty did not originate with the government, tellingly, but with a popular petition that garnered 600,000 signatures and was endorsed by 900 nongovernmental organizations, business groups and even the Spanish Conference of Bishops.

His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a "humanitarian catastrophe." Australia's government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. "A two-state solution is humanity's best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza," Albanese said. "The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children." Ahead of Albanese's announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state.

Boluarte arrived in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta on Sunday afternoon, following an invitation President Prabowo extended when the two leaders met at the APEC Summit in Peru in November 2024. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. The two leaders are expected to witness the signing of CEPA that could be a major booster to bilateral trade, said Indonesia’s trade minister Budi Santoso ahead of the visit. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” Santoso said, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry’s data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File) FILE - Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., delivers his State of the Nation Address at the House of Representatives in Quezon City, Philippines, on July 28, 2025. said Monday his country would inevitably be drawn “kicking and screaming” into any war over Taiwan due to its proximity to the self-ruled island and the presence of large numbers of Filipino workers there, despite China’s strong protest over such remarks. Marcos also told a news conference that the Philippines' coast guard, navy and other vessels defending its territorial interests in the South China Sea would never back down and would stand their ground in the contested waters after the Chinese coast guard on Monday staged dangerous blocking maneuvers and used a powerful water cannon to try to drive away Philippine vessels from the hotly disputed Scarborough Shoal. It’s the latest flare-up of long-simmering territorial disputes in the busy waterway, a key global trade route, where overlapping claims between China and the Philippines have escalated in recent years. Relations between China and the Philippines have been severely strained after Marcos, who took office in mid-2022, and his administration emerged as some of the most vocal critics in Asia of China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. The Marcos administration deepened its treaty alliance engagements with the United States and started broadening security alliances with other Western and Asian countries like Japan, Australia, India and some EU member states to strengthen deterrence against Beijing’s assertiveness. China protested last week and accused Marcos of interfering in its domestic affairs and violating its “One China” policy when he told reporters on the sidelines of a visit to India that there was no way the Philippines could stay out of a possible war in Taiwan because of his country’s proximity to it and the presence of about 200,000 Filipino workers on the self-ruled island. The Chinese Foreign Ministry then said through a spokesperson that “'geographic location' and a ‘large volume of Filipinos’ in Taiwan should not be used as pretexts to interfere in the internal and sovereign affairs of other countries” and urged the Philippines “to earnestly abide by the One China principle” and “refrain from playing fire on issues bearing on China’s core interests.” Asked to comment on China’s protest, Marcos said he was perplexed and could not understand Beijing’s concern. We do not want to go to war, but I think if there is a war over Taiwan, we will be drawn, we will be pulled in whether we like it or not, kicking and screaming,” Marcos said. I hope it doesn’t happen, but, if it does, we have to plan for it already.” Separately, Philippine Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela said Chinese coast guard ships chased and staged dangerous blocking maneuvers on Monday against Philippine coast guard and fishing vessels in the Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing atoll in the South China Sea off the northwestern Philippines.

Following the latest bilateral meeting in Stockholm in July, Beijing had struck an optimistic tone, saying that both sides would work toward extending the tariff truce by another 90 days. In May, the two sides agreed to a 90-day tariff truce that reduced duties the prohibitive 145% in April while also pausing a series of punitive measures, allowing room for further negotiation to reach a lasting deal. but by no means a friendlier one," said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, noting that both sides are "structurally heading more toward decoupling as a consequence of the new global trade and geopolitical environment." Purchase agreement, transshipment Despite the tariff truce, trade between the Washington and Beijing has been hit substantially. In a post on Truth Social Sunday night stateside, Trump said he hoped China to "quickly quadruple its soybean orders." China has ramped up soybean purchases in recent months, with imports volumes growing 36.2%, 10.4% and 18.4% in May, June and July, respectively, according to Wind Information. Trade experts have warned that exports — a critical growth driver for China's economy — could slow down in the coming months as Trump levies a blanket 40% tariff on goods routed through third-party countries, although providing little clarity over how those shipments would be defined. and China on semiconductor export controls have also escalated in recent weeks, even as Nvidia plans to resume sales of its H20 chip to China, reversing export controls on H20 sales imposed by Trump in April.

Article: Legendary Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter dies at 92 19 minutes ago Share Save Share Save BBC Long-serving Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter, who turned the children's show into a television institution, has died at the age of 92. "My friends and I held bring-and-buy sales for the Spitfire fund and put on plays and concerts for the British Red Cross and Aid to France." She was keen to introduce pets to the programme She was educated at a local grammar school before going to St Mary's College, Durham University in 1952. I do hope it's better.' It's only a tiny thing, but children aren't stupid." Baxter later estimated that 75% of the show's content was based on ideas submitted by its audience. "Her life was that show." he recalled "Without that obsessional talent, the programme would never have maintained the quality that it did.” Stiletto heels The iconic Blue Peter annuals began to appear with their mixture of entertaining but also informative articles. But while the presenters were the public face of Blue Peter there was never any doubt about who ran the show and most of her team were in awe of her. Baxter in a rare public appearance on the Blue Peter set One studio manager recalled that her habit of striding across the studio in stiletto heels damaged the floor but no-one had the courage to tell her. Peter Purves, who joined Blue Peter as a presenter in 1967 recalled: "This woman controlled our lives, and she didn't do it very nicely." Valerie Singleton complained she treated presenters like children. "How can you have a Blue Peter presenter on commercial television advertising dog food so children think, 'I must buy this.'" Children were encouraged to contribute ideas for the programme In the event, Noakes did the adverts with a lookalike dog. At the time, it was reported that she decided to leave when her husband, the musicologist John Hosier, was offered a job in China and she decided to go with him. But Richard Marson - her colleague-turned-biographer - insisted that she was was "manoeuvred out in the summer of 1988 by a new head of children’s programmes who wanted the show to evolve without its all-powerful matriarch." She was devastated, but did not complain in public.

The 52-strong German High Seas fleet was scuttled - deliberately sunk - by its crews in 1919 when the commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, mistakenly thought peace talks had failed. Orkney Islands Council, which has been pushing for historic MPA status for many years, assessed that the wrecks were vulnerable and there was a risk of losing "features of historical importance."

Article: Late in the summer of 2021, Greer Jarrett set out on the first of 26 voyages to retrace the maritime paths taken by Norse sailors during the Viking Age, which lasted from roughly A.D. The Vikings, beyond their reputation as medieval bad boys — Pillage People, if you will — were accomplished traders who established commercial routes that stretched all the way to Baghdad. Jarrett, a doctoral candidate in archaeology at Lund University in Sweden, was intrigued not only by where these ancient mariners started and wound up, but also the paths they took to get there. Most of the journeys were undertaken in 30-foot fyringer, square-rigged, open clinker boats, built in the tradition of Afjord, a small Norwegian municipality where Viking-era boatbuilding techniques endured into the 20th century.

(AP Photo/Eric Thayer, File) SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act “fail as a matter of law.” They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

Article: Security footage from a hospital in Sweida in southern Syria shows what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb This is a locator map for Syria with its capital, Damascus. (AP Photo) DAMASCUS, Syria -- Footage from security cameras at a hospital in the city of Sweida in southern Syria published Sunday showed what appears to be the killing of a medical worker by men in military garb. The video published by activist media collective Suwayda 24 was dated July 16, during intense clashes between militias of the Druze minority community and armed tribal groups and government forces. A Syrian government official said they could not immediately identify the attackers in the video, and are investigating the incident to try to figure out if they are government-affiliated personnel or gunmen from tribal groups. Abdul Qader Al-Tahhan was assigned to oversee the investigation "to ensure that the perpetrators are identified and arrested as quickly as possible.” “We condemn and denounce this act in the strongest terms, and we affirm that the perpetrators will be held accountable and brought to justice to receive their just punishment, regardless of their affiliations," the statement said. The incident at the Sweida National Hospital further exacerbates tensions between the Druze minority community and the Syrian government, after clashes in July between Druze and armed Bedouin groups sparked targeted sectarian attacks against them. Though the fighting has largely calmed down, government forces have surrounded the southern city and the Druze have said that little aid is going into the battered city, calling it a siege. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which has organized aid convoys into Sweida, said in a statement on Saturday that one of those convoys that was carrying aid in the day before “came under direct fire,” and some of its vehicles were damaged. It called for the government to “ensure credible, swift, transparent, impartial, and comprehensive investigations.” The statement also reiterated “obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transportation and equipment, as well as hospitals and medical facilities.” It expressed concern about "foreign terrorist fighters" in Syria, while calling on “all states to refrain from any action or interference that may further destabilize the country,” an apparent message to Israel, which intervened in last month's conflict on the side of the Druze, launching airstrikes on Syrian government forces.

Article: Joy Falatiya says she fell apart after her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in South Sudan in March 2024 People participate in a Self Help Plus session at St. (AP Photo/Florence Miettaux) MUNDRI, South Sudan -- Joy Falatiya said her husband kicked her and five children out of their home in March 2024 and that she fell apart after that. She told The Associated Press that her suicidal thoughts are now gone after months of psycho-social therapy, even though she still struggles to feed her children and can’t afford to keep them in school. ___ The clinic is in one of eight locations chosen for a project that aimed to provide mental health services for the first time to over 20,000 people across this East African country. Across South Sudan, there has been massive displacement of people in the civil war that began in 2013 when government troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fought those loyal to Vice President Riek Machar. to warn of a possible “relapse into large scale conflict.” The violence persists even today, with Machar under house arrest and government forces continuing with a campaign to weaken his ability to wage war. And poverty — over 90% of the country's people live on less than $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank — is rampant in many areas, adding to the mental health pressures many people face, according to experts. In South Sudan, suicide affects mostly the internally displaced, fueled by confinement and pressures related to poverty, idleness, armed conflict, and gender-based violence, according to the International Organization for Migration. "So the burden for the individuals, their families and their communities is huge in this country, and it has gone quite unaddressed so far.” Last month, authorities in Juba raised an alarm after 12 cases of suicide were reported in just a week in the South Sudan capital. Atong Ayuel Longar, one of South Sudan’s very few psychiatrists and the leader of the mental health department at the health ministry, said a pervasive sense of “uncertainty is what affects the population the most" amid the constant threat of war. Things are getting tough." In Mundri, the AP visited several mental health facilities in June and spoke to many patients, including women who have recently lost relatives in South Sudan's conflict. As one of the charities seeking to expand mental health services, the Catholic non-governmental organization Caritas organizes sessions of Self Help Plus, a group-based stress management course launched by WHO in 2021. Longar, the psychiatrist, said she believes the community must be equipped with tools “to heal and to help themselves by themselves, and break the cycle of trauma." But she worries about whether such support can be kept sustainable as funds continue to dwindle, reflecting the retreat by the United States from its once-generous foreign aid program. The project that may have helped save Falatiya's life, funded until November by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation and the Athens-based Stavros Niarchos Foundation, will come to an end without additional donor funding. “What happened to me in the past was very dangerous, but the thought of bad things can be removed,” Falatiya said, surveying a garden she cultivates outside her small home where a local man has allowed her to stay after taking pity on her.

The Metropolitan Police Service released the updated figures as protesters demanding the immediate release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza held their own march through central London on Sunday afternoon. Backers of Palestine Action staged the protest to underscore their belief that the government is illegally restricting freedom of expression by banning a direct action organization that has challenged its policies. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who oversees law enforcement in Britain, rejected that characterization, saying Palestine Action was banned after committing serious attacks involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage. “The right to protest is one we protect fiercely but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organization,” Cooper said in a statement. Police said the process of deciding whether to file charges against those arrested is likely to take weeks as officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command put together case files and seek approval from prosecutors, and in some cases the attorney general.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez, file) Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said at a news conference in Canberra. Speaking a day after the protest, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that “there is a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognise.” “In relation to recognition, I’ve said for over a year now, it’s a matter of when, not if,” Wong added. The opposition Liberal Party criticised the move, saying it put Australia at odds with the United States, its closest ally, and reversed a bipartisan consensus that there should be no recognition while Hamas remains in control of Gaza. “Despite his words today, the reality is Anthony Albanese has committed Australia to recognising Palestine while hostages remain in tunnels under Gaza and with Hamas still in control of the population of Gaza. Advertisement “Recognising a Palestinian state prior to a return of the hostages and defeat of Hamas, as the Government has today, risks delivering Hamas one of its strategic objectives of the horrific terrorism of October 7.” The Australian Greens, the fourth-largest party in parliament, welcomed the move to recognise Palestine, but said the announcement did not meet the “overwhelming calls from the Australian public for the government to take material action”. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) also criticised the announcement, describing it as a “political fig leaf, letting Israel’s genocide and apartheid continue unchallenged, and distracting from Australia’s complicity in Israeli war crimes via ongoing weapons and components trade”. These “detailed and significant commitments” include the PA reaffirming it “recognises Israel’s right to exist in peace and security” and committing to “demilitarise and to hold general elections”, Albanese said while announcing the decision. Albanese said the commitments secured by Australia were “an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all”. New Zealand to decide on recognition next month Meanwhile, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Monday that his country’s cabinet will make a formal decision on Palestinian statehood in September. “Ultimately, New Zealand has an independent foreign policy, and on this issue, we intend to weigh up the issue carefully and then act according to New Zealand’s principles, values and national interest.” Peters said that while New Zealand has for some time considered the recognition of a Palestinian state a “matter of when, not if”, the issue is not “straightforward” or “clear-cut”. Over the next month, we look forward to canvassing this broad range of views before taking a proposal to Cabinet.” Of the UN’s 193 member states, 147 already recognise Palestinian statehood, representing some three-quarters of the world’s countries and the vast majority of its population. The announcements by Australia and New Zealand on Monday came hours after an Israeli attack killed five Al Jazeera staff members in Gaza City, and as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to threaten a full-scale invasion of the city in the north of the Gaza Strip.

Article: Trump demands homeless people 'immediately' move out of Washington DC Trump signed an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people, and he last week ordered federal law enforcement into the streets of Washington DC. US President Donald Trump has said homeless people must "move out" of Washington DC as he vowed to tackle crime in the city, but the mayor pushed back against the White House likening the capital to Baghdad. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" The specifics of the president's plan are not yet clear, but in a 2022 speech he proposed moving homeless people to "high quality" tents on inexpensive land outside cities, while providing access to bathrooms and medical professionals. On Friday, Trump ordered federal agents - including from US Park Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the US Marshals Service - into Washington DC to curb what he called "totally out of control" levels of crime. "We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low." She criticised White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for dubbing the US capital "more violent than Baghdad". But federal data from January suggests that Washington DC last year recorded its lowest overall violent crime figures - once carjacking, assault and robberies are incorporated - in 30 years. In another post on Sunday he said the event at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT) would address ending "crime, murder and death" in the city, as well as its "physical renovation". Community Partnership, an organisation that works to reduce homelessness in Washington DC, told Reuters news agency that the city of 700,000 residents had about 3,782 people homeless on any given night.

He is transferring 100% ownership of the family-owned business to an employee trust which means staff will get a share of the profits and a say in how the firm is run. "If the business had been sold just for money that would not have been passing on the baton in the way in which the family would have wanted," Mr Grant told the BBC. "That's when I think the staff will start to see something a little bit more meaningful." Under an employee ownership trust, Mr Grant and his family will be financially rewarded, too. The Entertainer Gary Grant started the toy chain with one shop in 1981 "The Entertainer has thrived against all the odds," says Mr Grant, listing the financial crisis of 2008, the Covid pandemic, the decline of the High Street and the shift to online. The Entertainer Gary Grant pictured in 1981 in his first toy shop Two of their four children work in the company but Mr Grant says they have got "other plans for their lives" and after lengthy succession planning, which explored a number of exit options, the family chose an employee ownership trust.

He told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster (GMU) programme that the man asked Fr Murray if he would hear his confession just before the morning service was due to start and "it was at that stage that he was attacked". 'Difficult to comprehend' Fr Murray was due to celebrate Mass at St Patrick's Church Fr McGee said Bishop of Down and Connor, Alan McGuckian, went to the hospital on Sunday night to meet with the family of Fr Murray and some of the clergy went to see the family of the man who has been killed. Fr McGee described Fr Murray as "very well known" and "very well respected priest" of the diocese who had been appointed a canon by the bishop in recognition for his work as a senior adviser. Fr Martin Graham, who took the service, said it was about being with the parishioners and praying with them, for Fr Murray and also "for the other poor man who lost his life". "It is just heartbreaking for them in what was supposed to be a poignant farewell this morning that it turned into something which was just grotesque." Sinn Fein councillor Oonagh Hanlon, who attended the vigil, described it as a "very sombre and very respectful" event which also remembered the man who was killed.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Ukrainian servicemen of the 148th artillery brigade load ammunition into a M777 howitzer before firing towards Russian positions at the frontline in Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, on Thursday, Aug. (AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) DONETSK REGION, Ukraine -- In a dugout where each nearby blast sends dirt raining from the ceiling and the black plastic lining the walls slipping down, Ukrainian soldiers say peace talks feel distant and unlikely to end the war. President Donald Trump that there will be some " swapping of territories” — as well as media reports that it would involve Ukrainian troops leaving the Donetsk region where they have fought for years defending every inch of land — have stirred confusion and rejection among the soldiers. “At minimum, the result would be to stop active fighting — that would be the first sign of some kind of settlement,” said soldier Dmytro Loviniukov of the 148th Brigade. When direct talks between Russia and Ukraine were held in Istanbul in May, the soldiers from 148th brigade read the news with cautious hope, said a soldier with the call sign Bronson, who once worked as a tattoo artist. President Donald Trump reportedly gave Russia's Vladimir Putin — one that has since vanished from the agenda amid talk of a meeting in Alaska — the Russian fire roared every minute for hours. No one else will come here to defend us.” Dozens of kilometers from Zaporizhzhia region, north to the Donetsk area, heavy fighting grinds on toward Pokrovsk — now the epicenter of fighting. If we’re here, we need to cover our brothers in arms.” For Serhii Filimonov, commander of the “Da Vinci Wolves” battalion of the 59th brigade, the war’s end is nowhere in sight, and current news doesn’t influence the ongoing struggle to find enough resources to equip the unit that is fighting around Pokrovsk. The big question is what security guarantees we get — and how we hit pause." A soldier with the call sign Mirche from the 68th brigade said that whenever there is a new round of talks, the hostilities intensify around Pokrovsk — Russia’s key priority during this summer’s campaign.

Article: SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A short drive from the Mediterranean coast, mid-altitude mountain resorts near Sarajevo — traditionally dependent on snow sports — are slowly but steadily pivoting to attract summertime tourists. “We used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,” said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president. Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. “The weather here is fantastic — it's not hot at all," said Dusko Kurtovic, a visitor from the Bosnian town of Doboj, while on a walk during a short vacation in Jahorina last week. The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years. Vasilije Knezevic, who leads quad tours of Jahorina’s highest peaks, noted that while the ski season was “bleak” because of the snow shortage, they are “having a fabulous summer so far.” Business might be growing in the mountains of Sarajevo, but it remains far less profitable than seaside destinations in neighboring Croatia, where tourism accounts for up to 20% of the country’s gross domestic product. Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik’s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders. While climate change is driving Bosnia and Croatia toward different tourism strategies, both countries share a common objective: to “extend the season” and become “year-round tourist destination,” in the words of Aida Hodzic of the Dubrovnik tourism board.

Article: Kyiv, Ukraine – Taras, a seasoned Ukrainian serviceman recovering from a contusion, expects “no miracles” from United States President Donald Trump’s August 15 summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. “There’s going to be no miracles, no peace deal in a week, and Putin will try to make Trump believe that it is Ukraine that doesn’t want peace,” the fair-haired 32-year-old with a deep brown tan acquired in the trenches of eastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. Taras, who spent more than three years on the front line and said he had recently shot down an explosives-laden Russian drone barging at him in a field covered with explosion craters, withheld his last name in accordance with the wartime protocol. Putin wants to dupe Trump by pandering to the US president’s self-image as a peacemaker to avoid further economic sanctions, while the Russian leader seeks a major military breakthrough in eastern Ukraine, Taras said. “Putin really believes that until this winter, he will seize something sizeable, or that [his troops] will break through the front line and will dictate terms to Ukraine,” Taras said. As the Trump administration trumpets the upcoming Alaska summit as a major step towards securing a ceasefire, Ukrainians — civilians and military personnel — and experts are largely pessimistic about the outcomes of the meeting between the US and Russian presidents. Earlier this month, Russia intensified its push to seize key locations in the southeastern Donetsk region, ordering thousands of servicemen to conduct nearly-suicidal missions to infiltrate Ukrainian positions, guarded 24/7 by buzzing drones with night and thermal vision. Advertisement In the past three months, Russian forces have occupied some 1,500sq km (580 square miles), mostly in Donetsk, of which Russia controls about three-fourths, according to Ukrainian and Western estimates based on geolocated photos and videos. But Kyiv’s daring counteroffensive and Moscow’s inability to hold onto areas around the capital and in Ukraine’s north resulted in the loss of 9 percent of occupied lands by the fall of 2022. Russia has since re-occupied less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory, despite losing hundreds of thousands of servicemen, while pummelling Ukrainian cities almost daily with swarms of drones and missiles. Ukraine also controls a tiny border area in Russia’s western Kursk region, where it started a successful offensive in August 2024, but lost most of its gains earlier this year. In exchange, Moscow could offer a ceasefire and the freezing of the front line in other Ukrainian regions, as well as the retreat from tiny toeholds in Sumy and the northeastern Kharkiv region, according to the reports. But to give up Donetsk, Kyiv would have to vacate a “fortress belt” that stretches some 50km (31 miles) along a strategic highway between the towns of Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk. Donetsk’s surrender would “position Russian forces extremely well to renew their attacks on much more favorable terms, having avoided a long and bloody struggle for the ground,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said on Friday. Some civilian Ukrainians hold a gloomy view on the prospects of peace, believing that Kyiv’s tilt towards democracy and presumed eventual membership in the European Union, and Moscow’s “imperialistic nature” set up an equation that prevents a sustainable diplomatic solution. Advertisement “The war will go on until [either] Ukraine or Russia exist,” Iryna Kvasnevska, a biology teacher in Kyiv whose first cousin was killed in eastern Ukraine in 2023, told Al Jazeera. Despite Trump’s recent change in rhetoric and growing public dissatisfaction with Moscow’s reluctance to end the hostilities, the US president has a history of blaming Ukraine – for the war and its demands of its allies – while some of his negotiators have repeated Moscow’s talking points. It is also unclear whether Zelenskyy will be invited to a trilateral meet with Trump and Putin in Alaska, or whether the US will go ahead and seek to shape the future of Ukraine without Kyiv in the room. “Trump has let us down several times, and the people who believe he won’t do it again are very naive, if not stupid,” Leonid Cherkasin, a retired colonel from the Black Sea port of Odesa who fought pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk in 2014-2015 and suffered contusions, shrapnel and bullet wounds, told Al Jazeera. He referred to Trump’s pledges during his re-election campaign to “end the war in 24 hours”, and his ultimatums to impose crippling sanctions on Russia if Putin does not show progress in a peace settlement. Meanwhile, the very fact of a face-to-face with Trump heralds a diplomatic victory for Putin, who has become a political pariah in the West and faces child abduction charges that have led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant against him. “I think the deal will be limited to an agreement on cessation of air strikes, and Putin will get three months to finalise the land operations – that is, to seize the [entire] Donetsk region.” An air ceasefire may benefit Russia, as it can amass thousands of drones and hundreds of missiles for future attacks.

Article: Israel has assassinated Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif and four other staff in a targeted attack on a tent in Gaza City, taking the total number of journalists killed since October 7, 2023 to 269. Correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal were meeting in a media tent outside al-Shifa Hospital when they were targeted by a drone. “This attack comes amid the catastrophic consequences of the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, which has seen the relentless slaughter of civilians, forced starvation, and the obliteration of entire communities,” the network said in a statement. “The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza’s bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.” The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says it is “appalled” by Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalists. Since Israel launched its war on the enclave in October 2023, it has routinely accused Palestinian journalists in Gaza of being Hamas members, as part of what rights groups say is an effort to discredit their reporting of Israeli abuses.

British Antarctic Survey Dennis Bell in 1959 at the Admiralty Bay station - he was known for his love of the husky dogs "Dennis was one of the many brave personnel who contributed to the early science and exploration of Antarctica under extraordinarily harsh conditions," says Professor Dame Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey . Dariusz Puczko The bones were found on the moraine and surface of the Ecology Glacier, on western shore of Admiralty Bay It was David who answered the door in his family home in Harrow, London, in July 1959. David Bell, 86, spoke to BBC News from his home in Australia "One of the funniest things was, and I still can't get over this, one evening when me, my mother and father came home from the cinema," David continues. "And I have to say this in fairness to Dennis, he had put a newspaper down on the kitchen table, but on top of it, he'd taken a motorbike engine apart and it was all over the table," he says. Bell Dennis Bell is on the far right of the picture, celebrating Christmas in Antarctica in 1958 - seven months before he died Dennis Bell, nicked-named "Tink", was born in 1934. He was stationed for a two-year assignment at Admiralty Bay, a small UK base with about 12 men on King George Island, which is roughly 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the northern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Russell Thompson Men at the base on King George Island relied on sledges and dogs to get around the harsh terrain The British Antarctica Survey keeps meticulous records and its archivist Ieuan Hopkins has dug out detailed base camp reports about Dennis's work and antics on the harsh and "ridiculously isolated" island. Reading aloud, Mr Hopkins says: "He's cheerful and industrious, with a mischievous sense of humour and fondness for practical jokes." Russell Thompson Dennis Bell (on the left) was known for his sense of humour - he is re-enacting an advert on the snow in this picture Dennis's job was to send up meteorological weather balloons and radio the reports to the UK every three hours, which involved firing up a generator in sub-zero conditions.

Due to Israel's military occupation, in the West Bank, the Palestinian authority, set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s, is not in full control of its land or people. Bettmann via Getty Images British troops lower the Union Flag to officially end British rule in Palestine in 1948 He went on to cite the 1917 Balfour Declaration - signed by his predecessor as foreign secretary Arthur Balfour - which first expressed Britain's support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people". The phrase refers to the creation of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But international efforts to bring about a two-state solution have come to nothing and Israel's colonisation of large parts of the West Bank, illegal under international law, has turned the concept into a largely empty slogan. Australia has become the latest country to say it will recognise Palestinian Statehood at the next UN General Assembly in September - after similar announcements from France, Japan, Canada and the UK, on some conditions. If the UK and France do recognise a Palestinian state next month, Palestine would have the support of four of the UN Security Council's five permanent members - the other two being China and Russia. Successive British governments have talked about recognising a Palestinian state, but only as part of a peace process, ideally in conjunction with other Western allies and "at the moment of maximum impact". Health Secretary Wes Streeting summed up the views of many MPs when he urged the government to recognise Palestine "while there is still a state of Palestine left to recognise".

Article: Boston Public Library aims to increase access to a vast historic archive using AI toggle caption Aram Boghosian for Boston Public Library Boston Public Library, one of the oldest and largest public library systems in the country, is launching a project this summer with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to make its trove of historically significant government documents more accessible to the public. "It really is an incredible repository of primary source materials covering the whole history of the United States as it has been expressed through government publications," said Jessica Chapel, the Boston Public Library's chief of digital and online services. Researchers at the Harvard Law School Library's Institutional Data Initiative are working with libraries, museums and archives on a number of fronts, including training new AI models to help libraries enhance the searchability of their collections. (Microsoft and OpenAI are among the many AI players targeted by recent copyright infringement lawsuits, in which plaintiffs such as authors claim the companies stole their works without permission.)

Article: So far in fiscal year 2025, tariffs have accounted for 2.7% of federal revenues — a jump over past years that will almost certainly climb higher if tariffs remain in place. "Historically, tariff revenue has never accounted for more than about 2% of total federal government revenues in the modern era," said Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. "And with the tariffs that are in place today, that could go up to 5% or perhaps even higher." Should tariff revenue eventually climb to that 5% level — that's significant, but it's not big enough to fulfill some of Trump's more outlandish promises. "And the purpose of what I'm doing is primarily to pay down debt, which will happen in very large quantity." Sponsor Message Tariff revenue is a tiny fraction of the national debt Tariff revenue right now is a tiny fraction of that debt, which stands near $37 trillion. While the new tariff revenue is considerable, there's a good chance it won't cover new debt that this administration just added in the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law last month. toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP There are more tariffs to come — but limits on how much tariff revenue can grow It is true, of course, that Trump is continually adding new tariffs. So while there's more tariff revenue now, she told NPR, "that must be offset against the lower revenue we're bringing in in income, payroll and corporate taxes as a result of the economy growing at only half the rate it was forecast before the year started."

Article: Jena Ardell/Moment RF/Getty Images According to posts on TikTok, hormonal birth control can cause a nearly unlimited list of ailments: Depression, irreversible infertility, acne, destruction of the gut biome, weight gain, balding, and decreased libido to name a few. Sponsor Message Keep in mind, social media can skew accuracy of risk-benefit calculations when it comes to making decisions about birth control, says Emily Pfender, a researcher at University of Pennsylvania who has studied the way contraception is represented on social media. (Hormonal birth control methods have a failure rate of less than 1%, when used correctly.) " The old joke we used to say is that those that use natural family planning have naturally large families," says Dr. "But many of my patients have busy lives and this may not be the thing they want to focus on." Conti says one person's experience with these apps should not be predictive for others. "But telling you that this is the only way to do it is a very privileged approach because you're only considering your exact situation and scenario." The nuance Complaints about birth control get conflated with another, real issue – that women often feel overlooked in medical settings, says Pfender. "I did not know the risks," says Morris in the video, as she points to a picture of an X-ray where, she says, her IUD became embedded in her uterus. But Jensen says that in the short time clinicians often have with their patients, focusing on uncommon side effects may mean less time to focus on those that are more likely. With an IUD, for example, Jensen says, complications that require surgery are rare – one study suggested that for every 1,000 IUDs, between one and two result in "intrauterine migration," which can require surgery to remove, and this is often a minimally invasive procedure. Common side effects like irregular bleeding are more worthy of discussion, he says: "That's something that actually clinicians should do a much better job at focusing on." The bigger picture Clinicians stress the importance of weighing potential side effects of hormonal birth control against the risks of unplanned pregnancy. "Social media often gives no context around what exposure to pregnancy means to women." Maternal mortality rates have improved in the last century, but there are still significant health risks, says Jensen, as well as considerations of equality.

"Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people," the Qatari network said in a statement. International media have been mostly barred from entering Gaza throughout the war and Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside Gaza, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza and Brown University's Watson Institute in April said the war was "quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters." Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were "part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability."

Once the roads to the North Fork treatment plant had been rebuilt and an enormous bypass line replaced, there was the problem of turbidity, a measure of the particulates clouding a fluid. But as one problem was being solved, another emerged: The city announced that lead had been detected in the water at some elementary schools (which were, thankfully, still using bottled water). The public was terrified, especially after a chemist and a chemical engineer reached out separately to The Asheville Watchdog to warn that lead exposure could be more widespread than believed. But no matter how eagerly I combed Asheville and its environs for unglued ideas about the water, I found nothing beyond moderate skepticism at “superchlorination” and what seemed like more households storing emergency water supplies. I could not initially appreciate why so many of the residents policed these boundaries — why, for instance, it was important to many of those I interviewed that I lived in the area.

Article: President Donald Trump will hold a news conference Monday that he said "will, essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." The president promoted the news conference in multiple posts on his social media platform and on Sunday posted that it would "also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." In a separate post, Trump said the homeless should leave D.C., accompanied by photos of homeless encampments along his route from the White House to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." The news conference comes after Trump last week ordered an increase in law enforcement as part of an executive order he signed in March to "Make the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful." A White House official said the law enforcement effort a "whole of government approach to improve overall public safety" and said that law enforcement will "be focused on high traffic tourist areas and other known hotspots." The official added that federal officers "will be identified, in marked units, and highly visible." Trump said Sunday that he has given D.C. "The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. Bowser said Sunday that Washington has spent the last two years driving down violent crime, “driving it down to a 30 year low, in fact.” “It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023, this is 2025 and we've done that by working with the community, working with the police, working with our prosecutors, and, in fact, working with the federal government," Bowser told MSNBC. On Saturday, Trump said the nation’s capital has become “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” Last week he threatened to deploy the National Guard to D.C. And that also includes the graffiti that you see, the papers all over the place, the roads that are in bad shape, the medians that are falling down, the median in between roads, it's falling down,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. And that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last week, “Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long. President Trump is committed to making our Nation’s capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.” The seven-day law enforcement effort is being led by the U.S. Park Police but includes personnel from the Metro Transit Police Department, Amtrak Police Department, United States Capitol Police, Washington’s Metro Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Protective Service, Enforcement and Removal Operations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, United States Marshals Service, United States Attorney’s Office-District of Columbia, Department of Interior, Pre-Trial Services Agency, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), the White House official said.

In the meantime, economists say the talks — which take place as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine, with no ceasefire deal in sight — are already a win for Putin and his war-centered economy that is laboring under international sanctions and stubbornly high inflation of 9.4% in June. this is a weak economy," Portes told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition." Coming into talks with a strong position in the battlefield, Russia is likely to want immediate sanctions relief as part of any ceasefire deal, as well as Ukrainian territorial concessions. Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov on Saturday stated that "the economic interests of our countries intersect in Alaska and the Arctic, and there are prospects for implementing large-scale and mutually beneficial projects," the Kremlin stated. Portes said that if Trump "had the patience and the willingness to apply sanctions properly, then waiting [to hold talks] would result in a very significant change in the balance of forces." As things stand, however, Trump has mulled but so far held off on increasing sanctions on Russia. Washington has instead threatened the Kremlin's remaining trading partners, such as India, with "secondary sanctions" and additional trade tariffs for continuing with purchases of Russian oil, which have funded Moscow's war machine.

Article: But Paulson was shocked and flooded with memories when, just two weeks ago, he saw his former friend’s name in the headlines after police found the 34-year-old dead inside his Harlem apartment. Courtesy Joshua Baker When authorities entered the apartment on July 31 after Donald called for help, they found Jacob slumped over his toilet with a gash on his head and multiple stab wounds to the back of his leg, one deep enough to penetrate muscle, according to charging documents. In the days since his death, Paulson and seven others who knew Jacob spoke with NBC News as they slowly learned about the personal trainer’s life over the last decade. And while his fatal stabbing comes as a shock, those who knew Jacob believe Donald cut out his friends — and potential lifelines — years before he truly needed them. Paulson and Baker said that the trio never went “anywhere without each other” and spent endless days cooped up in Jacob’s Hell’s Kitchen apartment, which they say overlooked Central Park, playing video games, eating fried food, and daydreaming about their futures. A prominent New York City drag queen who uses they/them pronouns, Cummings said Jacob would frequently walk them between gigs late at night to make sure they got there safely. Jonathan Starkey, a friend from Texas, recalled that in one conversation around that time, Jacob said that “a lot had changed, and that Donald was a little possessive and jealous and kind of restricted who he was in touch with.” “Jacob wasn’t really someone who let people tell him what to do, which is why it’s so strange,” Starkey said. “He’s decided to break away from his past, which unfortunately included his closest friends, in order to move forward with a healthy life.” “He’s been very focused and is back on the right track in his life and in order to remain focused he will remain out of contact for the moment,” Donald added. For years, the only updates Jacob’s friends received about their friend came through social media, where images from the couple’s Instagrams showed what appeared to be a happy couple who traveled the world and lived a glamorous New York life. Prosecutors said in the charging documents filed after Jacob’s death that Donald had nine domestic incident reports filed against him since 2022, but did not provide more details about the nature of the incidents or who filed them. In November 2024, an order of protection was issued in New York County Criminal Court that directed Donald to cease communication and stay away from Jacob, according to charging documents associated with Donald’s arrest in February. The court records allege that Donald held a knife in Jacob’s direction and said, “I will attack you.” He pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is still pending. When police arrived, they found Donald sitting on their couch with three cuts to his arm that later required stitches, a black eye, and bite marks, according to a criminal complaint. However, prosecutors say that Jacob called his father from the bathroom before the attack and allegedly told him that Donald “was coming at him with knives and preventing him from leaving the apartment,” according to the criminal complaint.

Article: It seems President Trump’s meeting with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, which included receiving a gold-and-glass statue from him at the White House last Wednesday, was not his most significant interaction with a top US exec that day. Yesterday, the Financial Times and the New York Times reported that POTUS also met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who offered to give the US 15% of revenue from selling AI chips to China in exchange for…the export licenses required to sell said chips to China. Heart of the deal Nvidia’s agreement revolves around its H20 AI chip, which has been in the news a lot: Nvidia specifically developed it for the Chinese market after President Biden introduced export controls in 2022 to keep more advanced US chips out of China. In July, the Trump administration announced it would allow Nvidia to sell the H20 to China again, but it didn’t grant the licenses for that until the end of last week. The Trump admin also banned exports of it to China in April, and it will receive export licenses again for the same terms, according to both the NYT and the FT. The Commerce Department, the White House, and AMD did not provide comment to the New York Times, but Nvidia Spokesperson Ken Brown told the outlet, “We hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” Big picture: After months of cutting deals with foreign nations about tariff rates for imports coming into the US, Trump negotiating for the government to share revenue with US companies for items going out is unprecedented.—HVL

Article: Ten years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision. Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees. In a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses. More fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was "egregiously wrong." "The mistake must be corrected," wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell "legal fiction." The petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, with son Nathan Davis, a deputy clerk, reads a statement to the media outside the Rowan County Courthouse in Morehead, Ky., on September 14, 2015. Pablo Alcala/Lexington Herald-Leader/Tribune News Service via Getty Image "If there ever was a case of exceptional importance," Staver wrote, "the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it." Lower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk "cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect." Davis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention," said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News. A renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent Davis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy. So far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal. Scott Olson/Getty Images Support for equal marriage rights softening While a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020. The justices "should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell," Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights. "It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now," said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law. "It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement." Ruling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages If the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law. There are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Chief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as "an act of will, not legal judgment" with "no basis in the Constitution." He also warned then that it "creates serious questions about religious liberty." Davis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year.

Article: The plan follows a deliberate sequence: First destroy, then starve, occupy, demand demilitarisation, and finally carry out full ethnic cleansing once Palestinians have no political power and capacity to resist. On Sunday, the Israeli army assassinated Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa by dropping a missile on a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital. Advertisement The footage shocked viewers across the world and so the Israeli government was quick to ban filming on these flights, warning that aid drops would be halted if there were any violations. So before that day arrives, Israel is racing to erase the evidence because once the world sees Gaza, it will no longer be able to pretend that the war was about anything other than the mass killing of Palestinians and the erasure of their history. It has buried massacred civilians in mass graves with bulldozers; it has withheld bodies of Palestinian torture victims; it has dug into the sand whole crime scenes of execution; it has planted weapons in hospitals that it has ransacked; it has lied about discovering tunnels. Some of the documents that have disappeared give gruesome details about the brutality of Zionist fighters during massacres of Palestinians, like in the village of Dawaymeh, near Hebron, where hundreds of Palestinian men, women, and children were killed by artillery fire or directly executed. Journalists thus become mouthpieces for the Israeli military, parroting their justifications for wholesale destruction and propagating their lies about Palestinian civilians as “human shields” and Gaza hospitals and schools as “terror hubs”. Israel used this strategy early into the genocide, dropping leaflets warning Palestinians in northern Gaza that they will be deemed “partners in a terrorist organisation” if they do not comply with “evacuation orders”. Germany went as far as halting military exports that could be used in Gaza – something that should have been done 22 months ago, when Israel started indiscriminately bombing civilians. It must undertake military intervention, as mandated under international law, to force Israel to immediately end the violence, to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to give Palestinians the freedom they are entitled to.

Article: Below are a few of the responses to the killing of Al Jazeera staff: Palestine The Palestinian mission to the United Nations accused Israel of “deliberately assassinating” al-Sharif and Qreiqeh, describing them as among the “last remaining journalists” in Gaza. “As Israel continues to ethnically cleanse Gaza, its enemy remains the truth: the brave journalists exposing its heinous crimes.” Iran Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei has called on the world to hold Israel to account after the killing of the five Al Jazeera staff. “In Gaza, and everywhere, media workers should be able to carry out their work freely and without harassment, intimidation or fear of being targeted.” Al Jazeera Media Network Al Jazeera Media Network has condemned “in the strongest terms” the killing of its journalists in a targeted assassination by Israeli forces. The strike came amid what Al Jazeera described as the “catastrophic consequences” of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, including mass civilian deaths, forced starvation, and the destruction of entire communities. “This is part of a pattern … going back decades, in which it kills journalists.” Amnesty International Amnesty International condemned the strike as a war crime under international law and remembered al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter. At great risk to their lives, they have remained to show the world the war crimes being committed by Israel against almost two million Palestinian women, men and children,” he added. National Press Club Mike Balsamo, president of the US-based National Press Club, said the killing of journalists is “a loss felt far beyond one newsroom” and urged a “thorough and transparent” investigation. “All parties in conflict zones must honour their obligations under international law to protect reporters and ensure they can carry out their work safely.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned Israel’s killing of five Al Jazeera journalists and called on US and international media workers to “stand in solidarity” with their Palestinian colleagues. “The murder of these Al Jazeera journalists is not an accident or collateral damage – it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.

(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) — India ’s opposition parties held a protest Monday calling for the rollback of a controversial revision of the voter list in one of the country’s poorest states, where key elections are scheduled in November, and warning it could lead to voter disenfranchisement. Hundreds of lawmakers and supporters began the protest from parliament and were confronted by police, who stopped them from marching towards the election commission office in the capital, New Delhi. India's opposition accuses the Election Commission of India of rushing through a mammoth electoral roll revision in eastern Bihar state, saying the exercise could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. The revision of nearly 80 million voters involves strict documentation requirements from citizens, triggering concerns it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, especially those who are unable to produce the paperwork required to prove their citizenship. The election agency has denied the allegations and said it has ensured no eligible voter is “left behind." It has also said the “intensive revision” is a routine update to ensure the accuracy of electoral rolls and is needed to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants." According to the commission, some 49.6 million voters whose names were included in a similar exercise in 2003 are not required to submit any further documents. Modi's BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. Critics and opposition leaders have warned that the exercise is similar to that of a controversial 2019 citizenship list in India's eastern Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness. Gandhi, the opposition leader, made public last week his Congress Party's analysis from southern Karnataka state that alleged nearly 100,000 votes cast for an assembly seat in the 2024 general election were fraudulent.

Article: The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest maritime routes, which Beijing claims almost entirely despite an international ruling that the assertion has no legal basis. “The China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” Gan Yu, a Chinese coastguard spokesperson, said in a statement. “The [Chinese coastguard vessel] CCG 3104, which was chasing the [Philippine coastguard vessel] BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the [Philippine] vessel’s starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] Navy warship,” spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country’s patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend and exercise Manila’s sovereign rights over what it considers to be part of its territory. Marcos also addressed another source of tension with Beijing, stating China has “misinterpreted” his recent comments saying Manila would be inevitably drawn into a conflict between China and Taiwan should one erupt. China accused Marcos of “playing with fire” after the Philippine leader said during a visit to India that “there is no way that the Philippines can stay out of it” due to its proximity to Taiwan.

Article: A staff member for Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath emailed the county’s newly established Emergency Centralized Response Center, asking for a cleanup of a reoccurring homeless encampment along a rail line in the San Fernando Valley. Advertisement It was all in preparation for the day in late July when crews would arrive to the train tracks and throw away tarps and tents, and remove a makeshift electrical line residents set up to siphon power from the grid. County’s Emergency Centralized Response Center launched in January with a goal of better coordinating the various efforts among different government agencies and nonprofits to clean encampments, get people healthcare and into temporary or permanent housing. The dispatch center was established following a request from Supervisors Horvath and Kathryn Barger and is part of a larger stated effort to increase accountability and coordination when it comes to homeless services, including a new county homeless department that will launch next year. Advertisement In the supervisors’ motion requesting the response center, they said there previously wasn’t one entity tasked “to oversee and direct daily operations for unhoused individuals across Los Angeles County” — no small problem when different county departments, federal agencies, state agencies and 88 cities are involved. (David Butow/For The Times) When an encampment popped up, officials said multiple agencies would receive requests for service and then act on their own, resulting in multiple outreach teams dispatched to the same location, without knowledge someone else had been there before. Sometimes, a state agency would clean an encampment on its property, but not notify the local agency that owned the adjacent property, allowing residents to move their encampment there, said Donald Holt, principal analyst with ECRC. Now, the county says ECRC overseas more than 150 outreach teams across 11 organizations and coordinates with multiple government agencies that offer housing and conduct cleanups to ensure they are working together. “It wasn’t until this center came together that that coordination was really put into action in the ways we all expected.” Based in an office at the downtown Hall of Administration, center staff handle requests for service from elected officials, the public and government agencies and then coordinate cleanups and work to find housing, as well as needed medical care. (David Butow/For The Times) In addition to eight analysts dedicated to managing requests for specific regions of the county, workers at the center include staff from the county’s Housing for Health, Department of Mental Health, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the Department of Military & Veterans Affair, among others. “That would have taken me six hours.” Advertisement On a recent Tuesday, staff started the day in a meeting where they updated one another on requests for service, including instances where people were successfully moved into housing and others where the effort was still underway. (David Franco/County of Los Angeles) Shortly after the meeting, Chung’s supervisor Lisa Speights stopped by the cubicle of Maribel Lozano-Hernandez with the county’s Housing for Health program to discuss a housing request that came in within the last 24 hours. Three weeks ago , outreach workers from LA Family Housing, arrived to speak with residents, remind them of the following day’s cleanup and encourage them to sign forms to get into housing. (County of Los Angeles) Outreach workers had already been on site around five times and had already located housing options for some of the people living in roughly 10 tents and makeshift structures. Residents Jose Duran and his partner Melanie Morales said they moved onto the streets a few months ago when they couldn’t pay rent after Duran fell from a three story building and could no longer work construction. Speaking as trains zoomed past, Duran said after he fell from a ladder, his foot became infected and he received skin grafts to fix it, but still needs another surgery. According to a county spokesperson, workers removed “four makeshift shelters or tents and ten cubic yards of debris.” Duran and Morales weren’t housed that day and said they were told there wasn’t beds currently available. Rachel Kassenbrock, the county spokesperson, said on the day of the cleanup ten people from the encampment weren’t immediately able to be housed, but put on a wait list until beds became available, including Duran and Morales.

Article: For months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools. The morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.” Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom’s comments and legal threat. Advertisement The developments bring the fight over America’s higher education institutions — which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months — to the nation’s most powerful and lauded public university system. And what role will money — taxpayer money — play?” California is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls “Marxist” universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars. Advertisement His administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide — Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses — of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.” What’s at stake Since July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions — totaling nearly half a billion dollars — UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy. Advertisement UCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said. They hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations. The NSF letter said that UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.” What Trump wants Federal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations. The settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments. “It’s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words ‘UCLA.’ ” What comes next The 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC. Advertisement In an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were “clearly illegal” because “the president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.” He outlined what would likely be California’s argument in a suit: The government’s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized. “Agencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are ‘arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.’ Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.” Negotiations still possible But California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration’s orders. When Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over. California “might do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don’t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.” Advertisement After Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table — but not on the current “unacceptable” terms. “The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said. The fact that UC is a public university system adds to the complexities.” Mitchell, the American Council on Education president and former top administrator of Occidental College, said a quick resolution would benefit both sides. He said a months-long process — as it’s been between Harvard and Trump — would have the potential for “great harm.” “These things, the longer they go on, the worse they get,” he said.

Article: Less than a week after he responded to a disappointing jobs report by firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Trump showed reporters a handful of charts with data he liked much more. This combination limits policymakers’ options: Most tools to fight inflation (such raising interest rates) risk hurting economic growth, while most tools to boost growth (such as increased government spending) risk increasing inflation. At the same time, in addition to the slowing pace of job creation, GDP growth averaged 1.3% for the first half of the year, down sharply from the last couple years. Graham wrote, “some peculiar views about women, both related and unrelated to the economy.” The issue in his record most relevant to Thursday’s presentation is Moore’s relationship with the truth.

Article: There’s a genre of conspiracy theory that goes like this: A politician, faced with a particularly uncomfortable or embarrassing scandal, manufactures another story — a distraction — to divert attention and alleviate pressure on themselves. In 1998, congressional Republicans suggested President Bill Clinton had deployed missiles to Sudan and Afghanistan to change the subject away from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which he had admitted to three days earlier. — known for his anti-vaccine congressional hearings and a backyard watermelon ballistics test aimed at proving a former White House aide’s suicide was actually a murder — said at the time, “I’d hate to think this was a ‘Wag the Dog’ type thing,” referencing the 1997 dark comedy in which a president fabricates a war with Albania to distract from a sex scandal. At gaggles, in interviews and on his social media platform, he has made explicit his desire to shift attention away from Jeffrey Epstein — the disgraced financier found dead from suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. As a reminder, in July, Epstein again took over the national narrative when the Department of Justice, after months spent dangling the promise of new revelations, published a memo stating that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted, there was no client list to pursue and that Epstein had, in fact, killed himself. Mainstream press took up the subject, too, in coverage that revealed new details of the friendship between Epstein and Trump and followed the fight for the release of the so-called Epstein files as was being called for by a strange new consortium of Democrats, MAGA followers and some of Epstein’s victims. In the weeks since, Trump has openly attempted to redirect the national conversation, insisting people focus instead on flooding in Texas, or America’s success, or most recently, the revival of a familiar conspiracy theory: that Obama and the intelligence community framed Russia for interfering in the 2016 election all in an effort to undermine Trump’s presidency. “People should really focus on how well the country is doing, or they should focus on the fact that Barack Hussein Obama led a coup,” Trump said in July, when asked about Epstein. spy agencies to manufacture a narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf — a “hoax” the current president has railed against for years, claiming it was orchestrated to undermine him. Gabbard announced on July 18 that she had found evidence of “a treasonous conspiracy,” that the Obama administration “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Trump.” The Russiagate rollout has been a slow burn. After her initial claim on July 18 came the release of a declassified 5-year-old Republican House Intelligence Committee report on July 23, a whistleblower twist on July 30, the release of a formerly classified annex on July 31, and finally, reports that Attorney General Pam Bondi had launched a grand jury investigation based on Gabbard’s reports, targeting not just Obama, but also his former directors of national intelligence, the CIA and the FBI. Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement the claims were “outrageous,” “bizarre” and “a weak attempt at distraction.” The New York Times reported the newly declassified documents, in fact, disproved Gabbard’s allegations, noting the emails presented as smoking guns by right-wing media were almost certainly fabrications made by Russian spies. The Bulwark’s Cathy Young called the releases “a nothingburger.” And Renée DiResta, an associate research professor at Georgetown and a contributing editor at Lawfare, likened it to an attack “by document — flooding the zone with memos and annexes most people on X will never read, relying instead on influencers and partisan media to shape the narrative for them.” Multiple investigations — including a 2017 Intelligence Community assessment, special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report, a 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee review and special counsel John Durham’s 2023 report — have all concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Trump. None of the inquiries, including Durham’s, which was tasked with looking for it, has ever presented evidence of a plot by Obama administration officials to sabotage Trump or to fabricate intelligence. The same evening Gabbard made her announcement, mentions of Epstein among right-wing influencers on X dropped off, according to data compiled by University of Washington professor and disinformation expert Kate Starbird. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to let the Epstein Files go, because there’s justice that needs to be served there,” said Liz Wheeler, a MAGA podcaster who was among the first and loudest critics of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein affair. “But something bigger broke since then, and it’s been more important to us for a long time.” Wheeler, who was among a handful of influencers invited to the White House in February and photographed holding binders of already-public Epstein documents, said the new Russiagate investigation didn’t distract her — it confirmed that Trump was listening to his base and delivering on their demands for justice, of some kind. Longtime conspiracy theory researcher Travis View, co-host of the “QAnon Anonymous” podcast and a producer at Cursed Media, said that even the most Epstein-obsessed, conspiracy-addled faction of MAGA had been pulled in by Gabbard’s revelations. He can promise a special investigation and keep people in perpetual suspense of the big reveal that never comes.” Trump’s pivot to Russiagate, View said, is a cleaner narrative — especially given his uncomfortable association with Epstein. For those of us who still believe in quaint ideas like karma or shame — the regular folks forced to face the consequences of our own actions — it’s maddening to watch as Trump once again seems poised to slip free from another mess of his own making. While the MAGA outrage has shifted — away from Trump and Epstein, and onto a narrative with familiar bad guys and less of the mess — the mainstream press won’t let go. “It’s put out by the Democrats because we’ve had the most successful six months in the history of our country, and that’s just a way of trying to divert attention to something that’s total bullshit, OK?”

Article: Texas Legislature to take another swing at redistricting vote as Democrats extend their walkout Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. "If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on "Fox News Sunday." When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate - such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California - Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. "They know that they're going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they're trying to steal seats," Pritzker said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful." President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia "safer and more beautiful than it ever was before." "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump wrote Sunday. We're going to put you in jail where you belong." Last week the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option "to extend as needed." On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was "ridiculous" and the city was "unsafe," after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. "I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard," she said Sunday on MSNBC's "The Weekend," acknowledging it is "the president's call about how to deploy the Guard." Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as "one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, "Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false." Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are all down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Trump offered no details in Truth Social posts over the weekend about possible new actions to address crime levels that he argues are dangerous for citizens, tourists and workers alike. The president criticized the district as full of "tents, squalor, filth, and Crime," and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. The president called Bowser "a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances." Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: Brown | AFP | Getty Images On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the "electric vehicle mandate" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax-and-spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives. Despite the automaker touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000. Jacobson said last month that GM has an "inherent advantage" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings. Ford Motor Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's July 30 call with analysts that it has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation "pretty massively" as a result of softer regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

Article: Netanyahu defends new military offensive in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel "has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas." Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the "central camps" and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a "targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign." Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his "steadfast support." Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a "global campaign of lies," Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation." Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to "bring in more foreign journalists" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. "But I have no other choice to feed the kids." Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: "There were no incidents at or near our sites today." Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said artificial general intelligence, or "AGI," is losing its relevance as a term as rapid advances in the space make it harder to define the concept. "I think it's not a super useful term," Altman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. The AI entrepreneur has previously said he thinks AGI could be developed in the "reasonably close-ish future." The problem with AGI, Altman said, is that there are multiple definitions being used by different companies and individuals. One definition is an AI that can do "a significant amount of the work in the world," according to Altman — however, that has its issues because the nature of work is constantly changing. "I think the point of all of this is it doesn't really matter and it's just this continuing exponential of model capability that we'll rely on for more and more things," Altman said.

Article: The president said the subject of news conference will "not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." The event comes a week after the president again threatened a federal takeover of D.C. In recent days, the president boosted the federal law enforcement presence in D.C., which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt framed as a "first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, DC." Trump also has the authority to take control of the local police, but Congress would need to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which granted D.C. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said in an MSNBC interview yesterday that she thinks Trump will announce he is surging federal law enforcement in the capital and pushed back on the assertion that D.C. “If the priority is to show force in an American city, we know [Trump] can do that here, but it won’t be because there’s a spike in crime,” Bowser said. The president said on Truth Social that he would also discuss plans to make the district "more beautiful than it ever was before," which would include removing homeless people from the city. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong." In a separate post to Truth Social, Trump indicated he would also focus on "the Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital." He then referred to the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, which he has previously criticized, saying it "could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner" for far less money.

Article: As people rushed to help, it became apparent that five Al Jazeera staff had been killed, including Anas al-Sharif, one of the most famous faces of Arabic reporting from Gaza. The tent was where they worked, as journalists in Gaza have gathered at hospitals to seek better electricity and internet connections, a fact that has been well-known since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza. “I’m not far from al-Shifa Hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa Hospital,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reported yesterday. “I could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa Hospital.” What happened? Shortly before being killed, al-Sharif wrote on X that Israel had launched intense, concentrated bombardment – also known as “fire belts” – on the eastern and southern parts of Gaza City. “[I thought] all our colleagues were martyred.” Al-Sultan added that he wasn’t sure who the journalists were who were in the tent, but “when I started filming, I saw our colleagues Anas al-Sharif was on the ground and Mohammed Qreiqeh, who was on fire. “We started to pull him out and try to put out the fire.” The people gathered there tried to get Qreiqeh inside al-Shifa Hospital, but he succumbed to his wounds before they could get him treatment, al-Sultan said. Israel’s army posted about deliberately killing the journalists, claiming it had wanted to kill al-Sharif, who it accused of being an armed commander for Hamas only posing as a journalist. Two of the most prominent incidents included journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh, and journalist Hossam Shabat, who were both assassinated by Israel and accused of being members of Hamas without any evidence. Israel has banned international media from entering Gaza since October 2023, but “Al Jazeera journalists remained within besieged Gaza … [delivering] searing eyewitness accounts of the horrors unleashed over 22 months of relentless bombing and destruction,” the statement said. Israel ramped up a smear campaign on al-Sharif in recent months, with army spokesperson Avichay Adraee calling out al-Sharif by name in a video on X last month, accusing him of being part of Hamas’s military wing.

Article: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person overnight as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit between Putin and Trump. KYIV, Ukraine -- A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two more in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, the region's governor said Monday, as fighting continued ahead of a planned summit meeting in which Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to persuade his U.S. A Ukrainian official said at least four drones launched by the country's security services, or SBU, struck a plant in the city of Arzamas that produced components for the Khinzal 32 and Khinzal 101 missiles. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an "absolutely legitimate target" because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Donald Trump will host in Alaska later this week, sees Putin unwavering on his maximalist demands to keep all the Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy but also to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO with the long-term aim to keep the country under Moscow's sphere of influence. Spokesman Steffen Meyer reiterated that the German government "has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate "independently and autonomously." Meanwhile on the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war, other than a brief respite before Moscow resumes its attacks with even greater might.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) FILE - Federal agents escort a family to a transport bus after they were detained following an appearance at immigration court, July 22, 2025, in San Antonio, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House's border security and mass deportation agenda. The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget. The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.” The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said. But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall. “We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated" through the new law. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.” All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.” As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

Article: President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is "the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an “absolutely legitimate target” because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Donald Trump will host in Alaska later this week, sees Putin unwavering on his maximalist demands to keep all the Ukrainian territory his forces now occupy but also to prevent Kyiv from joining NATO with the long-term aim to keep the country under Moscow's sphere of influence. Spokesman Steffen Meyer reiterated that the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Meanwhile on the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war, other than a brief respite before Moscow resumes its attacks with even greater might.

Article: A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended A pause on higher tariffs for China is due to expire Tuesday. (Chinatopix Via AP) TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A 90-day pause on imposing higher tariffs on China is due to expire on Tuesday and it is unclear if it will be extended. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl. But he said Trump “hasn't made any firm decisions.” Prohibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez, file) Texas Republicans will again try to convene the state Legislature Monday for a vote on redrawing congressional maps in their party's favor, an effort that already sparked a national political brawl and prompted Democratic lawmakers to leave the state to deny Republicans the quorum they need. Now, Democratic-controlled states including California, New York and Illinois are threatening to retaliate against Texas and Trump by proposing their own redistricting, putting the nation on the brink of a tit-for-tat overhaul of congressional boundaries that are typically redrawn only once a decade. JB Pritzker at news conferences — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking the state's Supreme Court to remove some of them from office or give them a 48-hour warning to return. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol," said Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” When pressed about blue states' threats to retaliate — such as Newsom's proposal to effectiveely cut five GOP-held seats in California — Abbott argued that many had already squeezed the juice out of their gerrymandering and would be hard-pressed to push it further. “They know that they’re going to lose in 2026 the Congress, and so they’re trying to steal seats,” Pritzker said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” Past attempts by Texas Democrats to halt votes by leaving the state were typically unsuccessful, and several of the blue states face more hurdles to redistricting than Texas does.

Article: Iran's Foreign Ministry says talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency will be "technical" and "complicated." Iran says talks with IAEA will be 'technical' and 'complicated' ahead of agency's planned visit TEHRAN -- Talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will be “technical” and "complicated," the Islamic Republic’s Foreign Ministry said Monday ahead of a visit by the nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with the organization last month. Esmail Baghaei, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters there could be a meeting with Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks.” Baghaei also criticized the IAEA's “unique situation” during the June war with Israel. "Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Aragchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West, and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. intelligence agencies and the IAEA had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Peruvian President Dina Boluarte met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Monday during a visit aimed at strengthening economic ties as the two countries look to expand into new markets amid geopolitical challenges and rising trade barriers. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May 2024 on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. “The CEPA is a testament to the determination of our governments to promote freer trade and strengthen our economies,” Boluarte said in a joint news conference with Subianto after the meeting, adding that the deal can promoting the exchange of goods and laying the foundations for future agreements. Boluarte said Indonesia has become a key partner for Peru in Southeast Asia, and said her visit to the fourth most populous country in the world and one of the most dynamic emerging economies in Asia was an excellent moment to reaffirm their commitment to full observance of international law, free trade, South-South cooperation, food security and sustainable development. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” said Indonesia's trade minister, Budi Santoso, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry's data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel.

The city of Milwaukee and its surrounding suburbs were still trying to dry out Sunday night after getting hit with more than a foot of water from a historic rainfall that caused flash flooding, taking many by surprise. "We were up 2, 3 in the morning outside just watching it creep closer and closer and then recede, so we were one of the fortunate ones." Thousands of other Milwaukee County residents were not so lucky The night of the storm, sewers were operating in reverse, pushing out flood waters into people's yards.

Article: In late January, just two days after his second presidential inaugural, Donald Trump told Russia that if it failed to end its war in Ukraine quickly, the White House “would have no other choice” but to impose new economic sanctions. Nearly two weeks ago, on July 29, the American president brought new specificity to his threat, telling reporters that Putin’s regime had just 10 days to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine — the neighboring country it invaded three years ago — or the United States would impose new economic penalties on Russia. Those who predicted that Trump was serious — this time would be different from all of those other times; this time Putin had gone too far and earned the American president’s contempt — were predictably wrong. NBC News reported: Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Complicating matters further, the Republican announced that he was welcoming Putin to American soil — the two are now scheduled to meet in Alaska on Friday — handing Moscow a related diplomatic coup. (Because the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children, the Russian dictator generally hasn’t been able to travel outside of his own country. The American president nevertheless invited him to the U.S.) Just days earlier, the official White House line was that Trump was willing to meet with the Russian leader, but only if Putin agreed to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump not only abandoned his own sanctions deadline (again), not only invited Putin onto American soil in exchange for nothing, and not only gave an international pariah the legitimacy he craves, he also took some time at a White House event on Friday to assure the world that Putin “wants to see peace.” Russia’s war — which has intensified during Trump’s second term — clearly proves otherwise, and Trump himself has repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that Putin most certainly does not want peace. At the same White House event on Friday afternoon, the American president also suggested that Ukraine might have to agree to let Russia keep some of the Ukrainian territory that the Russian military took by force. is “done with the funding of the Ukraine war business.” And around the same time, Matthew Whitaker, the administration’s unfortunate NATO ambassador, suggested on CNN that Russia would likely be rewarded with Ukrainian territory it “earned on the battlefield.” About a month ago, after Trump teased a “major statement” about U.S. Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at Kings College London, told the Times, “It has been a very good week for Putin.” There’s ample evidence to bolster the point, though I’d add that with Trump in the White House, it’s been a very good seven months for Putin, too.

The opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, claims the ruling party and the election commission are jointly manipulating elections through obscure additions and deletions to voter rolls. The issue gained momentum after a sudden revision of voter rolls ahead of elections in Bihar, the eastern state of over 130 million that is expected to elect its local government in November. Modi’s party said was to clear the rolls of “infiltrators.” But the opposition sees it as a way of disenfranchising the state’s Muslim voters and other blocs hostile to their Hindu nationalist policies.

The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

At the time, there was no suggestion that the resumption of sales to China would come with conditions or any kind of revenue forfeiture, and the step was celebrated by markets because of the billions of dollars worth of potential sales to China that were back on the table.

Article: Under CEO Matt Baer, a former Walmart and Macy's executive who was tapped to helm the business in June 2023, Stitch Fix posted its first revenue growth in 12 straight quarters for the three months ended May 3. The company, which charges a $20 styling fee for all "fixes" it sends, saw revenue per active client grow to $542 during its most recent quarter, up 3% from the year-ago period. "It's been really affirming to us that, you know, with this return to growth, with this increase in engagement, with this increase in average order value, that we do have the right strategy," Baer told CNBC in an interview. "We've got the right team and we're executing against it at a high level as well." Stitch Fix hasn't posted an annual profit since 2019 but for three straight quarters, its year-over-year losses have narrowed. To be sure, Stitch Fix's sales growth in its fiscal third quarter was modest, up just 0.7%, but it expects those gains to continue in its current quarter with sales projected to be flat to up 1.7% year over year. The rise and fall Retail and restaurant consultant Katrina Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 with the mission to combine data with personalized styling to develop a shopping experience that actually felt individualized at scale. In a world where shoppers regularly groan about the banality of modern-day shopping, Stitch Fix sought to be the panacea by offering accessible personal stylists that could design and ship outfits specific to a customer's unique needs and preferences. Source: Nasdaq But then the market grew crowded and suddenly, customers found themselves overwhelmed by all of the companies looking to sell them a monthly subscription box, whether it was a package of clothes, beauty products or dog treats. In January 2023, StitchFix announced that CEO Elizabeth Spaulding would be stepping down and Lake would return to the helm as its interim CEO and lead the search process for a new top executive. But Baer's career in retail started long before that: At 16, he started working in his family business, Baer's Furniture & Interior Design, a small chain of furniture stores dotted along the Florida coasts and founded by his great-grandfather in 1945. I was able to understand their needs and translate that into an exceptional service that we could provide." Matt Baer, CEO of Stitch Fix Courtesy: Stitch Fix Baer said his first order of business after taking over at Stitch Fix was to understand the company's primary client and how that shopper was experiencing the service. In Stitch Fix's early days, customers had one option – five items in a box at a recurring cadence with one discount mechanism – but these days, there's less rigidity. Customers can order a fix on demand, opt in for regular deliveries or shop through Stitch Fix's "freestyle" catalog, which allows them to instantly select and buy pieces based on their style profile. With no physical retail presence, Stitch Fix's online customer acquisition is expensive and the company has to manage the headaches of packing individual boxes and then processing the stream of free returns that come when clients don't like the items that came with their fix. Courtesy: Stitch Fix Another primary area of focus was adjusting Stitch Fix's assortment and revamping its private brand portfolio, which comes at a higher margin and makes up between 40% and 50% of sales, according to Stich Fix. More than two years into his tenure, Baer said he's still attending monthly client focus groups and styling fixes for customers "nearly every day," which he said allows him to stay close to customers. "One client, she lives in Letcher, South Dakota, population 159, and it's only because of Stitch Fix that she has access to these brands, that she has the ability to wear product and clothes that are differentiated, unique and special within her community," said Baer. "That feels great when I give her that confidence, when I'm able to create that joy for her." More work ahead Stitch Fix's turnaround comes at a difficult time for the apparel industry. Shoppers are more selective than ever with their discretionary dollars, and Stitch Fix's $20 styling fee can feel unnecessary when customers can purchase many of the same items the retailer offers right off the rack and directly from the brand. In a June research note, financial firm Mizuho Securities said Stitch Fix's growth in average order value is expected to dissipate in fiscal 2026 as it laps its expansion into larger fixes. "While management attributed outsized growth to more opportunistic spend and some natural investment cycle, we caution whether it's becoming more expensive to keep the active customer base engaged," Mizuho analyst David Bellinger wrote.

Article: Dame Stephanie 'Steve' Shirley, technology pioneer, dies aged 91 27 minutes ago Share Save Zoe Kleinman • @zsk Technology editor Share Save AFP via Getty Images Visionary tech pioneer and philanthropist Dame Stephanie Shirley has died at the age of 91. The boundary-breaking entrepreneur arrived in London at the age of five, just weeks before the outbreak of World War Two, and went on to become a computer industry and women's rights pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s. She founded the software company Freelance Programmers in 1962, which shook up the tech industry by almost exclusively hiring women, and in later life donated almost £70m to help those with autism and to IT projects. He had hoped that being in a position of power would protect his family, but as the Nazi government increased its persecution of German Jews, they fled to the Austrian capital Vienna. She was one of thousands of Jewish children fleeing the Nazis and came to Britain as part of the Kindertransport - a British rescue effort in the months preceding World War 2 which brought 10,000 children to the UK - where she was brought up by loving foster parents. Dame Stephanie Shirley Dame Stephanie (left) and her sister, pictured with their German father and Austrian mother, who put them on a Kindertransport train to escape Nazi-occupied Austria Determined not to be defined by her traumatic childhood, Dame Stephanie founded a company designed to provide jobs for women with children. After starting out as a scientific civil servant, in 1962 she founded software company Freelance Programmers - later known as FI Group, later still Xansa - something which was almost unheard of for a woman to do in the 1960s. Her late son Giles was autistic and she was an early member of the National Autistic Society, with her charity the Shirley Foundation funding many projects particularly related to autism.

Article: During a recent “expletive-laden address” at the Army War College, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted, “We are laser-focused on our mission of warfighting.” The former Fox News host did not, however, specify which war, exactly, he’s eager to win. The beleaguered Pentagon chief doesn’t even seem especially embarrassed about his culture-war focus, boasting on Fox News last week that he’s focused of late on things like “statues” and “paintings.” How do these efforts advance the nation’s national security goals? Late last week, Hegseth also used his social media account to amplify a video about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote. While it’s important to emphasize that Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the idea of repealing voting rights for American women, he nevertheless thought it’d be a good idea to promote the video, alongside his own written message that read, “All of Christ for All of Life.” What’s more, the secretary’s office didn’t make much of an effort to distance himself from the video Hegseth amplified. Four days into Donald Trump’s second term, 50 Senate Republicans overlooked Hegseth’s record and radicalism and confirmed him to serve in one of the most important and powerful positions in the United States government.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city’s mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” Ahead of that news conference, Trump said Monday on social media that the nation’s capital would “LIBERATED today!” He said he would end the “days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move also comes as he has sought to consolidate more of society’s power under the White House in ways that raise fundamental questions about how the federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s military targeted and killed an Al Jazeera correspondent and others with an airstrike late Sunday in Gaza, after press advocates said an Israeli “smear campaign” stepped up when Anas al-Sharif cried on air over starvation in the territory. READ MORE: Netanyahu defends military expansion in Gaza and says it will be wider than announced Both Israel and hospital officials in Gaza City confirmed the deaths of al-Sharif and colleagues, which the Committee to Protect Journalists and others described as retribution against those documenting the war in Gaza. The airstrike came less than a year after Israeli army officials first accused al-Sharif and other Al Jazeera journalists of being members of the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike a “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif’s death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. WATCH: Netanyahu lashes out at critics of plan to occupy Gaza City as condemnation mounts Like al-Sharif, Shabat was among the six that Israel accused of being members of militant groups last October. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The U.N. human rights office on Monday condemned Sunday’s airstrike targeting the journalists’ tent “in grave breach of international humanitarian law.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 journalists have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Funeral-goers call to protect journalists Al-Sharif reported a nearby bombardment minutes before his death. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group’s regional director, said in a statement.

Article: Finnish authorities say they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia FILE - The Cook Islands-registered oil tanker Eagle S is anchored near the Kilpilahti port in Porvoo on the Gulf of Finland, Dec. (Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva via AP, File) HELSINKI -- Finnish authorities said Monday they have charged the captain and two senior officers of a Russia-linked vessel that damaged undersea cables last year between Finland and Estonia. The Finnish deputy prosecutor general said in a statement that charges of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications were filed against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union’s executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Monday's statement alleges that “the Eagle S, which left Russia’s Ust-Luga with a cargo of oil products, is suspected of cutting five submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland by dragging its anchor on the seabed for about 90 kilometers (56 miles)." Prosecutors said the owners of the cables have suffered a total of at least 60 million euros ($69.7 million) in repair costs. It added that the defendants "consider that Finland lacks jurisdiction in the case, as the locations of the cable damages are outside Finnish territorial waters.” The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of Estonia's electricity needs in winter, did not disrupt service, although it drove up energy prices in the Baltic nations.

A federal judge in New York on Monday rejected a request by the Justice Department to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted procurer for notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department sought the unsealing of grand jury material related to Maxwell and Epstein after harsh criticism of the Trump administration's decision not to publicly release the investigative file on Epstein.

CEO Adam Aron said the company's results are indicative of a "recovering industry-wide box office" after previously struggling to pare losses amid dual writers' and actors' strikes and an overall post-pandemic decline in movie attendance. "In so doing, we have put in place a solid foundation to capitalize on what we believe will be our industry's continued growth momentum, especially evident in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continuing deep into 2026." Aron also said the company saw consolidated admissions revenue per patron topping $12 for "the first time ever," with total consolidated revenue per patron reaching an "unprecedented" $22.26. "The combination of a resurgent box office, our unparalleled theatre footprint with premium experiences galore, our compelling marketing programs and our increasing financial strength have a flywheel impact when they all are happening simultaneously," Aron said.

Article: It's natural to feel like being a good investor means coming up with a complicated strategy that maximizes returns, Morgan Housel, author of "The Psychology of Money," said on a recent episode of The Burnouts podcast. But when it comes to investing, "the more complicated you make it, the worse you're probably going to do." Instead of chasing hot stocks or trying to time the market, the smartest approach to investing is making it as "brainless and simple and boring as you can," Housel said. "If you can be an average investor for an above-average period of time, like just earn average market returns every year for the next 20 years, you'll do amazing," Housel said. "The simple people who can be simple and average for 50 years are the ones who end up doing the best." One of the best tools for this approach is a low-cost index fund, which tracks a market index like the S&P 500 and aims to replicate its performance. Considering that even the world's most seasoned money managers struggle to consistently beat their benchmark indexes, investing to merely keep pace with the market is a savvy, low-effort approach, says Ben Smith, a certified financial planner and founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You don't have to pick and choose different stocks and be really strategic, because that often doesn't work out very well, at least for most investors." Data indicates the same: Between January 2015 and December 2024, only 7% of active mutual fund managers beat their average passive rival, according to Morningstar.

The BJP has backed the revision and said it is necessary to update new voters and delete the names of those who have either died or moved to other states. Critics and opposition leaders have also warned that the exercise is similar to that of a 2019 citizenship list in eastern India’s Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness.

Article: Trial to start on whether deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles violated federal law A federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed troops to Los Angeles. SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge in San Francisco will consider evidence and hear arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California "to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer." MORE: Another 1,350 National Guard troops being withdrawn from Los Angeles, Pentagon says The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces Training Base, in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom Newsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the Tenth Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal arguing that courts can't second guess the president's decisions and secured a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold. After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. The Trump administration's attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act "fail as a matter of law." They argued that there is a law that gives the president the authority to call on the National Guard to enforce U.S. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country "is invaded," when "there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government," or when the president is otherwise unable "to execute the laws of the United States." Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles "fall far short of 'rebellion.'" "Next week's trial is not cancelled," he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

Article: Judge denies release of Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury transcripts toggle caption New York State Sex Offender Registry/AP A federal judge in Manhattan on Monday rejected the Trump administration's request to release grand jury transcripts from Justice Department investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. "Its entire premise—that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them—is demonstrably false," Engelmayer wrote. He said the materials provide no new insight into Epstein or Maxwell clients, nor new information about the venue, new sources of their wealth, or the circumstances of Epstein's death. They promised transparency on the Epstein matter, but in July the Justice Department and FBI released a memo that knocked down several of those theories and said no further materials from the Epstein investigations would be made public, touching off public outrage including from Trump's MAGA base . In an effort to contain the fallout, the president, who knew Epstein, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts from the department's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell. Sponsor Message The department followed up by asking three federal judges — two in Manhattan and one in Florida — to unseal the grand jury transcripts from investigations into Epstein and his longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Law What it takes to release documents like the 'Epstein files' What it takes to release documents like the 'Epstein files' Listen · 5:07 5:07 Manhattan-based judge Engelmayer falls under the 2nd Circuit, where precedent allows for the public release of grand jury materials under certain special circumstances.

Article: PARIS (AP) — A heat wave gripped parts of Europe on Monday, sending temperatures up to 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 Fahrenheit) in southern France and increasing risks of wildfires in wine country, while Bulgaria suffered blazes along its southern borders and Hungary saw record-breaking weekend temperatures. READ MORE: Heat advisories, warnings issued for Southeast and Midwest as temperatures soar According to the U.K.-based Carbon Brief, 2025 is predicted to be the second- or third-warmest year on record. EU data show burned area across the continent is already far above the long-term average this summer, with major outbreaks in Spain, Portugal and deadly blazes in Greece since late June. Massive blaze in France In France’s Aude department, a patchwork of vineyards and Mediterranean scrubland, hundreds of firefighters remained in the rolling wine country guarding the edges of a massive, deadly blaze that scorched 16,000 hectares last week. On Monday, the French national weather authority, Météo-France, placed 12 departments on red alert, the country’s highest heat warning, anticipating exceptional heat stretching from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean plains. “Don’t be fooled — this isn’t ‘normal, it’s summer.’ It’s not normal, it’s a nightmare,” agricultural climatologist Serge Zaka, told BFMTV from Montauban in France’s Tarn-et-Garonne department, where the blistering heat pressed relentlessly throughout the day. Nearly 200 fires have been reported; most have been brought under control, localized and extinguished, but the situation remains “very challenging,” said Alexander Dzhartov, head of the national fire safety unit.

Article: AOL is set to shut down its dial-up internet service, ending more than three decades of the iconic symphony of beeps, screeches and static that once signaled your gateway to the World Wide Web. As a result, on September 30, 2025, this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued," the company said. Though the sluggish internet service may seem like a relic of the 1990s and early 2000s, nearly 160,000 people connect to the internet through their landline telephone service, according to 2023 data from the U.S. The acquisition, valued at $350 billion, was considered one of the biggest media mergers in history and came at the height of the "Internet bubble." The merger failed miserably due to cultural clashes between the companies and the decline of AOL's business model, leading to record losses for both companies.

Article: Rapists 'probably' forfeit right to choose gender - Sturgeon 29 minutes ago Share Save Angus Cochrane BBC News Share Save ITV News questioned the former SNP leader on the political and personal revelations in her book. The former first minister, in an interview with ITV to mark the release of her memoir, also said she was partly to blame for the debate on gender recognition laws in Scotland losing "all sense of rationality". Spindrift Isla Bryson jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape It led to a change in policy so that all newly-convicted or remanded transgender prisoners are initially placed in jails according to their birth sex. "I think what I would say now is that anybody who commits the most heinous male crime against women probably forfeits the right to be the gender of their choice." When pressed about that comment, she added it was "probably was not the best phrase to use". "I should have taken a step back and said, 'How do we achieve this?"' SNP MSP Michelle Thomson, who along with Conservative MSP Russell Findlay proposed an amendment to the gender recognition bill that would have halted gender recognition certificates being given to rapists, said Sturgeon's comments came "too late". "Had she stopped to consider or engage with concerns regarding women's existing rights she would not have forced the SNP group to vote against my amendment to temporarily pause the granting of GRCs to rapists. "For that reason I think that Nicola should really apologise for her failure to listen and act on the views of others." PA Media Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond fell out after the 2014 referendum Sturgeon's memoir, Frankly, will be published on Thursday. Findlay, now Scottish Tory leader, said: "Frankly, Nicola Sturgeon must be delusional if she thinks the women of Scotland will swallow this drivel." He added: "Her absurd ideological belief in self-ID collapses with her belated mealy-mouthed admission that this rapist is a man, but she still can't bring herself to say sorry for all the pain and misery she has caused." Sturgeon also reflected on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, when she campaigned for Yes while serving as deputy first minister to Alex Salmond. "I knew I was going to have to sit him down and say, 'look, you're going to have to read this, and you're going to have to tell me now if there are bits you want to change, because it has to be signed off'. Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offence charges in 2020, including attempted rape, but during the trial his lawyer admitted his client could "have been a better man." He died aged 69 in October. He said Salmond "had spent several years guiding SNP policy to form the basis of a credible case for independence on the back of having ran the most competent government in the history of Scotland". McEleny added: "Nicola's upset that Alex went on a trade mission and left her to complete a task she was responsible for sums up her lack of personal political accountability."

That is some of the reaction to news that two of the world's tech giants will pay the US government 15% of their revenue from selling certain advanced chips to China. But developing them was the only option for accessing the significant Chinese market after the previous administration of President Joe Biden banned US companies from exporting the most advanced chips to China because of national security concerns. More importantly, what message does it send to other US companies that see China as a key market or supplier - from Apple and Tesla to the small furniture and toymakers? Getty Images Artificial intelligence is expected to change the global economy The 15% cut that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to is likely to hurt their bottom line, even if they earn substantial profits from sales to China. A US official told Reuters that the White House did not believe the sale of H20 and equivalent chips would compromise national security - despite the fact they were previously banned on these grounds. National security experts and some lawmakers have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.

Article: LONDON — Europe is scrambling to stop itself and Ukraine from being frozen out of peace talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, fearing they could reshape the military and political future of the Continent without them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself recounted upward of 15 phone calls with world leaders and others this weekend, from France and Germany to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as news sunk in that there may be no one at the meeting from the country that has been occupied and bombed for more than three years. “We cannot accept” territorial questions being “discussed or even decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told his country’s state broadcaster ARD on Sunday. “I assume that the American government sees it the same way.” Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, Merz and other European leaders issued a joint statement Sunday saying that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Trump announced last week that he would join Putin in Alaska on Friday for their first face-to-face discussion of his second term, and the first with the Russian president by any G-7 leader since Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022. It is also demanding that Ukraine cede control of the eastern regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, not just the parts of those territories that Moscow currently occupies and that make up around 20% of Ukraine’s total territory.

Ricky Jones, 57, described far right protesters as "disgusting Nazi fascists" at a demonstration in Walthamstow on 7 August last year, according to a video of the event shown to jurors. Opening the case for the prosecution, Ben Holt said Mr Jones had received a flyer warning of a planned protest outside the immigration centre by activist Tommy Robinson, and his supporters. "During this speech Mr Jones referred to the other side, if you like, as disgusting Nazi fascists, and he said that their throats needed to be slit and as he said that he drew his finger along his throat. "This is, the prosecution say, in a setting where violence could readily have been anticipated." Mr Holt said Mr Jones was "rabble rousing" a crowd which has been described as "tens of thousands" in size. 'Razor blades' Mr Holt told the court at the time of the unity rally violent protests had already taken place in the UK, in response to the murder of three children in Southport. He said: "In August last year Mr Jones was a Labour councillor for Dartford and as a result, received, authored and at the very least co-signed documents about the state of flux the country was in at the time." The court was also told Mr Jones had been sent images of stickers on trains which advertised the far right "National Front".

Bruce responded that Johnson had simply shared “his opinion.” But when pressed further on whether Johnson’s comments reflected the opinion of the United States government, the State Department’s chief spokesperson replied, “Well, I’m not going to speak about opinion of the government.” The response raised a few eyebrows for reasons that should be obvious: talking to reporters about the country’s foreign policy views are a key part of Bruce’s job, whether she realizes this or not. But while Bruce’s briefings have bordered on satire in recent months, doing lasting harm to reputation and credibility, they appear — predictably — to have been well received in the West Wing. The New York Times reported: President Trump said on Saturday that he was nominating Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department, as the next deputy representative of the United States to the United Nations. Bruce had done a ‘fantastic job’ in her State Department role and that she would ‘represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations.’ Bruce parlayed a lengthy career on Fox News into a Trump administration position, which in turn led to a promotion of sorts. She will still need to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate (which seems like a safe bet); and if successful on Capitol Hill, she’ll likely work alongside Michael Waltz, whom Trump tapped to serve as U.S.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operations, said the Plandin plant produces gyroscopic devices, control systems and on-board computers for the missiles and is an “absolutely legitimate target” because it is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that works for the war against Ukraine.

Yvette Cooper has said that some supporters of Palestine Action "don't know the full nature" of the group, following the mass arrest of more than 500 people at the weekend. The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, and happened after followers caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton. "But it's really important that no-one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." Cooper added there had been "clear security assessments and advice" ahead of the ban. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified." Asked whether there was any reconsideration of the decision to proscribe Palestine Action, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was based on strong security advice. "Palestine action was proscribed based on strong security advice – following serious attacks the group has committed involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage," he said, adding: "Whilst many people may not yet know the reality of the organisation – those assessments are very clear." The spokesman said the police had carried out their duties "without fear or favour", which he said was "a foundational principle of policing by consent".

On Monday, Finland’s National Prosecution Authority said in a statement that the ship’s captain, as well as the first and second officers, had been charged with “aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications” in relation to the episode. The statement did not identify the three crew members, saying only that they had denied the accusations — which according to the authority appeared to involve dragging the ship’s anchor on the seabed for miles and severing five cables in the Gulf of Finland.

Article: A United States judge has denied a request by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to unseal transcripts from a grand jury that indicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned former girlfriend and associate of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a decision issued on Monday, Judge Paul A Engelmayer said lawyers for the government failed to convince the court that extraordinary circumstances warranted the release of the grand jury testimony, which is typically delivered privately and sealed. “[The government’s] entire premise – that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the Government’s investigation into them – is demonstrably false,” Engelmayer wrote in his decision. The DOJ in June announced it would not release any additional documents from the investigation into Epstein, causing an uproar among President Donald Trump’s base, which holds a number of conspiracy theories about the well-connected sex trafficker. In 2021, Maxwell was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein – a one-time friend to the powerful and influential in the US – and was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her crimes.

Article: LEWISVILLE, Texas — A family is suing a North Texas child care center, alleging negligence after they say their 2-year-old child slipped on a wet floor from water leaking in the facility and lost a tooth. In a lawsuit filed recently filed against The Learning Experience-Castle Hills in Lewisville, the family alleges the facility "failed to maintain the safety of their facility, resulting in [the child] slipping on water leaking into the facility during a rainstorm" on May 28, 2024. The lawsuit further alleges the staff at the facility was aware of the water leak, but no warning signs were posted, and staff didn't call 911 after the child's fall "despite the obvious severity of her injuries." "An investigation conducted by the state revealed that The Learning Experience was aware of the leaking water into the building–yet no guards were put up and no warning signs were posted. " The lawsuit alleges a staffer at the center told the child's parents in a call that the child was "just bleeding a little" but was given an ice pack and "doing fine." The lawsuit alleges the center was cited during the investigation by the state of Texas childcare licensing division for failing to clean, repair, and maintain the building, grounds, and equipment to protect the health of the children, and for failing to maintain competency and good judgment in the presence of children. "This was not an unavoidable accident but the direct result of The Learning Experience ignoring a known safety hazard and failing to act to protect the children in its care," said attorney Russell Button of The Button Law Firm, who represents the toddler and her parents. "A 2-year-old girl paid the price for that negligence, and we aim to hold The Learning Experience accountable, so this never happens to another child." The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $1,000,000, but the amount will be determined by a jury.

Article: Analysts estimate earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents on revenue of approximately $14.63 billion, reflecting 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth and about 16% year-on-year free cash flow growth to just under $4.1 billion. Bull case: The bullish outlook for Cisco centers on its positioning in high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and software-centric services, which are expected to drive sustained revenue expansion and margin improvement. The company's FY free cash flow estimate of $13.4 billion represents a free cash flow yield of about 4.7%, Bear case: Cisco's traditional networking hardware faces commoditization risks, and while AI orders are promising, the greater than $1 billion in AI orders the company highlighted in May represented between 2%-3% of the company’s total FY-to-date revenues of more than $40 billion. That's not only less than many AI technology companies, but actually well below the rate of earnings growth exhibited by the S & P 500 generally, although these two are closely related, admittedly due to the outsize effects of technology behemoths like Nvidia. One way to play a modestly bullish view in Cisco is by purchasing a longer-dated December 72.5 calls financed in part with the sale of a nearer-dated strangle, such as the September 67.5/80.

Article: Killing lingering cancer cells In the Phase 1 trial, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.) Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors. “Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.” Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. His team is currently running a randomized Phase 2 trial to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence. A growing field Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.” More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences.

Article: Donald Trump has spent the last few days vowing to unveil the details of a new “beautification” initiative regarding Washington, D.C., which the president has said would involve moving homeless people “FAR from the Capital” and reducing crime rates. “Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR.” As for how, exactly, he intends to do this, NBC News reported, “Trump announced this morning that he will federalize the Washington, D.C., police and deploy National Guard troops in an effort to fight crime.” As far as the White House is concerned, this is the first in a series of related steps. We’ll starting very strongly with D.C.” Crime rates in New York City, Baltimore and Oakland have already sharply improved, and while Trump has repeatedly insisted that crime in nation’s capital is “out of control,” in reality, crime in D.C. The president isn’t just deploying National Guard troops in yet another American city, in response to a crisis that doesn’t appear to exist, he’s also claiming emergency powers to federalize a local police department, despite the apparent lack of emergency conditions that might warrant such a move. The president even appears to be creating new criminal statutes on the fly, declaring at his press conference that those who “even think about destroying a statue or monument” in the city will “go to jail for 10 years.” Does he have the legal authority to make such declarations? 6 rioters, many of whom did far more than just spit on police officers during violent clashes at the Capitol, but who nevertheless received presidential pardons from the Republican just hours after his second inaugural.

Article: The Trump Justice Department lost its motion to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Ghislaine Maxwell’s case, with a federal judge on Monday calling the whole premise behind the government’s effort “demonstrably false.” That premise, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York recounted in a scathing opinion, was that the grand jury details would shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes or on the government's investigation into them. Engelmayer, an Obama appointee, noted that the Maxwell grand jury didn’t hear testimony from firsthand witnesses, victims or the like, but rather simply met “for the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.” He said the evidence presented to the Maxwell grand jury “is today, with only very minor exceptions, a matter of public record.” Rather than exposing new information, Engelmayer wrote, unsealing would expose the disingenuousness behind the government’s claim that unsealing would be revelatory. “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency’ but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” the judge wrote. “A member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand jury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to nothing new,” he wrote, adding that the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.” The judge’s ruling is unsurprising, as I previously wrote about the likely limited nature of what unsealing would reveal. It comes amid the administration’s attempt to handle political backlash from President Donald Trump’s supporters over its refusal to release all the information it has related to Epstein, who died in 2019 while being held on sex trafficking charges. After she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month, the government moved Maxwell to a minimum-security facility — an unusual move that has furthered speculation over what sort of additional favorable treatment she might receive. And still pending in New York is the government’s motion to unseal grand jury information in his case there, which the government has been litigating in tandem with the Maxwell unsealing effort. The judge overseeing Epstein’s New York case has not yet ruled, but given the apparently limited nature of the grand jury presentation in that case as well, he could rule in a similar fashion to Engelmayer.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington including deployment of the National Guard, prompting the city’s mayor to voice legal concerns about who would be patrolling the streets in the nation’s capital. Trump said at a Monday news briefing that he was “deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they’re going to be allowed to do their job properly.” The Republican president compared crime in the American capital with that in other major cities, saying Washington performs poorly on safety relative to the capitals of Iraq, Brazil and Colombia, among others. WATCH LIVE: Trump holds news briefing on plans for homelessness and crime in Washington For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials as well as the National Guard, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. Combating crime The president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday. More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. The National Guard Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is “the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump’s weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.” For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Crime statistics Police statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

On December 14, 2023, Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa was targeted by an Israeli air strike while reporting alongside Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, who was injured in the same attack. Abudaqa was left to bleed to death at the Farhana school in Khan Younis, where they were filming, as emergency workers were blocked by the Israeli military from reaching the site. On January 7, 2024, Wael’s eldest son and fellow Al Jazeera journalist, Hamza Dahdouh, was killed in a missile strike on the vehicle he was travelling in in Khan Younis. On July 31, 2024, Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi were killed in an Israeli attack on the Shati refugee camp despite their vehicle bearing clear media markings and both wearing vests identifying themselves as members of the news media. Advertisement ​​According to Brown University’s Costs of War project, more journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began on October 7, 2023, than in the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan – combined. Targeting journalists is a war crime Al Jazeera has condemned the targeted killing of its correspondents as “yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom”, noting that al-Sharif and his colleagues were among the last voices reporting from inside Gaza as international media remained barred by Israel. Amnesty International condemned the killings as a war crime and honoured al-Sharif as a “brave and extraordinary” reporter, noting he received the Human Rights Defender Award in 2024 for his commitment to press freedom.

What makes this statistic even more stark is that Gaza is losing voices on the ground at a time when Israel has banned international media from entering the besieged enclave. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said the killings of journalists and their detentions since October 7, 2023, have created a news void that will cause potential war crimes to go undocumented. Advertisement In June, the RSF, CPJ and news organisations published an open letter stating that many Palestinian journalists who have been relied on by reporters outside Gaza have faced a plethora of threats and many “face constant threats to their lives for doing their jobs: bearing witness”.

In a pre-US-Russia summit push aimed at consensus, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz invited Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting on Wednesday. “The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine,” leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain and Finland, and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement ahead of the call.

Article: Late Sunday evening, Israel’s military targeted Al Jazeera Arabic’s Gaza correspondents Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and three others, killing them in a drone strike against their media tent at the gate of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “If this madness doesn’t end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people’s voices silenced, their faces erased – and history will remember you as a silent witness to a genocide that you chose not to stop,” he posted. For most of their lives, Israel has imposed a full land, sea and air blockade over the enclave, effectively turning it into what human rights groups describe as an open-air prison. Advertisement The siege affected every aspect of Palestinian life – livelihoods, travel and family connections and compelled al-Sharif and Qreiqeh to dedicate their lives to telling the world about their people’s struggle under Israel’s brutal occupation. Al-Sharif studied media studies at Al-Aqsa University in Gaza and was known for his reporting on the Israeli military campaign that began on October 7, 2023, documenting its humanitarian and civilian impacts. Yaser al-Banna, a Palestinian journalist in Gaza, said that when Israel ordered the entire population of 2.2 million Palestinians to flee south – an act that likely amounts to a war crime – al-Sharif stayed in the north to document the events and actions of the Israeli military. At the time, al-Banna was in southern Gaza and Qreiqeh was in the north, and they often traded contacts and exchanged information to better cover the humanitarian impact of Israel’s genocidal war. “My impression of Qreiqeh was that he was always patient and calm.” Colleagues and friends In October 2024, Israel published unsubstantiated claims that al-Sharif was among six Palestinian journalists affiliated with a Hamas cell, which Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied. Carrying the torch Speaking from Al Jazeera’s studio in Doha, Qatar, their colleague Tamer Almisshal revealed that both al-Sharif and Qreiqeh were mentally and physically exhausted leading up to their deaths.

Trump also said at his news briefing that his administration has started removing homeless encampments “from all over our parks, our beautiful, beautiful parks.” “We're getting rid of the slums, too,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be taking over responsibility for Washington's metro police department, he said, while also complaining about potholes and graffiti in the city and calling them “embarrassing.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects a next step in his law enforcement agenda after his aggressive push to stop illegal border crossings. But the move involves at least 500 federal law enforcement officials as well as the National Guard, raising fundamental questions about how an increasingly emboldened federal government will interact with its state and local counterparts. Combating crime The president has used his social media and White House megaphones to message that his administration is tough on crime, yet his ability to shape policy might be limited outside of Washington, which has a unique status as a congressionally established federal district. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday. More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The National Guard Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. “I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend,” acknowledging it is "the president’s call about how to deploy the Guard.” Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World." For Bowser, “Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Focusing on homelessness Trump in a Sunday social media post had emphasized the removal of Washington’s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go. We’re going to put you in jail where you belong.” Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president criticized the district as full of “tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,” and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. He called Bowser “a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.” Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities.

Article: No plans to change passenger rules for new young drivers a 'major oversight', AA says 50 minutes ago Share Save Emily Atkinson BBC News Share Save Getty Images The government's planned overhaul of driving laws in Great Britain has a "major oversight" by not including stronger driving licence rules for new and young motorists, the AA has said. The AA welcomed the government's plans in the main, but said "the missing element is measures to safeguard and to save new driver and passenger lives by limiting peer-age passengers for six months". They also suggest that male drivers between the ages of 17 and 24 are more likely to be killed or seriously injured than any other age group, apart from those aged 86 or older. Road safety charity Brake said this was due to young drivers being more likely to take risks on the road or crash when they have passengers of their own age, something that does not happen as much for older drivers.

Article: NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell won’t be released, a judge decided Monday. READ MORE: Ghislaine Maxwell doesn’t want Epstein grand jury transcripts released “And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous,” he added. The judge noted the Justice Department had requested public disclosure of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury, minus redactions to protect privacy, even though the government had identified no information of consequence in the grand jury record that’s not already public. The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.” Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents, in an effort to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who died behind bars while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury’s closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell’s 2021 trial, in victims’ civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses. Epstein already had served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges at the time. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump’s Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn’t exist. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.

Article: TEL AVIV — Outrage is growing over Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned new Gaza Strip offensive, with news of the Israeli leader’s broadening military campaign met with anger at home and condemnation abroad. An association of Israel air force reserve and retired pilots have issued a statement calling for an “immediate end to the futile war and urgent action to bring the hostages home.” “The war being waged in Gaza is exacting an unbearable toll from hostages who have languished in captivity for 676 days, is risking our soldiers’ lives in vain, is causing unnecessary harm to innumerable innocent civilians, and is degrading Israel’s standing in the world to an unprecedented low,” it added on Sunday. The statement — which was the first time the group had explicitly called for an end to the conflict — was issued as Palestinians continued dying from both Israeli fire and hunger. “The decision to send the army deeper into Gaza is a danger to my husband, Omri,” Lishay Miran-Lavi, wife of hostage Omri Miran, told a news conference Sunday as Netanyahu defended a previously unannounced operation in the besieged and bombarded Palestinian enclave. “We want, first of all, to enable safe zones to be established so the civilian population of Gaza City can move out.” Israel’s goal was not to stay in Gaza — just free it of Hamas, Netanyahu added. “Expanding military operations will only endanger the lives of all civilians in Gaza, including the remaining hostages, and result in further unnecessary suffering,” Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia and Britain said in a joint statement. “This is a manmade crisis, and therefore urgent action is needed to halt starvation and to surge aid into Gaza.” Later Sunday, Al Jazeera said five of its staff members — Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa — were killed “in a targeted Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City.” The Israeli military said that al-Sharif was “the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organization and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.” Al-Sharif and the Qatar-owned broadcaster have previously denied accusations that he was a terrorist.

Article: UN condemns targeted Israeli attack that killed five Al Jazeera journalists Palestinians attend the funeral of journalists killed in an Israeli strike Media rights groups and countries including Qatar have condemned the attack. The funerals of Sharif, fellow Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa took place on Monday following the targeted missile strike on their tent in Gaza City. The only materials that have been released for publication are screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. CPJ says at least 186 journalists have been killed since the start of Israel's military offensive in Gaza in October 2023 - the deadliest period for journalists since it began recording such data in 1992. "We call for immediate, safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists." Last month, the BBC and three other news agencies - Reuters, AP and AFP - issued a joint statement expressing "desperate concern" for journalists in the Strip, who they say are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families. Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

Article: The announcement on Monday came after an urgent review launched last week after media reports said the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet engine group that provides services to Israel’s military, including the maintenance of fighter jets, as Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and the Palestinian population rages. The fund, an arm of Norway’s central bank and the world’s largest, held stakes in 61 Israeli companies as of June 30 but in recent days divested stakes in 11 of these, it said in a statement. The Norwegian government began its review after Aftenposten, the country’s leading newspaper, revealed that the fund had a stake in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL), which provides parts to Israeli fighter jets that are being deployed in the war on Gaza. Several of Europe’s biggest financial firms have cut back their links to Israeli companies or those with ties to the country, according to an analysis of filings by the Reuters news agency, as pressure mounts from activists and governments to end the war in Gaza. Last month, Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, called on countries to cut off all trade and financial ties with Israel, including a full arms embargo, and withdraw international support for what she termed an “economy of genocide”. In a report titled From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide, Albanese detailed “the corporate machinery sustaining Israel’s settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory”. The report singled out companies – including arms manufacturers, technology giants, heavy machinery companies and financial institutions – for their “complicity” in Israel’s repression of Palestinians from sustaining Israeli expansions onto occupied land to enabling the surveillance and killings of Palestinians.

Article: (This is The Best Stocks in the Market , brought to you by Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management.) Josh — I'll start with a chart that caught my eye showing two of the seven semiconductor companies on our Best Stocks in the Market list essentially being one big trade. There's very little daylight between how these stocks act day to day, week to week: President Donald Trump made it clear last week that the manufacturing of semiconductors on U.S. KLA Corp , a company formerly known as KLA Tencorp, has been shocking Wall Street with explosive earnings reports lately, including a 60% increase in EPS with a 30% jump in revenue in the latest quarter. Lam Research is a $130 billion company that specializes in areas of the chip manufacturing process like etch tools that precisely remove material layers from a wafer as well as wet and plasma-based cleaning equipment to remove contaminants. Both companies derive less than 10% of their revenue from North America, which means that Trump's new tariffs represent both a challenge and a substantial opportunity as the domestic demand picture shifts into overdrive. Top sector ranking: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sean — We have seven semiconductor companies on our list (inclusive of semi equipment firms too), which ranks fourth out of our industry exposure: That list includes: ADI , ALAB , AMD , AVGO , KLAC , LRCX and NVDA . Tariffs on imported chips and related technologies are viewed as a tool to protect and incentivize the U.S.-based production, ensuring a stable supply, safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI race. Equipment makers such as KLAC and LRCX benefit as domestic fabs expand capacity, while chip designers like AMD and NVDA gain from increased availability of homegrown manufacturing partners and potentially reduced reliance on overseas foundries.

Article: Milwaukee area drying out after weekend rain causes record flooding on multiple rivers No fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning from the storms that began Saturday night and stretched into Sunday. MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial state records of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. Tom Groppi told WISN-TV that the basement of his Milwaukee home never flooded in more than 50 years, but he had 3 feet (about 91 centimeters) of water in it this weekend. "We are not expecting the level that we saw over the weekend, but there could be some areas that get some heavy downpours," said Sarah Marquardt, a National Weather Service meteorologist at the Milwaukee/Sullivan office. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away in quickly moving water on a road flooded by the Root River in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee. The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon's Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee.

"This year's peak unfortunately lines up with a full Moon meaning even in dark sky areas it will be impossible to see the full 100 meteors per hour," said Mr Burridge. "However, [the Sturgeon Moon] is no reason not to go out and enjoy the shower - it is still likely that you will see at least 1 or 2 fireballs per hour, even with a full moon," he added. "After the full Moon is more likely the better time to view, since the Moon will rise later in the night, so I would recommend the peak nights as well as weekend of 16 and 17 August," he added. Most parts of the UK will sit under fairly cloudy skies though the first half of Monday night, although there will be glimpses of clearer skies too, especially for parts of Northern Ireland, north-west England and southern Scotland. After sunset, areas of cloud and scattered showers are likely to develop across parts of Northern Ireland and the far north-west of England for a time, before drifting into central and southern Scotland.

CDs offering free trial internet service were ubiquitous in mailboxes, and the service’s “You’ve got mail” chime and chatrooms were so famous they inspired a 1998 film about online romance starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But children of the ’90s sat through excruciatingly long waits — and a series of electronic whistles, beeps and static as their modems connected — to download photos of rock singer Courtney Love playing her Fender Squier Venus guitar or Bush front man Gavin Rossdale shirtless. In maybe the most mid-’90s story, The Post wrote in May 1994 about AOL users on the Alternative Rock forum sharing bereavements and poems about the death of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, Love’s husband. (Now, with broadband internet service, computers simply remain connected to the ISP and work at 400 times the speed of dial-up.) For many users, a lasting memory of starting an AOL session are the unforgettable, jolting beeps as the modem connected. Dial-up cratered and the junk mail CDs that AOL sent out to entice people with free hours of internet access became little more than Frisbees for children to fling at each other. In 2015, about 2.1 million people were still using AOL’s dial-up, according to CNBC, adding a quote from an unnamed source that it was “in the low thousands” in May 2021.

The style of both videos — their goofy, very-online mix of accusations and insinuations, their readiness to just say stuff — reminded me of nothing so much as Donald Trump himself. Across that decade, the usual strategy for Trump’s critics, Republicans and Democrats alike, has been to adopt a contrasting seriousness: They have tried to present as the high-minded adults in the room, the ones who aren’t constantly slinging insults, posting nasty cartoon memes and stoking fringe theories.

Article: That's because this week's inflation data is the last before Federal Reserve policymakers convene next week for their annual summer consortium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, an event that will likely shape expectations for their September meeting. "We are Tactically Bullish as we see this week's macro data (Retail Sales, CPI, PPI, Jobless Claims) remaining supportive of [the] bull case, with earnings likely to maintain their positive trend," read a note from the trading desk at JPMorgan. "If the inflation increases are more gradual, then the market is likely to remain unbothered unless/until we get to a level that would make a rate hike a credible threat." To be sure, the team added, the key risk is that CPI will come out stronger. Nevertheless, the JPMorgan trading desk expects that a more threatening level in core, year-over-year inflation would mean a rate of 4.0%, rather than the 3.0% some economists are expecting from the next core CPI report. In this case, easier inflation might drive the S & P 500 to a gain of 0.75% to 1.2% Just a 5% chance that core month-over-month CPI drops to less than 0.25%.

Article: Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts. "You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump. If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, "This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy." "This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote. "If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote. The governor added that if the other states "call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same." Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps. That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

Anas is now gone, and I feel I was wrong to hope, wrong to believe in the justice of this world, watching him appeal – with eyes overflowing with tears – to a global conscience that proved to be low and selective. I wished the war had ended before you were martyred so I could go find you in Gaza and tell you that our voices had succeeded, they had reached to the outside world and driven change. For me, that means speaking, writing, and exposing the crimes of this bloody and brutal occupation … until the day you dreamed of, Anas – the day this genocide, the most horrific in modern history, ends.

The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Just last week, Kennedy terminated 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines — the same technology used to develop Pfizer’s and Moderna’s Covid shots. In an announcement on X, Kennedy claimed “mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for these respiratory viruses.” In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said Kennedy ”has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce,” Nixon said, “not a moment for the media to exploit a tragedy for political gain.” Kennedy has not yet spoken publicly about vaccine misinformation that may have contributed to the shooting. “There’s a lot of misinformation, a lot of really dangerous rhetoric that’s currently being spread by the current administration, that makes us seem like villains, that makes us seem like our work is setting out to hurt people,” CDC employee Elizabeth Soda said in an interview. “People feel like this is a natural progression when you spend years denigrating science and public health, spread misinformation about vaccines and publicly attack federal workers,” said one CDC employees who was granted anonymity for fear of repercussions. An employee at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said it’s not lost on them that Kennedy “has demonized our work.” In an email obtained by NBC News, Kennedy told CDC staff on Saturday that he was praying for the entire agency, adding that the shooting was “deeply unsettling,” especially for those working in Atlanta.

Article: GENEVA (AP) — As nations began a second week of negotiations Monday for a global accord to end plastic pollution, an artist heaped piles of plastic waste onto a large sculpture in front of the United Nations office. WATCH: New study highlights ‘grave, growing’ danger of plastic pollution to world’s health Benjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, designed the nearly 6 meter (18 foot) sculpture called the “Thinker’s Burden” and built it with a team. Standing by the sculpture, Maria Ivanova, an expert in international environmental governance, said it “wakes you up.” Ivanova is the co-director of the Plastics Center at Northeastern University in Boston. “And this is where I think art is absolutely critical to shift the needle on policy.” Delegates and tourists stopped to ask Von Wong about his work and pose for photos in front of it. Michael Bonser, head of the Canadian delegation, called the artwork “extraordinarily profound.” “It gives us a sense, every day, of what we need to be doing inside the room, what we need to walk out with.

Article: The battle over potential mid-decade redistricting in Texas -- where the state's congressional district lines could be redrawn well ahead of the upcoming census -- continued Monday as dozens of Texas House Democrats remained out of state for a second week to block any potential votes on the map. In Austin, the Texas House of Representatives is scheduled to meet and the redistricting bill is technically scheduled for a second reading (which would not be a vote to pass it out of the chamber). The Texas Senate is also scheduled to meet and may vote on its own version of redistricting legislation, although if it votes the bill out of the Senate it cannot be voted on in the House until there is a quorum. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Abbott has also said he will call special legislative session after special session to get the Republican-supported maps passed, even if Democrats run out the 30-day clock on the current session.

Article: Her partner, Art Linfoot, built the house they lost, a cabin with a wraparound porch and a year-round brook where deer drank and the sound of the water lulled the couple to sleep. But the fire that came through their Butte County home didn’t care about her trimmed trees, or her hard work or our persistent belief that everything will somehow be OK after a disaster. “I know how long it takes for a tree to grow, and I just knew this would never, never work out for us.” Hers is a bit of wisdom that is too often lost in our conversations about urban fire: Sometimes, recovery is not rebuilding. We need to change our understanding of what recovery is, because we live in an era when the climate crisis has created not just survivors, but refugees and migrants in California and the United States — and they deserve more than a slogan that, to steal a favorite phrase from our governor, does not “meet the moment.” As we hurl forward to rebuild after January’s fires in the Palisades and Altadena — and all the disasters yet to come — it’s time to acknowledge that recovery and rebuilding, for all our talk, is never fair. And for every recovery that we allow to be unfair under the guise of #strong, we march deeper to a California where the elite live in comfort and the rest live in fear — a rightful anxiety that everything we have is tenuous, given and taken as afterthoughts in a tug-of-war between Mother Nature and the wealthy. In his infamous 1998 essay, “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” the much-revered and equally despised environmental activist and historian Mike Davis wrote that the “flatland majority” has always been paying “the ever increasing expense of maintaining and, when necessary, rebuilding sloping suburbia,” those rarefied neighborhoods that consider themselves part of Los Angeles proper only when they need something from the rest of us. A 75-year history of fires in the Santa Monica Mountains Simi Valley Camarillo Woolsey (2017) Thousand Oaks Calabasas Palisades (2025) Malibu 5 MILES 1950-1959 1960-1969 1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2019 2020-2025 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Sean Greene LOS ANGELES TIMES Advertisement When Davis wrote his controversial piece, he also noted that “late August to early October is the infernal season in Los Angeles.” More than three decades later, climate change has intensified our weather so much that floods and fires haunt almost every month of the California calendar, eclipsing the chthonic terrors of earthquakes that rattle us only now and then. Summer Gray, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies the inequities in our responses to climate change, says disaster recovery can be “highly performative, often driven by more privileged members of the community” who have the money and clout that allow them to suck up resources. Though talk in the ultra-wealthy enclave was all about community recovery, Gray concluded — through interviewing community members — that those with the ability to speak loudest and earliest often received more help, and set the agenda for what recovery included, and didn’t. Gray warns that sometimes, whether consciously or not, these privileged groups leverage “the optics of this collective recovery to accelerate their own rebuilding,” leaving working-class survivors “sidelined or ignored.” Gray calls this attitude part of “conspicuous resilience,” conflating being temporarily displaced and inconvenienced with being oppressed and vulnerable, leading to the celebration and glorification of a recovery that mostly benefits the few. But the elite, “don’t really understand what the needs are.” My colleague Liam Dillon reported not long ago that before the fire, “the average home in Pacific Palisades cost $3.5 million, the median household earned $325,000 and the total number of rental units restricted as affordable housing was two.” Advertisement Two. When Dillon asked former mayoral candidate and developer Rick Caruso, whose super-high-end mall is an anchor of Palisades commerce, if that should be expanded at this unique moment when everything must be rebuilt anyway, Caruso told him, “Now is not the time for outside groups with no ties to the area to slow down the ability of people to rebuild their homes by trying to impose their agenda.” Two people ride past a burning house off Enchanted Way in the Marquez Knolls neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in January. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been gutted, and may hand off many of its former duties to states, including California, that even if prosperous, lack the money to cover those costs. Advertisement Add to that the financial precariousness of tariffs that are making building more expensive, immigration policies that are decimating our construction workforce and insurance costs that are skyrocketing, if you can get a policy, and the prospect of the poor and middle class recovering from fire as quickly as the rich seems naive at best. Fixes for the future There are three actions we can take that have the potential to keep California from further devolving into climate rich and poor, housing winner and housing loser. Johnson views a focus on speed as “an empowerment of those who have everything they need, or who can easily get it.” Volunteer archaeologists Elyse Mallonee, left, and Parker Sheriff carefully sift through rubble and ash while looking for cremated remains at a house in Altadena on Feb. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Why don’t we acknowledge that fire destroys more than owner-occupied houses and give equal weight to graduation rates for affected students or the number of renters successfully relocated to safe apartments? The second action that will help us reform how we handle disaster is even more difficult: Openly talk about who gets to recover with public money (which repaves roads and fixes water systems and sewers, for example) and who gets to decide who recovers with public money. And in the middle of both hurricane and fire season, FEMA recently proposed cutting $1 billion in grant funding for disaster preparedness and security, while at the same time allocating funds to build immigration detention centers. Advertisement It is absolutely time to impose a recovery “agenda” that takes into account the realities of climate change and our housing crisis and seeks to create communities that are safe and in service of our collective needs. This program gave financial assistance of up to $350,000 per household through a forgivable second mortgage loan to low- and middle-income folks, mainly renters, displaced by past fires — basically helping to buy houses for economically-challenged survivors. Birdwell, who lost her home in Berry Creek, still thinks of that cabin as a “slice of heaven” and reminiscences “about how life used to be.” But she is left with anxiety — a remnant of the fire for which no one has offered her help — and a sense of dislocation and discontent. “That might be something that will happen the rest of my life.” Her fire was five years ago, but like so many, her recovery is as incomplete as it is ignored. In the next 30 years, we will assuredly have more climate refugees, more climate migrants, like Birdwell and Linfoot and the thousands of Angelenos still reeling from our recent fires. Advertisement If we don’t, we will simply move further into a future that bends recovery to benefit the wealthy, as Davis predicted long ago — prioritizing the rebuilding of hazardous communities again and again until the only people who can afford to live in them are the people who can afford to watch them burn.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Just before HISD opens its doors to a new school year, the athletic department honored some of HISD's best and brightest athletes and coaches at the 2025 Hall of Honor ceremony at Delmar Fieldhouse. "It is a way we can honor former athletes and coaches, and it can also let current and future students know that these individuals walked the same halls as they walk at the same schools," HISD Athletic Director Andre Walker Sr. "I feel blessed and happy to be here." Russel Charles, a Hall inductee who went to Kashmere then UCLA before starting a college coaching career, which included coaching under legendary Bill Walsh at Stanford. "To be in the same class as him, it means a whole hell of a lot." A preview of HISD's athletic Hall of Ceremony at Delmar Fieldhouse Three from Jack Yates were inducted. Running back from the 1985 state championship football team, Johnny Bailey, Donna Roper of the '83 girls state basketball championship team, and George Walker Senior, who went to Yates in the 1970s.

Also going into the Hall, Bellaire softball's Gabby Smith, three-sport athlete David Hoot from Reagan, and former Philadelphia Eagles and Booker T Washington's Leonard Mitchell. "I would hang in the back of the court and put it up the line, and I had a great lob." The final group recognized was the 1968-1970 Wheatly Wildcats, who are thought by many to have been the best collection of talent and coaching ever in the Houston area.

Article: government will take 15% of the revenue that chipmaker Nvidia pulls in from sales in China of its H20 microchip, which is used in the development of artificial intelligence, President Trump said on Monday. At a news conference at the White House, Trump said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked for restrictions on exports to be eased so that Nvidia could sell H20s into the Chinese market. Trump called the H20 "obsolete," and "an old chip that China already has … in a different form, different name." Nvidia designed the H20 to be less powerful than the company's top-of-the-line microchips to comply with export controls. Trump suggested that Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which he called "super duper advanced," might also be in play, but in a diminished form — and that he'd want a 30-to-50% cut of those sales.

Article: California is asking Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.” The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force. On Monday, Trump said he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city’s police department in the hopes of reducing crime, even as the mayor has noted that crime is falling in the nation’s capital. WATCH: Trump says he’s placing Washington police under federal control and deploying National Guard In June, the Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. The Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions and secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds. After their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. The Trump administration argued the troops were needed to protect federal buildings and personnel in Los Angeles, which has been a key location in the federal government’s aggressive immigration strategy. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.’” “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling ordering the three-day bench trial.

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him. The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that AMD, the second-place AI chip maker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

"And nothing that the Israeli forces has produced so far in terms of evidence gives us any kind of assurance that he was even an active member of Hamas." The 'only voice' left in Gaza City AFP via Getty Images Anas al-Sharif was one of the few voices left reporting in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera Anas al-Sharif became one of Al Jazeera's most prominent reporters in Gaza during the war. "He worked for the whole length of the war inside Gaza reporting daily on the situation of people and the attacks which are committed in Gaza," Salah Negm, director of news at Al Jazeera English, told the BBC. Married with a four-year-old daughter, Sham, and a one-year-old son, Salah, he was separated from them for long stretches during the war while he continued to report from the north of the territory after refusing to follow Israeli evacuation orders. He reported on the targeting of his colleagues, including prominent Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in 2024 in an air strike in Gaza City. Raed Fakih, input manager at Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel, told the BBC Sharif was "courageous, dedicated, and honest - that's what made him successful as a journalist with hundreds of thousands of social media followers from all over the world". And even in the face of death, he persisted, because this is a story that must be told." Mohammed Qreieh, 33, was a father of two from Gaza City, the Associated Press news agency reported. Israel alleges Sharif led 'terrorist cell', with little evidence The Israeli military accused Sharif of posing as a journalist, saying he had "served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas" and was responsible for launching rocket attacks at Israelis - but it has produced little evidence to support these claims. In a statement, the IDF said it had documents which "unequivocally prove" his "military affiliation" with Hamas, including "personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents". It has publicly released some screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. He described this as a "longstanding pattern" and referred to the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.

A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.” Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan Netanyahu’s office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.” Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel’s military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven’t been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel’s military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Article: An Israeli airstrike that deliberately killed an Al Jazeera reporter, as well as several of his colleagues, has aggravated tensions between Israel and Qatar, which funds the television network and is also a central mediator in talks to end the war in Gaza. The Israeli attack on Sunday, near a hospital in Gaza City, killed five Al Jazeera journalists, the network reported: the correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh; the photographers Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa; and an assistant, Mohammed Noufal. al-Sharif of being a Hamas fighter — an allegation that he and the network had rejected — and pointedly identified Al Jazeera as “Qatari.” The government of Qatar responded with a strong condemnation. “The deliberate targeting of journalists by Israel in the Gaza Strip reveals how these crimes are beyond imagination,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar, said on Monday, in criticizing the international community’s inability “to stop this tragedy.”

Article: ET Campbell RobertsonKatie Rogers and President Trump significantly escalated his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital on Monday, saying that he was temporarily taking control of the city’s police department and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime there. At a White House news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington — including “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth” — that stood in sharp contrast to official figures showing violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days. Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of D.C., called them “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,” and said his office “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.” Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize. Familiar targets: In decrying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Article: The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will need to drastically cut rations to refugees in Kenya due to reductions in global aid, including major funding cuts from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Residents of the Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps were beginning to feel the impact of food aid cuts on Monday as the WFP implemented a new assistance system there in which certain groups are prioritised over others. The WFP said aid is being cut by 60 percent for the most vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and disabled people, and by 80 percent for refugees with some kind of income. This will have a serious impact on vulnerable refugees, increasing the risk of hunger and malnutrition.” “There has been a lot of tension in the last couple of weeks or so,” Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi said, reporting from Kakuma. “People were very angry about what WFP is calling the priority food distribution, where some people will not get food at all and others are going to get a small fraction of the food.” These tensions boiled over, triggering protests last week, which left one person dead and several others injured, said Soi, adding that WFP officials she spoke with said the aid cuts from organisations like USAID meant they have had to make “very difficult decisions about who gets to eat and who doesn’t”. “We need to look at them separately and differently and see how best we can channel the system so that it provides.” The impact of these cuts is severe amid concerns over malnutrition. “Already the food that is being issued is quite low, 40 percent of the recommended ration, and this is being shared by a bigger chunk of the population,” Chica said, adding that stocks will therefore not last as long as hoped.

Article: US will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under a new, unusual agreement Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the "obsolete" H20 chip to China. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it "a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security." Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue." Derek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia's chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets.

Article: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters, shooting dozens of rounds into the sprawling complex and killing a police officer, had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Saturday. The 30-year-old shooter also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta but was stopped by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire late Friday afternoon, the official said. Kennedy Jr., a leading anti-science voice and longtime opponent of vaccines, “shares responsibility for the violence and should resign.” Similarly, MSNBC reported that the violence has left officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency understandably shaken, and “many are now demanding answers” from Kennedy, who “has long vilified the CDC and contributed to a culture of misinformation that they say makes them targets.” (The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment.) Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University, summarized the deadly violence this way in an opinion piece for The New York Times: “The attack left both himself and a law enforcement officer dead, and C.D.C. union has asked federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, since it is putting lives at risk.” It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump, as of this writing, has not commented on the CDC shooting at all, despite the president maintaining an active publishing schedule on his social media platform in recent days. Jerome Adams told CBS’ Margaret Brennan on ‘Face the Nation.’ During his on-air appearance, Adams, who served with Trump during the president’s first term, characterized Kennedy’s response to the deadly shooting as “tepid,” and emphasized how long it took for RFK Jr. “It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings, and that’s not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams added. Instead, the beleaguered HHS secretary posted condolences “more than 30 minutes after posting photos of himself fishing on social media.” Time will tell whether the deadly shooting causes RFK Jr.

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so. His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a “humanitarian catastrophe.” Australia’s government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza. Albanese says conditions must be met for Palestine recognition Albanese told reporters after a Cabinet meeting Monday that Australia’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. READ MORE: France will recognize Palestine as a state, President Macron says “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” Albanese said. “The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.” Netanyahu rebuked Australia before the announcement Ahead of Albanese’s announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state. The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. “This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way that isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all,” Albanese said. A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state. In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government “will carefully weigh up its position” on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September. “This commitment removes any incentive or diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always stood in the way of ending the conflict,” spokesperson for the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said in a statement. He told reporters in Melbourne on Monday that the move would do nothing to end the “ongoing genocide in Gaza which has been live streamed for the entire world for two years.”

Article: BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — An Islamic court in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province on Monday sentenced two men to public caning, 80 times each, after Islamic religious police caught them engaged in what the court deemed were sexual acts: hugging and kissing. The two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested in April after residents saw them entering the same bathroom at Taman Sari city park and reported it to police patrolling the area. Prosecutors previously sought 85 strokes of the cane for each, but the three-judge panel decided on what they described as lenient punishment because the men were outstanding students who were polite in court, cooperated with authorities and had no previous convictions. In February, the same court sentenced two men to public caning up to 85 times for gay sex after neighborhood vigilantes in Banda Aceh suspected them of being gay and broke into their rented room to catch them naked and hugging each other.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president will pardon jailed former justice minister and liberal ally Cho Kuk this week, officials said Monday, cutting short his two-year sentence for falsifying academic records to help his children enter prestigious schools. But it could also prove to be a divisive move for liberal President Lee Jae Myung, as the scandal surrounding Cho had struck a deep nerve in a country notorious for its educational zeal and fiercely competitive school environment. Lee, who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, said pardoning Cho and some other convicted politicians and public officials, including some conservatives, would help promote political unity. But the conservative People Power Party criticized the pardon, accusing Lee of arrogance and abusing his presidential powers to release and reinstate Cho, who “trampled on the fairness and common sense of future generations.” READ MORE: South Korean investigators seek arrest of ex-President Yoon’s wife The party was also critical of Lee’s decision to pardon former liberal lawmaker Yoon Meehyang, who was convicted of embezzling funds while leading a group supporting Korean survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery. Cho will be among 2,188 people — including convicted politicians, business leaders, and former officials — receiving pardons on Friday’s Liberation Day, which marks the Korean Peninsula’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II. Cho, who launched the minor Rebuilding Korea Party before last April’s legislative elections, had been serving a two-year prison term since December after the Supreme Court upheld various charges, including abuse of power and forging documents to help his children enter elite schools. The controversy, which erupted in 2019 and forced Cho to resign as justice minister, fueled public anger in a country grappling with widening inequality and an intensely competitive education system, and hurt the popularity of then-liberal President Moon Jae-in. Cho’s party supported Lee’s candidacy during the June presidential election, which was set up after Yoon was formally removed from office in April over his short-lived martial law imposition in December.

Article: Congressman Abraham Hamadeh made a brief visit to Syria where he discussed with the country’s interim president the return of the body of an American aid worker who was taken hostage and later confirmed dead in the war-torn country, his office said Monday. Hamadeh’s visit to Syria comes as a search has been underway in remote parts of the country for the remains of people who were killed by the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Syria and Iraq before its territorial defeat six years ago. The statement added that Hamadeh also discussed the need to establish a secure humanitarian corridor for the safe delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to the southern province of Sweida that recently witnessed deadly clashes between pro-government fighters and gunmen from the country’s Druze minority. The militant group lost most of its territory in Iraq in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019 when it lost the last sliver of land it controlled in east Syria. Mueller, from Prescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, where he had been hired to fix the internet service for the hospital.

Article: Drivers warned about scam car finance payout calls But the judgement left the possibility open for other motorists to claim, including those who had been charged overly large commission fees. The warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) comes after the watchdog announced it would set up a compensation scheme for motorists who were sold car finance deals that were unlawful. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the FCA announced it would start consulting on setting up a compensation scheme for eligible motorists, and it expects most eligible people to get less than £950. "We're aware of scammers calling people and posing as car finance lenders, offering fake compensation and asking for personal details," said Nisha Arora, director of special projects at the FCA. If anyone receives a call like this, hang up immediately and do not share any information." The FCA said it would never ask people for bank account PINs or passwords, and it has urged people to report any scam calls or texts to Ofcom. In a joint statement with the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the FCA pointed out that motorists could sacrifice up to 30% of any claims award in fees to the CMC or law firm. The point of a centralised redress scheme would be to make it easy for consumers to get compensation, without the need for help from a CMC or law firm, the FCA said. The final bill for the redress scheme could be as much as £18bn, with the watchdog estimating millions of people who bought new or used cars potentially dating back as far as 2007 could be eligible to make claims.

Article: They have got one of, if not the best, midfields in the country, they are really strong in wide areas and it looks like they are signing another centre-half in AC Milan's Malick Thiaw. They have seen Trent Alexander-Arnold leave, and tragically lost Diogo Jota, but have spent heavily to strengthen their squad and won't be distracted by having any stars coming to the end of their contract. How Gyokeres fits in is one of the things I am really looking forward to finding out in the new campaign, and it is the same with other strikers at new clubs, like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro at Chelsea. I was disappointed that he chose to go there over Newcastle, but at the same time I saw him live several times last season and he is a player with potential, rather than offering guaranteed goals. With Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United have spent more than £200m on their forward line, but I still don't see them getting in next season's top four.

Article: A group of Democratic lawmakers is pressing Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink for details on the Trump administration’s plan to pull funds from an Air Force nuclear modernization program to retrofit a luxury jet the president was given by the Qatari government. Jamie Raskin (Maryland) and John Garamendi (California) want answers on the plan to pay for this presidential vanity project with up to $934 million from the wildly over-budgeted “Sentinel” program, which is meant to upgrade the military’s nuclear arsenal. But rather than slash the program (like, say, funding for cutting-edge mRNA research and other things the administration has deemed wasteful), the administration plans to pull $400 million from it to retrofit Trump’s palatial new airplane, Meink said last month at a Senate subcommittee hearing. As one might imagine, the aforementioned Democrats are raising issues in a letter addressed to Meink last Wednesday: We write with concerns about how the Air Force is managing nuclear modernization funds, including whether those funds are being raided to retrofit a personal gift to President Trump that likely violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Deb Fischer of Nebraska have previously raised concerns about the program being used as a slush fund for the executive branch’s pet projects, the lawmakers make the seemingly obvious point that souping up a jet for the use of the sitting president, who intends to pass it along to his official library at the end of his term, meets that description: Now, our concerns, and those of other members, appear to be prescient as part of the Sentinel program’s bloated budget is being redirected to an unintended purpose: retrofitting the Qatari luxury jet to serve as Air Force One — and subsequently, after he has left office, as the Trump library’s private plane. They go on: It appears that funds for programs that the Air Force has continually claimed are among its top national security priorities are now being used as accounts for presidential whims, while the egregious lack of transparency hides the true costs of these programs from taxpayers. On Friday, liberal activists from the watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund joined the pressure campaign, urging the Defense Department’s inspector general to open a probe into whether the administration has broken any laws by accepting the jet (technically given to the Department of Defense).

Article: And in fact, he segued in his second term from being strictly confrontational with the Soviet Union, as he was in his first term, to actually forging a friendship with Gorbachev and reducing tensions and setting the stage for the end of the Cold War. BOOT: Well, I think, you know, the prime mover in many ways were, of course, the people of Eastern Europe, the people of Eastern Germany who didn't want to live under a communist dictatorship. And I think Gorbachev also deserves a lot of credit because he did not react in the way that the rulers of China did during the Tiananmen Square protests that same year. So this is a very complicated strategic calculus that the president has to deal with, and I'm not sure that President Trump is aware enough of the nuances or the consequences of his actions. INSKEEP: For that very reason, I wonder which of the president's actions we can see as changing the world and which we can see as getting attention, so to speak. And clearly, in the years since, he has become the preeminent figure in the Republican Party and taken the Republican Party in many ways in very different directions from those espoused by President Reagan. INSKEEP: In the current president's constant changes of attitude and position toward other world leaders, toward various wars and other situations, do you see any possibility of something like you described with Reagan where he confronted the Soviet Union and then got to another phase, and things got better? And so remember during his first term where he went from threatening to rain fire and fury on North Korea to talking about how much he loved Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. But right now, it's very hard to figure out what his method is actually gaining us because, you know, all that zigzagging is, I think, very confusing not just to Americans, but also to other world leaders.

Article: The president’s move also spurred Democratic governors, including Newsom, to pledge retaliatory redistricting efforts in their states — setting up the possibility of an extended standoff that could upend the 2026 midterm elections. Lawler calls for redistricting battles to end Newsom urged Trump in a letter Monday to abandon his scheme, telling the president he is “playing with fire” and “risking the destabilization of our democracy.” Newsom said he prefers that independent bodies draw political districts rather than partisan legislatures, as is done in Texas and most GOP-controlled states. But, he wrote, “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” If Texas and “the other states call off their redistricting efforts,” the governor added, “we will happily do the same. And American democracy will be better for it.” Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying in Illinois, New York and elsewhere, and they say they have no intentions of returning as long as Republicans are intent on mollifying Trump. “If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,” Abbott said over the weekend on “Fox News Sunday.” At the least, Texas lawmakers face $500 daily fines for each absence under legislative rules. She compared both the proposed Texas maps, which would disproportionately affect districts represented by Black and Latino Democrats, and Abbott’s and Paxton’s threats to the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. “Their fight is our fight, and just like the Civil Rights heroes of the past, no matter the cost we are prepared to see it through to the end,” Bowers said.

Article: The U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is happening at a site where East meets West — quite literally — in a place familiar to both countries as a Cold War front line of missile defense, radar outposts and intelligence gathering. But the Kremlin has long pushed back against Putin meeting Zelenskyy -– at least until a peace deal is reached by Russia and Ukraine and was ready to be signed. Putin said last week he wasn’t against meeting Zelenskyy “but certain conditions need to be created” for it to happen and were “still a long way off.” That raised fears about excluding Ukraine from negotiations. READ MORE: Ukrainian drone strike kills 1 in Russia as fighting rages ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit After the USSR’s collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don’t play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.” Sam Greene of King’s College London said on X the symbolism of Alaska as the site of a summit about Ukraine was “horrendous — as though designed to demonstrate that borders can change, land can be bought and sold.” What’s the agenda? Moscow presented ceasefire conditions that are nonstarters for Zelenskyy, such as withdrawing troops from the four regions Russia illegally annexed in 2022, halting mobilization efforts, or freezing Western arms deliveries. For a broader peace, Putin demands Kyiv cede the annexed regions, even though Russia doesn’t fully control them, and Crimea, renounce a bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language along with Ukrainian. Putin has warned Ukraine it will face tougher conditions for peace as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a “buffer zone.” Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for territory still under Ukrainian control in the four annexed regions annexed by Moscow. Putin sees a meeting with Trump as a chance to cement Russia’s territorial gains, keep Ukraine out of NATO and prevent it from hosting any Western troops so Moscow can gradually pull the country back into its orbit. He believes time is on his side as Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances along the front line amid swarms of Moscow’s missiles and drones battering the country. “A sustainable peace also means that aggression cannot be rewarded.” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday he believed Trump was “making sure that Putin is serious, and if he is not, then it will stop there.” “If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue. Since last week, Putin spoke to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as well as the leaders of South Africa, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, the Kremlin said.

Article: What to know about DC Home Rule Act as Trump puts DC police under federal control President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Section 740 of the Home Rule Act gives the president the ability to use D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department for "federal purposes" that the president "may deem necessary and appropriate." On Monday, Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of D.C.'s police force. On Capitol Hill, many Democrats have said the moves are a power grab by the president and a distraction from other matters, such as Trump's involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein files. Chris Murphy said in a post on X that "Trump's decision to take over the DC police isn't about public safety" and is "another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent." In a post on X, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith wrote, "WHAT THE HECK IS IN THOSE FILES?!" -- a reference to the Epstein files -- accompanied by a video of Trump in the briefing room for his announcement.

Article: “In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.” The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday. The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said. Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel plans to widen its coming offensive beyond Gaza City to the last areas not yet under Israeli control, and where most of Gaza’s 2 million residents have sought shelter as the territory slides toward famine. The mobilization of forces is expected to take weeks, and Israel may be using the threat of a wider offensive to try to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages or surrendering after 22 months of war sparked by its Oct. Any expansion of Israeli operations is likely to bring even more death and destruction to the war-ravaged territory, around 75% of which is already largely destroyed and controlled by Israel. Netanyahu says Israel will go into the central camps Israel announced last week its plans to take over Gaza City, where it has already carried out major raids and heavy bombardment throughout the war. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss aspects of the plans that have not been made public, said the operation will not begin immediately and will take a significant amount of time to scale up. Few places left to flee Netanyahu said Israel will allow civilians to flee to “designated safe zones,” where “they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.” He did not say where they would go. Last month, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly floated the idea of transferring Gaza’s population to a so-called “humanitarian city” that the military would build on the ruins of the southernmost city of Rafah — now a largely uninhabited Israeli military zone — on the border with Egypt. READ MORE: Israel targets and kills Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif in Gaza airstrike as journalist toll grows A possible negotiating tactic Netanyahu has said he will end the war if Hamas gives up power, lays down its arms and releases the remaining 50 hostages — around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group says it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not give up its weapons as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. But the hostages are Hamas’ only remaining bargaining chip, and it is unlikely to give them up if it believes that Israel will then resume the war, attempt to eradicate the group and carry out plans to depopulate Gaza.

Article: Compared to recent weeks, earnings won't be as much of a catalyst for the markets with only a small handful of stocks in the S & P 500 scheduled to report. Nvidia deal : The market doesn't mind that Club name Nvidia and peer AMD will have to give the United States a 15% share of all AI chip sales to China. The arrangement, confirmed by President Donald Trump on Monday, is part of a broader deal announced last month that restored the companies' ability to sell AI chips to Chinese customers. That ability had been revoked in April, when the Trump administration tightened Biden-era export controls that had forced Nvidia and AMD to design throttled-back versions of their top-end AI chips for the Chinese market. The bigger prize is maintaining the ability to sell to China, a market that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated could be worth $50 billion in the next few years. "From Nvidia's standpoint and from AMD's standpoint, I get it, like 85 cents is better than anything, and it's important for them to be able to sell into China because otherwise you're just handing that market over to China and to the local players. We need to be able to compete there, so that's good," Rasgon said on "The Exchange." He added, "I think that should happen on their own merits." To size up the potential impact of this payment, Nvidia was selling about $8 billion worth of chips to China a quarter prior to the previous export restriction. That's a large number for most companies, but not for Nvidia: analysts estimate the company will do about $200 billion in revenue over its ongoing fiscal year 2026 and $255 billion in fiscal year 2027.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the grinding multi-year war between Ukraine and Russia. Trump said he’s going to see what Putin “has in mind” to end the war and, if it’s a “fair deal,” he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting. Asked on Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to Alaska, Trump said the Ukrainian leader “wasn’t a part of it” and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as “really a feel-out,” would be to Zelenskyy “out of respect.” He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy "‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say, ‘we can make a deal.’" The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city’s police force. During his remarks, the president noted how even following “a great call” with Putin in the past, “missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you’d have 60 people laying on a road dying,” a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal. “Now, I will say this, ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” the president added. He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the “best deal that could be made for both parties.” But “there’ll be some swapping, there’ll be some changes in land,” Trump said, returning to the idea of so-called “land swaps,” which he said on Friday would be “to the betterment of both.” Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition. “Next Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.

Article: Even as the 47th president, he still regularly launches late-night, ALL-CAPS social media rants about other countries “LAUGHING ALL THE WAY.” But it’s his fear and loathing of China “laughing” at the United States that he’s made into a firm pillar of his political movement. They will regularly fulminate about China dominating the world and accuse every American leader other than Trump of surrendering our country’s greatness to the “globalists” and “communists.” And yet, less than seven months into Trump’s second term, China is sitting pretty when it comes to its economic, military and diplomatic clout around the world. A country with a huge market that was acting as a bulwark against Chinese economic domination of Asia seems like the kind of ally a president obsessed with China’s ascendance would want. Following Trump’s gutting of Voice of America, China expanded its media operations in Asia and Africa, where the citizenry can get a healthy dose of subtle pro-China propaganda with no pro-America counterpart. In a report released in July, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote, “In private, our allies tell us that Chinese officials are gleeful, characterizing the United States as unreliable. But in many cases, Beijing is doubling down on its own long-term investments — in overseas infrastructure, critical minerals exploitation and exchange programs that bring foreign talent to Chinese universities — all while America withdraws.” It also appears that many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot who is advancing China’s interests at the expense of America’s. Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton wrote in The Hill that some examples of “Trump’s softness” on China “include allowing Nvidia to resume exports of sensitive information technology to China and ignoring legal requirements to ban TikTok or force it to divest its Chinese ownership.” Many Chinese nationalists are, in fact, laughing at the U.S., even as they cheer for Trump, whom they see as an entertaining, useful idiot. Trump has also taken pains to not displease Chinese leader Xi Jinping over Taiwan — which the CCP views as an illegitimate breakaway state that it intends to bring under its yoke someday. The Trump administration last month told Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te to avoid a stopover in New York, according to reporting in The New York Times, which also quoted former Trump administration deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger as saying the U.S. “bent over backwards” to avoid offending China and that “Beijing will pocket this concession and ask for more.” Nicholas Grossman wrote in these pages in April, “If the eventual result is China’s rising to become the world’s predominant power, historians will note that it didn’t take global leadership, America threw it away.” But we don’t have to wait for historians’ take on Trump inexplicably ceding many of America’s long-held advantages on the global stage to China.

Article: Five more Palestinians, including a child, have died of malnutrition as a result of Israel’s punishing blockade of Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, the Health Ministry has said, as people in the enclave and many beyond its besieged borders mourned several journalists assassinated by Israel. The ministry on Monday said most of these victims died in the past three weeks, as Israel-imposed starvation engulfs the entire population, with the total number of severe hunger deaths now at 222, including 101 children. It’s time for statements to turn into action and for an immediate ceasefire.” At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raids across Gaza since dawn on Monday, including six aid seekers, medical sources have told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, on a daily basis, Israeli forces and US contractors are continuing to kill Palestinians desperately seeking aid at distribution points run by the controversial United States and Israeli-backed GHF. An outpouring of grief and condemnation followed the Israeli assassination of five Al Jazeera Arabic staff in Gaza, including prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, in a drone attack late on Sunday that hit a tent for journalists positioned outside the main gate of Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital. The attack came days after the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, warned of “unfounded accusations by the Israeli army” against al-Sharif after Israel repeatedly and falsely accused the 28-year-old reporter of being a Hamas affiliate. He said Israel likely targeted al-Sharif now because of two main factors: first, his important role in “telling the world that there is famine in Gaza”, which “really hurt Israel internationally”; and, second, because of the planned upcoming seizure of Gaza City, which Israel wants to minimise coverage of. Advertisement Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum, who reports for the network’s English channel, said the journalists were “working around the clock to unearth facts on the ground and keep the world informed about what has been going on in Gaza”. Speaking of his colleagues al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, Abu Azzoum said their deliberate killings were being seen in Gaza “as an attempt to silence two of the most courageous voices”.

Article: An explosion at a steel plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States has left one dead and dozens injured or trapped, with emergency workers on site trying to rescue victims, officials said. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it’s like something bad happened.” Dozens were injured and the county was sending 15 ambulances, in addition to the ambulances supplied by local emergency response agencies, Reigner said. Air quality concerns and health warnings The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major US Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers. The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosion and advised residents within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. In another lawsuit, residents said that following a massive 2018 fire, the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs, and was hard to breathe due to the release of sulfur dioxide. Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5m in equipment upgrades and $5m on local clean air efforts and programmes as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by the Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has previously sued US Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” In June, US Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalised a “historic partnership”, a deal that gives the US government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15bn buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after US Steel shareholders approved it.

This is why he formally declared a public safety emergency in the city in a pair of executive orders that placed the Metropolitan Police Department under the federal government control and directed 800 National Guard members into the streets. Trump went even further, seemingly soft-launching the case for potential federal intervention in more Democrat-led cities — Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland — “if they don’t learn their lesson” to address crime. In June, he sent nearly 5,000 troops to Los Angeles — mostly National Guard but also, much more unusually, several hundred Marines — after protests broke out over his immigration policies, blurring the line between the U.S.

Article: Doubt over the accuracy and integrity of the data is a serious issue considering how much BLS work is used to formulate policy, calculate Social Security payments and inform any number of other political and economic decisions. "I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time," DoubleLine CEO Jeffery Gundlach said last week on CNBC. data has never been perfect, but has been of high quality, compiled impartially, and useful in the setting of policy." Questions on multiple fronts Gapen's sentiments mirror those around Wall Street, where written commentary has broken down the various issues the BLS has already faced in terms of budget cuts that have pushed it to alter the way it is collecting some data. Also, notable revisions the BLS has applied to its critical monthly payrolls count have raised concerns, including accusations from Trump that the McEntarfer-led BLS was manipulating the data for political purposes. "We argue the data remain reliable, though we would recommend being careful with the initial jobs data." Looking for inflation clues On the market's plate this week, though, are the two key inflation readings, first with the consumer price index on Tuesday, then the producer price measure, considered a gauge of costs at the wholesale level, on Thursday. At issue for the BLS is its move to stop collecting CPI data from several cities due to staffing limitations, as well as the growing use of imputed data, or estimating price movements in areas where it can't get exact information. In those cases, the BLS will try to use data from another source, preferably somewhere near to the locale it is surveying, but sometimes it has to use prices from other urban areas as assumptions. Bank of America estimates that a combination of different-cell imputation and the varied impact of tariffs likely will alter the headline CPI reading by only a basis point or two — 0.01 or 0.02 percentage point. "Still we do not think the BLS' decision to reduce the CPI sample is enough to warrant alarm over the signal from the inflation data." Impact on Fed moves Indeed, precision will matter as the Federal Reserve closely monitors inflation data and charts its monetary policy course. Excluding food and energy, the respective forecasts for core inflation are 0.3% for the month and 3.1% for the year, the latter up 0.2 percentage point from a month ago. "Sequential firming in inflation is one key factor behind our view that the Fed will remain on hold at the September meeting despite recent employment data that point to a sharp slowdown in labor demand," Morgan Stanley's Gapen wrote. Traders widely expect the central bank to cut the fed funds in September, then at least once more before the end of the year, but Wall Street economists are in multiple camps. "Taken at face value, the new procedures implemented by the BLS should not introduce systematic bias into its estimates of CPI inflation, but it will increase volatility in future CPI prints," Gapen wrote.

Article: Liana Davis alleges Christopher Cooprider secretly dissolved at least 10 abortion pills into a cup of hot chocolate that he prepared for her April 5 and then left the house and stopped responding as she profusely bled, the suit says. Cooprider said he “would like to get rid of it,” the texts show, saying the two were “not in love” or together and that it would be “messed up to bring a child into the world without both parents raising them.” When Cooprider reiterated his desire for Davis to “get rid of it” after her pregnancy test came back positive days later, she asked him to use a different phrase. “I literally feel like I’m going down the steepest hill on a roller coaster when I read that.” The following text messages allegedly show Cooprider telling Davis, without her approval, that he would order abortion pills online.

Article: The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.” Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Article: Trump deploys National Guard to Washington DC and pledges crime crackdown 44 minutes ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News, Washington DC Share Save Watch: Trump announces deployment of National Guard to Washington DC President Donald Trump said he was deploying the National Guard to Washington DC and taking control of the city's police force as he pledged to crack down on crime and homelessness in the city. "I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse," Trump said during a news conference in which he was flanked by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will lead the city's police force while it is under federal control. Mayor Bowser, a Democrat, acknowledged there had been a "terrible" spike in crime in 2023, which mirrored a national trend, but she pushed back against any claims of a crimewave in the city. "The president is very aware of our efforts." When asked about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's comment that Washington is more violent than Baghdad, Bowser said "any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false". That act was instituted by former President Richard Nixon to allow residents of Washington DC - which is the only US city that is not in any of the 50 states - to elect a city council and a mayor. On Sunday, when asked about the possibility of the president taking control of the city's police department, Mayor Bowser said: "There are very specific things in our law that would allow [that]. "We have seen a huge decrease in crime because of those efforts." Watch: DC Mayor Bowser says crime in the city is at a 30-year low As well as crime, Trump also spoke at length about homelessness in Washington DC. "If our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty and they don't respect us." Local groups working with homeless people in the capital told the BBC they had actually seen progress in recent years. Homelessness is down almost 20% for individuals in Washington DC in 2025 compared to five years ago, said Ralph Boyd, the president and chief executive of So Others Might Eat (SOME) - a group that provides people in the city with housing, clothing and other social services.

Article: As this shift to cloud computing took hold, Melius noted that these companies all saw a steep contraction in their price-to-earnings multiples, a classic sign that investors believe slower growth is ahead. The cloud was a priority for CEO Satya Nadella upon taking over in early 2014, and it's paid off handsomely for investors — just take a look at the stock chart versus the S & P 500. Microsoft would have no doubt been on that list of on-premise fallen angels — even if not a hardware play like Hewlett-Packard and Dell — had they not jumped on cloud computing and instead kept their fate tied to the on-premise hardware providers. Instead of companies paying for a perpetual license to use a specific version of software, SaaS companies sold their product on a subscription basis, bringing in a more predictable recurring revenue stream that investors were willing to assign a higher multiple. They added, "We think there will be FOMO across all industries to cut costs and get their stocks up - SaaS is the casualty as AI adoption accelerates." To be sure, while this is a potential concern for Salesforce, plenty of other tech names in the portfolio stand to benefit. Indeed, the Melius analysts themselves contend: "While SaaS should be avoided, 'Software' companies with clouds [such as Microsoft and Oracle] are continuing to see acceleration in demand." "Another area fueling demand is the acceleration of AI agents that do the work of SaaS and fuel demand for more compute," Melius added. Agentic AI is a type of AI system that can complete certain tasks without human intervention, and it's become a big area of investment and focus in the AI race — including for Salesforce. And given that SaaS is generally based on the seat-based licensing model, if Salesforce's customers have fewer employees because their remaining ones are using AI to be more productive, that translates to less demand for software seats — all else being equal. Instead, the company is working to build out its agentic AI offering, appropriately dubbed Agentforce, so that it can help clients move more quickly into the AI era, while also building out a new AI-oriented revenue stream that can hopefully help extract more revenue from those seats at customers that do remain. Unlike Adobe, it's also important to keep in mind that Salesforce is targeted almost exclusively toward enterprise, where the customer cohort tends to be more sticky and a bit slower to change things up, lest they risk a misstep that hurts sales. While Salesforce isn't alone in offering tools to build Agents — Microsoft, which competes with Salesforce in the CRM arena, also has them — the company clearly has a strategy. As a result, we're downgrading shares of Salesforce to a hold-equivalent 2 rating as we look to better understand to what extent Salesforce is being disrupted, or if can indeed adapt to the new world.

When he was arrested at a New York City Airbnb apartment in June 2024, he had over $37,000 in cash and nearly 1,500 stolen account access numbers in his possession, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. He worked with multiple people internationally in the scheme, with one accomplice receiving more than 36,000 stolen EBT card numbers from Graur over the course of three years, the statement said.

Article: JERUSALEM, Israel — Israel’s military targeted an Al Jazeera correspondent with an airstrike Sunday, killing him, another network journalist and at least six other people, all of whom were sheltering outside Gaza City's largest hospital complex. Al Jazeera calls strike ‘assassination’ Al Jazeera called the strike “targeted assassination” and accused Israeli officials of incitement, connecting al-Sharif's death to the allegations that both the network and correspondent had denied. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,” the Qatari network said in a statement. Al Jazeera is among the few outlets still fielding a big team of reporters inside the besieged strip, chronicling daily life amid airstrikes, hunger and the rubble of destroyed neighborhoods. The network has suffered heavy losses during the war, including 27-year-old correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul and cameraman Rami al-Rifi, killed last summer, and freelancer Hossam Shabat, killed in an Israeli airstrike in March. In a social media post that Al Jazeera said was written to be posted in case of his death, he bemoaned the devastation and destruction that war had wrought and bid farewell to his wife, son and daughter. The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that at least 186 have been killed in Gaza, and Brown University’s Watson Institute in April said the war was “quite simply, the worst ever conflict for reporters.” Al-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, on July 31 said that the killings were “part of a deliberate strategy of Israel to suppress the truth, obstruct the documentation of international crimes and bury any possibility of future accountability.” The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Sunday that it was appalled by the strike. “Israel’s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” Sara Qudah, the group's regional director, said in a statement.

Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, “The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin” but it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow. To that point, Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to “tell them what kind of a deal — I’m not going to make a deal. It’s not up to me to make a deal.” Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Trump’s up and down relations with Putin More recently, Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn’t appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn’t done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday’s meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow’s sphere of influence. Europeans will prepare with a virtual meeting on Ukraine this week With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday. The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and “related issues of territorial claims and security.” Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government “has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force” and that Ukraine should decide its own fate “independently and autonomously.” Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles (418 kilometers) east of Moscow. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Article: Barcelona’s domination of Real Madrid last season resulted in Los Blancos bringing an end to Carlo Ancelotti’s second tenure – even though he had delivered a league and European double a year previous. Rumours rumbled for most of the season, after a low-key start at home and abroad, that former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso would be making the switch from Bayer Leverkusen to replace Ancelotti. With their La Liga and UEFA Champions League defence over, the Madrid-based club wasted little time in announcing Alonso, conveniently at a time when Brazil cranked up their interest in Ancelotti. The first match of the new Spanish campaign is on Friday, August 15 and sees Girona, who finished only a point above the relegation zone last season, entertain a Rayo Vallecano side that claimed ninth spot in La Liga last year. It has been a quiet transfer window for Barcelona, whose finances had been heavily in the spotlight last year with La Liga rules limiting spending on wages and transfers – complicating the registration of Dani Olmo. The Spanish international arrived from RB Leipzig in Germany for a fee of $62.5m in the summer of 2024, but was nearly forced into a free transfer away from the Catalan club due to their dire financial situation. The loan of Marcus Rashford, who made his debut in the 5-0 pre-season demolition of Como, from Manchester United is Barca’s only major addition in the off season to their ranks so far. A 4-0 demolition of Real in Madrid on October 26 kicked off the derbies last season, the first major warning signs that Los Blancos may have a turbulent ride ahead. That defeat for Ancelotti’s side was compounded by a 5-2 hammering in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, before a 3-2 Copa Del Rey final win for Barca in late April left Real facing up to the prospect of a trophyless season. The lack of any major additions to Barcelona’s title-winning squad will throw doubt on whether manager Hansi Flick will be able to push the players to go again without further competition for places. Flick’s side will be fully expected to put up a stern defence of their La Liga title and to go all the way in the Champions League, a competition they were heavily favourites to win last season until their shock semifinal elimination by Inter Milan. Real Madrid will have to cope with the loss of Luka Modric in midfield, only a year after the retirement of Toni Kroos – an absence believed to have heavily contributed to Real’s demise last season. Nonetheless, the link-up between an attack and midfield, which is now missing both of its mainstays for more than a decade, will be the major problem for Alonso to solve. Alongside fellow countryman Julian Alvarez, France and Atletico legend Antoine Griezmann, and Giuliano Simeone, the son of the manager, Almada could well sprinkle the magic needed to elevate Atletico to the top of the pile.

Article: Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County? The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 — on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas. (Aung Shine Oo / Associated Press) Advertisement “It came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,” said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech. Geological Survey) Advertisement The magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine’s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. “It’s not going to come soon, because it’s quite a heavy calculation.” Still, such simulations would provide a model of “all possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.” Rescuers work at the site of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, that collapsed after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake centered in Myanmar on March 28. Or it could be a much larger earthquake — rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. By comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake’s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley — related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7. But while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike. “It is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.” A Buddhist monk walks near a collapsed pagoda on March 30 after an earthquake in central Myanmar. stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.” “And then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,” Avouac said. The entire length of the Sagaing fault — including areas that didn’t rupture in the March earthquake — is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate. These maps show the 317 miles of the Sagaing fault that ruptured in March, compared to the historical ruptures, as outlined in a 2016 study, of the San Andreas fault in California in 1730, 1812, 1857 and 1906. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956. “There’s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.” Advertisement There is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a “Big One” simply won’t ever strike California again. “If there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won’t hold forever.” Further research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said. The other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.

Article: (AP) — The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. “Some water did come in, it’s stinky water, we think it’s sewage, but we’ll be OK.” The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon’s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he’s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters in an inflatable boat on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away as the Root River flooded a road in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee.

Article: As punishment for flouting her order and being found in civil contempt, the judge required Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to file bimonthly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions have been made under the law. In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report. In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law. “ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

Article: The Israeli military last year accused six Al Jazeera journalists — including Anas al-Sharif whom Israel said it had targeted in its attack on Gaza City on Sunday — of being fighters with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. Al Jazeera denied the accusations, which it said were based on “fabricated evidence.” The Israeli military in 2024 killed Ismail al-Ghoul, an Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza, claiming he was a member of Hamas’s military wing, along with a cameraman, Rami al-Rifee, who was not accused of involvement with the militant group. Al Jazeera called the accusation “baseless.” Israel has banned all foreign journalists from independently entering Gaza to cover the war since the conflict was ignited by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. As a result, Al Jazeera’s Palestinian correspondents in Gaza have provided much of the on-the-ground coverage of the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and led to mass privation and hunger in the enclave.

While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, reaching prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling global trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower tariffs at a meeting between negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland. The relationship is very good with [China’s] President Xi [Jinping] and myself.” “We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian in a statement. Even as both countries appeared to be seeking to push back the reinstatement of duties, US trade envoy Jamieson Greer said last month that Trump will have the “final call” on any such extension. Ongoing negotiations Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump’s first term and now with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said she expected Trump to extend the 90-day “tariff detente” for another 90 days later on Monday. “The whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations, and there’s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,” she said.

Article: Trump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”. ‘Represent ourselves’ The rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia. Advertisement The city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.” In March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.” For many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community. Amari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. For his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”. Among those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.” “There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said. While DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data. Groups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”. Twenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”. Tanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred. ‘Best place for us to resist’ Maurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime. “When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.” “It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”

Article: At the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky this morning, Ford executives announced that they plan to retool the factory so they can roll out a midsize pickup truck in the $30,000 range within 18 months. This has long been the goal for a number of automakers: a truly affordable EV — one that competes with gas cars when it comes to the upfront sticker price, without factoring in government subsidies or the savings from gasoline. And they fizzled out." But after canceling its large electric SUV and just recently delaying a next-generation of electric full-size trucks and vans, Ford held this splashy event in Louisville to make it clear it was moving forward — really — with this project. Political headwinds, global realities Technically, what Ford announced is not just a single vehicle but a vehicle platform, which will eventually be adapted into a variety of vehicles that are all built the same way. The Kentucky plant, which currently makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will close for renovations and retooling, and reopen with 2,200 jobs, 600 fewer people than it employs now. Demand for battery-powered cars has come in lower than carmakers' expectations, and with federal tax credits expiring at the end of September , that trend is expected to slow even more. In a nod to those past challenges, Ford executives repeatedly said the new vehicle had to be "sustainable" — a reference not to the environmental benefits of EVs, but to the need for the car to be sustainable as a business proposition. And, at risk of understatement, companies don't always make their initial price targets; the F-150 Lightning and the Cybertruck were both first promised to start at $40,000, a price they never actually hit. Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research at the automotive insights firm Telemetry, said that while there's no guarantee that Ford can pull this off, the new price target is "plausible." "Most of what we know so far about what Ford is doing is not actually entirely new" for the EV industry, he said. Ford plans on reducing costs and complexity by using a small number of very large die-cast metal pieces for a truck's body, instead of a large number of small pieces; that's an innovation Tesla pioneered. And while he made promises about high-tech features and the future, executives also told workers in the plant they could look forward to a more mundane benefit from the $2 billion investment: When the plant reopens next year, Ford VP Bryce Currie told the assembled workers, it would have tempered air — and a much cooler temperature.

President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation’s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals,” even though crime numbers in Washington are falling.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. crackdown Analysis by Jonathan Allen Donald Trump isn’t the first president to deploy troops and federal agents in the name of safeguarding the nation’s capital, but he has been particularly selective about what represents a threat to the peace. In the summer of 2020, Trump amassed a heavily armed force in Lafayette Square, steps from the White House, and unleashed it on peaceful protesters demonstrating against unprovoked police violence. In appointing himself Washington’s top cop, he promised to clean up a city that he described as having been “overtaken” by “bloodthirsty criminals.” Attorney General Pam Bondi went a step further, vowing that “crime in D.C. That should make it easier for Trump to keep this promise — he can just take credit for what was already in motion — than the ones that have fallen short: ending inflation and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, among others. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was overrun by drug lords — the mayor at the time was arrested after he was caught smoking crack cocaine — and it was known as the murder capital of the world. In the meantime, he has portrayed himself again as a proponent of “law and order” — so long as it serves his political ends — which could allow him to position himself to take credit for a relatively safe and prosperous city, and leave Democrats to fight over how much crime-fighting is too much. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images To better understand how two candidates as ideologically opposed as President Donald Trump and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani could rise to prominence, just ask Ray. (Ray declined to share his last name out of concern that he could face backlash for his political views.) I first spoke with Ray in January when we reached out to some of the swing voters who propelled Trump to victory last year. “But he makes the effort to go out and talk to people and reach out to people and try to actually do things that are better for the working class.” The son of Asian immigrants, Ray has not always been tuned into politics. He registered as a Democrat to have a say in the deep blue city’s politics and because the party supported policies he benefitted from as a kid, like public education, school lunches and afterschool programs. “When I was voting for Biden, it was the expectation that things will go back to normal,” Ray said, later adding, “The problem is we never really got the normalcy.” So he cast his ballot for Trump in 2024, the first time he had ever supported a Republican. “It’s not about Republicans or Democrats in my mind,” Ray said, adding that he is drawn to a candidate “who is honest, who’s authentic, and someone who has the benefits of the little person in the back of their mind.” “I think having that’s important, and I think that’s what’s missing in the politics these days,” he said. 🗞️ Today's other top stories 🌏 Russia-Ukraine latest: Trump said he would try to return territory to Ukraine as he prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lay the groundwork for a deal to bring an end to the war.

Article: DALLAS — North Texas' ongoing population boom means more hospitals and medical facilities are needed to meet the region's healthcare needs -- particularly as rural hospitals around the state and beyond struggle financially. John Henderson of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals recently warned that a third of the 157 rural hospitals in Texas have less than 10 days' cash on hand. "In some of the rural areas, the hospitals are struggling from a financial point of view, a cash-flow point of view and, as a result, they may have to cut back services, which creates a gap, or they may even have to close units," DFW Hospital Council CEO Steve Love said. "Some of the rural hospitals in Texas, unfortunately, have closed labor and delivery because of not having enough physicians, and not having the staff." To help fill gaps in healthcare access and accommodate steep growth in the population centers of North Texas, a number of new medical facilities have either recently opened or are in the works across the northern sectors of the Metroplex. Aside from building new hospitals, Love said he expects North Texas will also see more outpatient clinics and "probably as much focus as possible on telemedicine," as the population continues to grow. So here’s a look at the different facilities major health systems have recently opened or are coming soon to North Texas -- and how the entities behind these new facilities are deciding where to put them. Map of hospitals and facilities recently opened or in the works in North Texas Baylor Scott & White Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest nonprofit health system in Texas, officially opened Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Frisco at PGA Parkway, a new 340,000-square-foot, 84-bed hospital, earlier this summer. "Baylor Scott & White is committed to expanding access to high-quality care built on a legacy of clinical excellence," said Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Frisco at PGA Parkway President Ryan Gebhart when asked when the facility brings to the table. "As North Texas continues to grow, this new medical center is poised to meet the needs of a thriving region." Baylor Scott & White – Frisco at PGA Parkway Chief Medical Officer Eric Beshires said the new facility was designed to continue to meet the needs of North Texas into the future. "As we enter our third decade of Baylor Scott & White's service within the City of Frisco, we are committed to continuing to grow with the community to meet the changing needs of this area." Medical City Medical City Healthcare has expansion projects in the works across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a particular focus on fast-growing Collin County and Fort Worth, the 11th largest city in the country. "As the North Texas region continues to grow and evolve, Medical City Healthcare is strategically expanding to ensure families have access to the essential services they need, including emergency care, mental healthcare, hospital services, and specialized programs," Medical City spokesperson Janet St. "Expansion is focused on underserved communities or areas experiencing rapid population growth, where we can make the greatest impact on community health and provide timely, expert and compassionate care close to home." In the last five years, Medical City says the health system has invested more than $1.7 billion in everything from building acquisitions and expansion to facility enhancements and technology. Medical City Mental Health & Wellness Center Alliance – a 65,000-square-foot, single-story hospital providing inpatient and outpatient services at 3100 Alliance Town Center in Fort Worth – opened in February to provide access to inpatient mental healthcare in the area. That same year, Medical City bought Medical City Mental Health and Wellness Center Frisco at 5680 Frisco Square Boulevard, and Medical City Sachse, a campus of Medical City Plano at 4750 President George Bush Highway that provides 24/7 emergency care. In 2023 Medical City acquired Medical City Decatur, a campus of Medical Center Denton at 609 Medical Center Drive, which is a full-service, acute care hospital with 150 beds, with the goal of "maintaining vital hospital access in a more rural community." This year, work is underway on a new, three-story patient tower at Medical City Arlington that will add 60 more patient care beds, bringing the total thee to 496. The space will house a 28-bed cardiovascular intensive care unit, specially-equipped ICU beds for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (an advanced life support therapy for patients whose heart or lungs are not functioning properly) and shell space for additional beds in the future. Finally, Medical City McKinney is planning a three-story expansion of its own that will add 28 more patient beds for a total of 357, plus four operating rooms, a new post-anesthesia care unit and additional space for day surgery. And Medical City Plano is expanding with 60 more patient beds, bringing the total there to 663, as well as three rooftop helipads, a three-story parking garage and shell space for future patient beds. Located about 40 miles north of downtown Dallas, Celina was the fastest-growing American city among cities and towns with a population of at least 20,000 between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the U.S Census Bureau. We run to it." Celina Mayor Ryan Tubbs said the facility is the third-largest employer in the city, aside from the school district and the city itself, with about 250 full time employees. "Just having that facility in its close proximity really lends itself to quality patient care to our residents and the residents of the surrounding area." Before it opened, EMS had to transport patients to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in McKinney, about 14 miles from Celina, which is also expanding. "You may think that a lot of these hospitals are competitors with each other, but I think what I see from behind the scenes is you have very much relationships where they want to work together, where it's really about the patient." Texas Health Resources To help meet the increasing need for services in the area, Texas Health Resources is building the first full-service hospital in Forney. “There is a need with the fast growth in population in the Forney area to really expand care,” said Toya White, who serves as president at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Kaufman and will serve as president of the future Texas Health Hospital Forney. Expanding access to care is something that we’re always evaluating, and really how to meet our population demands.” A spokesperson for the city of Forney said the facility will provide essential services as well as jobs to the community. Along with strong commercial growth, the addition of a world-class, full-service healthcare facility like Texas Health Resources is a tremendous step for Forney," Forney spokesperson Zach Smith said in a statement. "This hospital will not only provide essential services to our residents but will also create high-quality jobs." Texas Health Resources Senior Executive Vice President Laura Irvine said the health system considers population and other demographics when considering where and what types of healthcare facilities are needed in an area. What are the healthcare services that they need, healthcare utilization and what are those current access points.” Beyond demographics, Irvine said Texas Health considers advances in technology to determine what services are needed. We want to make sure we’re matching not just the population and volume of the growth but the type of healthcare needs that they will have.” Irvine said Texas Health has seen the use of e-visits, or virtual visits, increase about threefold in the last year. Explained Irvine: “We’ll want to work with them, make sure they know the services that we’ll be providing from Day 1, and how we’ll work with their EMS and ambulance services that will hopefully provide for them a much faster access for their ambulances than where they are currently driving to." Irvine said the health system also partners with cities and school districts where they plan to build facilities. One example Irvine shared: Texas Health Resources, Forney ISD and the Forney Education Department are partnering on community events and health and wellness initiatives like a Forney ISD back-to-school rally. As health systems plan for new hospitals, Irvine said they work to ensure they have enough land to expand to in the future and that they have planned out where new patient towers or other expansions could go. Late last year, Texas Health Resources also bought 21 acres of land in fast-growing Collin County at the northwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and the Collin County Outer Loop in Celina with plans of expanding there in the future as well. UT Southwestern UT Southwestern broke ground in May on a $177 million radiation oncology campus in Fort Worth to meet a growing need for cancer treatment, officials with the health system said. The 65,000-square-foot facility in Fort Worth's Medical District will include the city’s first MRI-guided precision radiation treatment, four linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation treatment (plus space for two more) and a fully-equipped brachytherapy suite to provide high-dose radiation treatments for patients with prostate or gynecologic cancers. The pediatric health complex will be located on more than 33 acres at the corner of Harry Hines Boulevard and Paul Bass Way, and it will reportedly replace the existing Children’s Medical Center Dallas. In addition to 24-hour nursing care, the hospital will offer physical, occupational and speech therapy, as well as private rooms, a therapy gym, an in-house dialysis suite, a dining room, and pharmacy. JPS Health Network, Cook Children's Health Network, the city of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, LVTRise and WestAid Food Pantry have partnered to bring a 40,000-sq-ft health center to the neighborhood, with the ribbon-cutting held August 5 at 2800 S. “The collaboration that has gone into this center is what truly makes it so special, and I’m really honored to say that Cook Children’s is a part of it,” said Rick W. Their fingerprints are all over this project and will continue to guide how we evolve in this space to best serve them.” The neighborhood health center marks the first time JPS Health Network and Cook Children's have partnered to offer healthcare in one facility.

Article: NFL recommends enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following NYC shooting The NFL is recommending enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following a shooting last month at a Manhattan office tower by a gunman authorities say was targeting league headquarters. "However, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities." Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building's lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on July 28, before he killed himself, authorities said. Police said Tamura had a history of mental illness, and a rambling note found on his body suggested that he had a grievance against the NFL over a claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be diagnosed only by examining the brain after a person dies.

Article: DAKAR, Senegal — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: How it was found Sotheby’s said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

While the use of the military on American streets is alarming, it should be just as scary how blatantly this president is tying race not just to crime, but to violence so uncontrollable it requires military troops to stop it. It’s a big part of American history and our justice system has unfortunately been steeped in it, from the Jim Crow era to the 1990s war on drugs, which targeted inner cities with the same rhetoric that Trump is recycling now. Trump pointed out some tragic and horrific examples — including the beating of Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, a former employee of the president’s Department of Government Efficiency who was attacked after attempting to defend a woman during a carjacking recently, not far from the White House. But the exploitation we are seeing from Trump is a dangerous precedent to justify military force for domestic law enforcement, which until now has been forbidden — or at least assumed forbidden — by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. While it’s uncertain how that case will resolve, “Los Angeles could provide a bit of a road map for any jurisdiction seeking to push back against the Trump administration when there’s a potential threat of sending in federal troops,” Jessica Levinson, a constitutional legal scholar at Loyola Law School, told me.

Article: The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development. President Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday press conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the “obsolete” H20 chip to China. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,” Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. “Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.” The top Democrat on the panel also raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

Article: Iran’s talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be “technical” and “complicated”, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said, ahead of a visit by the United Nations nuclear watchdog for the first time since Tehran cut ties with it last month in the wake of the June conflict triggered by Israeli strikes. Esmaeil Baghaei, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that a meeting may be organised with Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi during the IAEA’s visit, “but it is a bit soon to predict what the talks will result since these are technical talks, complicated talks”. The IAEA’s visit marks the first to Iran since President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country on July 3 to suspend its cooperation with the nuclear watchdog after an intensive 12-day war with Israel. Pezeshkian told Al Jazeera in an interview last month that his country is prepared for any future war Israel might wage against it, adding that he was not optimistic about the ceasefire between the countries. Relations between the IAEA and Iran deteriorated after the watchdog’s board said on June 12 that Iran had breached its non-proliferation obligations, a day before Israel’s air strikes over Iran, which sparked the conflict. “Peaceful facilities of a country that was under 24-hour monitoring were the target of strikes, and the agency refrained from showing a wise and rational reaction and did not condemn it as it was required,” he said. Araghchi had previously said that cooperation with the agency, which will now require approval by Iran’s highest security body, the Supreme National Security Council, would be about redefining how both sides cooperate.

Article: Now, they're gearing up to fight again DALLAS — The Skillman Southwestern Library branch is once again slated for closure in Dallas' proposed municipal budget, reigniting a community fight that neighbors thought they had won a year ago. "I'm so angry and I'm so disappointed and I'm heartbroken and I was always heartbroken at the thought of losing this library and losing the staff." Community members Ashley Grossman and Caitlin Dolt, who are both part of a "Friends of Skillman Southwestern Library" group, are preparing to fight the closure again, too. "It's time to do exactly what we did last year again." The proposed budget reflects the city's commitment to public safety, with plans to hire 350 police recruits and retain seasoned officers with a goal of ending the fiscal year with 3,424 sworn police officers. "There just has to be a balance somewhere and there has to be a limit at some point." The repeated fight for the library's survival has taken an emotional toll on residents. The budget documents show the city plans to evaluate closing up to four more library branches in the 2026-2027 budget year as the library system moves to "regionalize" library services.

Article: Here’s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute: But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible “illicit international trafficking,” claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — It’s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth — a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said. Niger’s government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite’s discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was “akin to illicit international trafficking.” Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of “precious stones, semiprecious stones and meteorites nationwide” in an effort to ensure their traceability. What international law says Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property — which Niger and the U.S. However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to be able to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S. “If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,” she told the AP.

Article: Ralph Norman admitted that Trump’s tariffs are already causing higher prices, but told the American people it’s “for the good of the country.” The South Carolina Republican’s comments were met with immediate criticism, including from “The Weekend” co-hosts Jonathan Capehart and Eugene Daniels, who discussed the impact of Trump’s trade war with fellow MSNBC host Ali Velshi on Sunday. After playing a clip of Norman’s remarks, Capehart pointed out the glaring hypocrisy: “I’m sorry, wait — he said it’s for the good of the country that costs are higher? They just beat the hell out of Joe Biden when he was president because of high prices.” Daniels said Norman showed that Republicans are “accepting the reality” of his trade war. Velshi chimed in and called the tariffs “nonsensical,” going on to say the real losers are America’s small businesses, who have “no leverage.” He added: “They have no lobbying, they have no ability to negotiate, they have no ability to even determine what boat their stuff gets on. Farmers, ranchers — any small business, they can’t do this.” Velshi also discussed Trump’s “dangerous” threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, pointing out “two very distinct problems.” He explained: “Every major industrialized country has a central bank, and they all follow similar rules to make sure that the person who’s the head of the government doesn’t influence. And the problem here is that he wants to influence that.” The second problem, Velshi said, is that “inflation is a much harder problem to handle than recession.” When it comes to a recession, “the government can put money into the economy. It almost wrecked America’s future in the ’80s.” Velshi pointed out that the president has tried to exert this level of control across the government but said the scale of his attacks on the Fed is a cause for grave concern: “This is what Donald Trump is doing all over government, but he’s doing it writ large here and it’s really dangerous.”

Article: CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched attacks Monday in a famine-stricken displacement camp outside of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, killing 40 people, local rights groups said. The Emergency Response Rooms group working at the Abu Shouk displacement camp said in a statement on Facebook that the RSF — which is at war with the Sudanese military — raided parts of the camp targeting citizens inside their homes. Meanwhile, the Resistance Committees in el-Fasher confirmed the attacks, saying on Facebook that the scene “reflected the extent of the horrific violations committed against innocent, defenseless people.” The Resistance Committees are a group of local citizens from the community that includes human rights activists. “Our forces repelled a large-scale attack from several axes by the terrorist militia and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in lives and equipment, as more than 16 combat vehicles were destroyed and burned and 34 vehicles, including armored cars, were captured,” the army claimed in a statement. Meanwhile, in North Kordofan province the RSF has been accused of displacing over 3,000 families from 66 villages due to fighting since early August, according to the Sudan Doctors Network.

Article: The Times reached out to two sources with scenarios that challenge conventional thinking — two plans for the San Fernando Valley, which, half a century ago, provided the space for much of the city’s growth. Vestiges of Reseda’s small-town beginning still survive in block after block of single-story businesses like the Traders pawnbroker and jewelry store at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way. How many more of those would be needed for Reseda, or any similar community, to contribute its fair share of the state’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the city of Los Angeles? The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. Here's how the Pacific Urbanism hybrid model could work The reimagined Reseda includes 37 buildings of 100 or more units, 73 medium-size buildings of 25 to 99 units and 484 duplex and small apartment buildings of up to 24 units. 1 MILE The low-density area could see a variety of new building sizes with the largest added along the main corridors At the moment the majority of the structures are one to four unit properties. Those changes have helped, but don’t “get us anywhere close to what’s needed to meet the target, much less in an equitable way where all communities contribute a fair share,” Alvarez said. Pacific Urbanism proposes upgrading the zoning from medium- to high-density near the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way and creating medium-density zones to replace much of what is now single-family residences and small businesses. Bury the transmission lines; build on top If you’ve spent time in the San Fernando Valley, it would be easy to view the overhead electrical transmission lines that stretch for more than 20 miles simply as essential wallpaper of modern living. The lines help ensure that 1.6 million households and businesses across the city can turn on the lights through a mostly uninterrupted band of 100- to 200-foot tall towers on a 150-foot wide strip of land.

Article: Paxton argued that the group was deceptively fundraising for and illegally helping support Texas Democrats as they fanned out to Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York to deny the House the headcount needed to pass legislation. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted Paxton's request for a temporary injunction, barring O'Rourke and Powered by People from fundraising for the Democrats or spending money to cover their expenses. SEE ALSO: Texas House Democrats remain out of state as redistricting showdown continues In her ruling, Fahey agreed with Paxton's contention that Powered by People engaged in false, misleading or deceptive fundraising practices, and by distributing funds to Texas Democrats, writing in the ruling that the group either "directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators" to violate state law and House procedures. The group cannot use political funds to pay for travel or accommodations for "unexcused Texas legislators during any special legislative session called by the Texas Governor as consideration for a violation of such legislators' Constitutional duties." O'Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton Friday in the El Paso district court. In a statement responding to the injunction, O'Rourke said Paxton was trying to "make examples out of those who fight so that others won't." "Paxton is trying to shut down Powered by People, one of the largest voter registration organizations in the country, because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections, the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump, and Abbott have on power in Texas," O'Rourke said.

Article: Donald Trump’s gambits to strong-arm American companies to conform with his political agenda — be they law firms, universities or chip manufacturers — have exposed the fundamental disdain for democratic principles now being practiced by the party of “free enterprise.” Tan is the latest target. Tan visited the White House on Monday, a meeting that followed a post from Trump’s Truth Social account last week accusing him of being “conflicted” and demanding that he resign “immediately.” As Media Matters researcher Matt Gertz noted, the post from Trump’s account came minutes after a Fox Business report on a letter sent by Sen. (Tan, who was born in Malaysia, joins TikTok CEO Shou Chu as a target of Cotton’s Joseph McCarthy-esque crusade against businesspeople with ties to China.) In the letter, Cotton referred to Reuters’ reporting on Tan’s private investments and his previous job at Cadence, a tech company that recently reached a settlement in which it pleaded guilty to illegally selling semiconductor design technology to a Chinese military university. (A spokesperson for Intel told Reuters that Tan had answered questionnaires that included “disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest” and that the company handles such conflicts “appropriately.”) After Monday’s meeting, another post from Trump’s Truth Social account referred to Tan’s rise as an “amazing story” and said Tan and White House Cabinet members are going to “bring suggestions to me during the next week.” Intel released a statement calling the meeting “candid and constructive” and said the company appreciates “the President’s strong leadership.” But as the mercurial president wields his influence, it’s worth noting the facts don’t appear to be as scandalous as Trump or Cotton have implied. In a memo to staff published to Intel’s website Thursday, Tan denounced “misinformation” being spread about him and said he’s “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” The lack of any demonstrable culpability for Tan arguably highlights how blatantly authoritarian Trump’s push to oust him truly is. It’s certainly ironic that the president who eagerly welcomed Elon Musk into the fold despite his financial entanglements with China and their related national security concerns would turn around and insist that the business leader of an independent company must step down over his alleged ties to China.

Article: Trump ordered a takeover of Washington’s police President Trump said yesterday that he was temporarily taking control of the police force in Washington and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in the U.S. During a news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington, a city that he said had been taken over by “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth.” His remarks contrasted with official figures showing that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low. Trump added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” Trump has been threatening to take federal control of Washington for weeks, but he has railed against crime in largely liberal cities for decades. The Washington deployment is the latest example of Trump using the military to achieve his domestic goals; earlier this year, he sent 4,700 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles and deployed some 10,000 troops to the U.S.

Alexander McKellar offered to take her to the spot where the body was buried – and her quick thinking was crucial in cracking a case which had baffled police for three years. Tony's son Mike said that without Caroline's intervention, it was unlikely that his body would ever have been found – and expressed the family's gratitude for what she had done. Police Scotland Tony Parsons was described as a loving father, grandfather and friend Mike Parsons told BBC Scotland News that his dad was the kind of man who was always determined to complete any challenge he set himself. "I actually texted him myself, with what is my dad and myself's sense of humour, a simple text: 'Are you still alive?' "Looking back now, it's not nice to know that was the very last thing I texted to him, knowing at this point he would have been passed away." Caroline Muirhead became a key witness in a murder investigation after her boyfriend of two months confessed he killed a man. "But I basically had to convince my mum there was still a chance, and lying to somebody like that is not easy." Mike Parsons said the McKellar brothers' actions were inhumane Despite numerous public appeals including an appearance by Mike on Crimewatch, it seemed that Tony Parsons had vanished into thin air. Police had spoken to the brothers after an anonymous letter in August 2018 said they were in the Bridge of Orchy Hotel the night Tony Parsons had vanished, but no further action was taken. Crown Office The can of Red Bull dropped at the burial site allowed police to locate Tony Parsons' body It was later revealed that Tony's injuries were so bad that he would only have survived for 20 or 30 minutes without help - but it was unlikely that he had died instantly.

"Being brutally honest, I'm not so sure if I was in the same situation I would have done and thought the same way. "From my perspective, I have nothing but massive amounts of gratitude for that, because had she not done that and put herself into these positions, then we would never have found my dad's body." Tony's body was recovered from the grave in January 2021 after a two-day operation by specialist officers.

Article: The Justice Department is pressing the high court to take a Second Amendment case about a federal law that bars firearm possession by a person who “is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” The issue is due for consideration in the court’s Sept. While Maxwell’s case is far from a sure thing for review — it takes four justices to agree, and they reject most petitions — the Second Amendment issue presents a more likely candidate, at least as it’s presented by the DOJ. In its petition in the case of Ali Danial Hemani — whose prosecution, the government said, is based on his “habitual use of marijuana” — the Trump administration urged the justices to grant review because a lower court said the gun law is unconstitutional. The petition said the high court “has recently and repeatedly reviewed decisions invalidating federal statutes even in the absence of a circuit conflict.” The administration also said there is such a circuit conflict, meaning different federal appeals courts around the country ruling on an issue differently, leaving it to the justices to resolve the dispute nationwide. Hemani’s case and the [appeals court] decision below”; they said that the 5th Circuit didn’t invalidate the federal law in all its applications and that there’s no circuit split needing resolution. Solicitor General John Sauer maintained that the appeal “presents an important Second Amendment issue that affects hundreds of prosecutions every year: whether the government may disarm individuals who habitually use unlawful drugs but are not necessarily under the influence while possessing a firearm.” Though the government’s petition is a plausible candidate for review, it’s ultimately up to the justices whether and when to step in. Notably, they haven’t taken every Second Amendment appeal presented to them over the years, to the chagrin of gun rights advocates and some of the justices, such as Clarence Thomas, who lamented upon the court’s declining to consider a different gun appeal in June that the right to bear arms remains a “second-class” one without the court’s vigilance in enforcing it. Rahimi, a lopsided court ruled 8-1 that the Second Amendment permits temporarily disarming people who have been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another person.

Despite a career that unfolded in fits and starts due to racial tensions, a troubled marriage and the challenges of single motherhood, Jordan recorded one of the most beloved vocal jazz records of the 1960s, Portrait of Sheila on Blue Note Records, and was recognized 50 years later by the National Endowment of the Arts as a Jazz Master, the genre's highest honor. "That's the one I'll dedicate my life to." Jordan, who was white, became good friends with Parker — he called her "the lady with the million dollar ears." In 1952, she married one of his close collaborators, Duke Jordan, and went on to work with many Black jazz artists, often facing prejudice from other white people because of it. "That's how I survived, knowing that once or twice a week I'd get a sitter for Traci, and I'd go and sing in this club, and then I'd get up the next morning and go do my day gig."

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File) MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls — the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon — out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. “We all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,” said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab. That’s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023. Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said “it’s very little,” but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals. So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year. Zambrano highlights that his team’s work has shown that conservation works and that the effort to protect the species is also improving water quality, increasing the number of pollinizers in the area and means that Mexico City makes better use of Xochimilco’s water, among other benefits.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel — New video footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. B’Tselem says it obtained the video from the family of Awdah Hathaleen, 31, an activist, English teacher and father of three who was shot and killed on July 28, and who they said had filmed it. Levi, who is shown firing his gun twice in a video shot by another witness and obtained by The Associated Press, was briefly detained and then released from house arrest by an Israeli court, which cited lack of evidence. The shooting occurred in Umm al-Khair, a village that has long weathered settler violence in an area profiled in the Oscar-winning film “No Other Land.” Settler attacks on Palestinians have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as have attacks by Palestinian militants. “Awdah’s killing is another horrific example of how Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank, are currently living without any sort of protection, fully exposed to Israeli violence, while Israeli soldiers or settlers can kill them in broad daylight and enjoy full impunity while the world watches,” said Sarit Michaeli, the international outreach director for B’Tselem.

Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference near district headquarters, saying that the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding “safe zones” around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.” At least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools. Advertisement The public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, “all the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,” said Carvalho, with the goal of “explaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.” The district also has created a “compassion fund” to provide general help for families, including legal assistance. Los Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which, along with the City of Los Angeles, includes all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.

Article: used to tell children in his youth group in Maryland that it was normal for a pastor to kiss boys on the lips, because that’s how Jesus greeted his disciples, according to an arrest warrant made public last week. Pinkerton, 52, a youth minister known as Pastor Tommy, is being held without bond following accusations that he sexually abused six teens from 2006 to 2010 while working at Central Christian Church, an Assemblies of God church in Baltimore County. He gave his life to the community, worked for the community,” Hollimon said, adding that he filed a motion Monday morning seeking another bond hearing for Pinkerton after a judge denied his release last week. “He’s anxiously waiting his day in court.” Pinkerton’s arrest comes as the Assemblies of God, the world’s largest Pentecostal denomination, with nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches in the United States, is grappling with a string of child sex abuse allegations. As part of an ongoing investigation into the denomination’s handling of abuse claims, NBC News published an investigation last week based on interviews, emails, court filings and police reports that examined how an Assemblies of God college ministry guided hundreds of students to the home of Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender lauded by some as “the holiest man alive.” Days later, Assemblies of God leaders addressed the issue of sex abuse in the denomination during a biennial gathering in Orlando, defending their handling of the Savala case while also pledging to make changes to prevent similar abuses in the future. The men alleged that when they were in their teens, Pinkerton would give them massages and rub their penises; several said Pinkerton would greet them with what he referred to as a “heavenly kiss” or “brotherly kiss” on the lips, likening this to Jesus. Assemblies of God officials distanced themselves from Pinkerton on Monday, telling NBC News that, although Pinkerton worked at an Assemblies of God church, he was never formally credentialed as a minister with the denomination. “We are so saddened to hear of this report, and are deeply concerned whenever reports like this come out,” said Benjamin Rainey Jr., secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God regional office that oversees the three-state region that includes Maryland. In a statement posted last week on its website, Central Christian said Pinkerton served on its staff more than 15 years ago and hasn’t been affiliated with the church since he left to start his own ministry. In the years since the alleged abuse occurred, Pinkerton has preached in at least six different states, NBC News found, and according to his ministry website, he has evangelized in South America, Europe and Asia. One church where he preached, the New Chapel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is not an Assemblies of God church, posted on its website over the weekend that it had cut ties with Pinkerton before he was arrested. “We were heartbroken to hear of these serious allegations that occurred in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 20 years ago, and communicated the situation to our church family after severing all ties with the accused several months back.

Meanwhile, the national drought group - which includes the Met Office, regulators, the government, and water companies - has warned that England is now suffering from "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The group said England is experiencing widespread environmental and agricultural effects from the shortage of water, which is hitting crop yields, reducing feed for livestock, damaging river wildlife and wetlands, as well as increasing wildfires. A jet stream to the north and high pressure to the east is drawing up hot and humid air from the south As high pressure has pushed eastwards, the UK has been drawing in some very warm air on a southerly to south easterly wind from the European continent, where temperatures have been particularly high.

Article: The reconciliation bill President Donald Trump signed last month increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention budget by more than 300%, making the immigration enforcement machine’s budget comparable to that of some foreign armed forces. ICE has begun hiring thousands of new agents; it is trying to lure recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, and last week Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires. The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy. As we at the American Immigration Council laid out in a recent report, Trump’s second-term immigration policies, in just six months, represent an unprecedented and coordinated assault on democratic rights and principles. And despite the Fifth Amendment’s promise of due process, the administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s hellhole CECOT prison, based on vague, unchallengeable allegations of gang affiliation. In addition to hiring thousands of new ICE agents, the federal government is rapidly expanding detention capacity, filling private jails and converted military sites with thousands of people, most of whom have never been charged with a crime. In immigrant-heavy communities, people are afraid to report real crime — like in Tennessee, where, according to a police chief, a child may have died because their noncitizen caretaker was scared to call 911 given the recent immigration raids in the state.

She gave out fliers saying, “Allah is a Gay God” in a Muslim neighborhood in England, popularized the idea that there’s a white genocide in South Africa and interviewed the reactionary philosopher Alexander Dugin on a trip to Moscow seemingly arranged by shadowy Russian interests. “A victim.” After her encounter with Tate, she wrote, her life “unraveled.” She yearned to escape her own infamy and the need to keep shoveling more outrageous content into the internet’s insatiable maw. She posted photos of herself baking, and “selfies in the mirror showing how quickly I had bounced back to fitness and health after pregnancy.” But in reality, she wrote, her life was “hell.” She’d moved with her husband from Canada, where she’d grown up, to his native Australia, where she lived in near-total isolation.

Article: A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit established by Congress to bolster democracy worldwide that had been paralyzed by the loss of funding earlier this year. Friedrich of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in her 15-page ruling that the Trump administration had withheld funds from the nonprofit “for impermissible policy reasons,” and that the endowment had suffered irreparable harm in the form of layoffs of critical staff members and suspension of several democracy-supporting initiatives. “These harms to the endowment’s global reputation and to the ‘very existence of its programs’ are irreparable,” Judge Friedrich wrote, ordering the release of $95 million in federal funds to the nonprofit — roughly 30 percent of its annual budget. The endowment, which has been denounced by major authoritarian powers like China and Russia, was one of several U.S.-backed human rights groups that fell victim to aggressive cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency, a group led by Elon Musk that sought to slash much of the government soon after President Trump returned to office.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP) WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). “This is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,” Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. “In fact, it’s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.” The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia’s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday.

Article: Bank of America thinks the Federal Reserve may want to hold off on cutting interest rates at the end of its next FOMC meeting in the wake of the latest jobs report. "We think those FOMC members that argue for cuts don't put enough weight on the labor supply shock or the fact that inflation is stuck above target, with risks of a larger and more persistent shock after the latest tariff hikes," economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote on Monday. "Cutting in September may risk starting the easing cycle without evidence that inflation has peaked." He also said that he still doesn't expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. "The downward revision to nonfarm payrolls increases the probability of what we view as the most likely alternate scenario: 'bad cuts,' due to deterioration in the labor market," Irigoyen wrote.

Article: Bill Essayli’s request to dismiss charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who has already been convicted of a felony for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest, ordering him to start his prison sentence this month. Wilson said the government’s effort to overturn a jury conviction was “contrary to the public interest.” The ruling brought to a close a criminal case involving an unusual post-trial plea agreement, which triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May and ultimately saw the felony reduced to a misdemeanor. Advertisement In an 11-page ruling, Wilson cited a lack of new evidence or change in circumstances of the case in denying the motion to in effect erase the prosecution of L.A. But after Essayli, a staunch supporter of President Trump, was named top federal prosecutor for the area in April, he ordered a review of the case and sought its unraveling. Advertisement A federal jury found Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law after he violently threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023. “Indeed, after the Court rejected its request for probation and imposed a custodial sentence, the Government responded by seeking to dismiss all charges — ensuring Defendant serves no time at all.” A spokesman for the U.S. Caree Harper, who has served as a victim’s rights attorney for the woman Kirk was convicted of assaulting, celebrated the ruling as a minor victory in the face of Essayli’s broader assault on the case. Late last month, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the judgment against Kirk, citing “misgivings about the case.” They also moved to drop charges in another controversial criminal case, involving Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains. The motions to dismiss came the same day that the Trump administration moved to extend Essayli’s term as L.A.’s top federal law enforcement official, despite flouting the normal confirmation process for prosecutorial appointees. “There’s nothing left.” Essayli’s decision to offer the deputy a lenient postconviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections. Faerstein told jurors Kirk used excessive force against Houseton by slamming her to the ground and pepper-spraying her “when it was unnecessary to do so.” Kirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded. In handing down the four-month sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury’s view, Kirk’s actions were “just plain inexplicable.” He said that Kirk “knew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,” before he pepper-sprayed Houseton. Keenan told the judge that the office found no new evidence but argued not enough attention had been paid to “acts of resistance.” “Didn’t the jury see all that?” Wilson questioned. The jury saw all of it.” After the hearing last week, activists confronted Keenan in the hallway, telling him “this is bigger than Kirk.” Among them was Raycine Ector, the lead organizer of Cancel the Contract Antelope Valley, a community coalition advocating for ending contracts between the Sheriff’s Department and local cities and schools.

Article: The law, Senate Bill 37, is part of a broader effort by Republican lawmakers to assert more control over public universities following years of clashes with faculty over issues like tenure, diversity initiatives and academic freedom. Other university systems, including Texas A&M, University of Houston and University of North Texas, are taking steps to preserve their faculty senates and avoid a gap in faculty representation by restructuring them ahead of the Sept. The University of Houston System said it began planning for a new faculty council earlier this summer, and its board is scheduled to vote on the updated policies and bylaws in August. The Texas Tech University System has indicated it plans to retain its faculty senates in accordance with the new law, though it’s unclear what steps it has taken in that direction. “It’s a head-scratching moment to wonder how and why the effort looks so different,” said Joseph Velasco, a professor at Sul Ross State University, which is part of the Texas State University System. “It risks breaking the thread of shared governance that keeps the university healthy and accountable.” At Sul Ross, faculty who teach at least six credit hours a semester automatically become members of the faculty assembly, a body that functions like a faculty senate and advises the administration. Faculty senates, which have traditionally elected their own leaders and representatives, will look drastically different under SB 37, even at those universities opting to keep their faculty senates and adapt them to comply with the law. “Continuity matters because a functioning faculty senate serves as a check and balance within the university.” Mark Criley, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said the administration could also use the new faculty senates to make it appear as if they have faculty support when they do not. SB 37 requires faculty senates to broadcast their meetings when a majority of members are present, record attendance on critical votes, and post agendas seven days in advance, a stricter standard than the 72-hour requirement under the Texas Open Meetings Act. The law also allows university administrators to remove faculty senate members for “failing to conduct the member’s responsibilities within the council or senate’s parameters, failing to attend council or senate meetings or engaging in similar misconduct.” The law doesn’t define what qualifies as misconduct. Last year, more than 500 professors at Creighton’s alma mater, UT-Austin, signed a petition calling for the removal of then-President Jay Hartzell over his decision to have law enforcement respond to peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. Coby Condrey, a librarian who serves as chair of the UNT faculty senate, said that he expects to continue that strategy under SB 37, and that UNT’s administration will respond in kind. He anticipates the UNT System’s board of regents will authorize faculty senates at their meeting later this month, and said UNT President Harrison Keller has already agreed to consider faculty recommendations when selecting appointees. “We know that it is always going to be better for the faculty to have the administration at least hear our concerns, even if not all of the decisions might be the ones that we would prefer,” Condrey said. Disclosure: Southern Methodist University, Sul Ross University, Texas State University System, Texas Tech University System, University of Houston, University of North Texas, University of Texas System and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: What we learnt from Nicola Sturgeon's memoir 26 minutes ago Share Save James Cook • @BBCJamesCook Scotland editor Share Save BBC Nicola Sturgeon's memoir Frankly is now on sale, slightly earlier than expected after newspaper serialisations and interviews teased some tantalising extracts. Spindrift Isla Bryson was jailed in 2023 after being convicted of rape Sturgeon also addresses the case of double rapist Adam Graham who was initially sent to a female prison after self-identifying as a woman called Isla Bryson. "In football parlance, I lost the dressing room." Speaking to ITV News on Monday Sturgeon said she now believed a rapist "probably forfeits the right" to identify as a woman. JK Rowling JK Rowling posted a selfie of herself wearing a T-shirt describing Sturgeon as a "destroyer of women's rights" The former first minister also criticises her highest profile opponent on the gender issue, Harry Potter author JK Rowling, for posting a selfie in a T-shirt bearing the slogan "Nicola Sturgeon, destroyer of women's rights". Her relationship with Alex Salmond Sturgeon's mentor and predecessor as first minster, Alex Salmond, is mentioned dozens of times in the book, often in unflattering terms which reflect their estrangement after he was accused of sexual offences. Salmond won a judicial review of the Scottish government's handling of complaints against him and in 2020 was cleared of all 13 charges but his reputation was sullied by revelations in court about inappropriate behaviour with female staff. "He impugned the integrity of the institutions at the heart of Scottish democracy," she writes, adding: "He was prepared to traumatise, time and again, the women at the centre of it all". The campaign was tough, she says, partly because of what she calls unbalanced coverage by the British media including the BBC and partly because Salmond left her to do much of the heavy lifting. PA Media Sturgeon claims Alex Salmond showed little interest in the "detail" of the independence white paper A key period in the lead-up to the poll was her preparation, as deputy first minister, of a white paper setting out the case for independence. Getty Images Sturgeon described her house as looking like a murder scene Text here Leading Scotland during the pandemic For Sturgeon, the coronavirus pandemic which struck the world five years ago still provokes "a torrent of emotion". She says she will be haunted forever by the thought that going into lockdown earlier could have saved more lives and, in January 2024, after she wept while giving evidence to the UK Covid inquiry, she "came perilously close to a breakdown". PA Media Nicola Sturgeon appeared visibly upset when giving evidence to the Covid Inquiry Text here Misogyny and sexism Scathing comments about the inappropriate behaviour of men are scattered throughout the book. "Like all women, since the dawn of time, I have faced misogyny and sexism so endemic that I didn't always recognize it as such," Sturgeon writes on the very first page. Sturgeon says a male MSP from a rival party taunted her with the nickname "gnasher" as he spread a false rumour that she had injured a boyfriend during oral sex. Nicola Sturgeon says she may have appeared to be a confident and combative leader but underneath she is a "painfully shy" introvert who has "always struggled to believe in herself." She writes in detail about the "excruciating pain" and heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage after becoming pregnant at the age of 40. Sturgeon touches on the end of her marriage, saying "I love him" but the strain of the past couple of years was "impossible to bear." She also writes about her experience of the menopause, explaining that "one of my deepest anxieties was that I would suddenly forget my words midway through an answer" at First Minister's Question Time.

The Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) spokesperson said the institute "is an independent organisation and has been consulting on changes to refocus its work under its Turing 2.0 strategy". "The changes set out in his letter would do exactly that, giving the Institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be," they said. Any shift to focusing on defence would be a significant pivot for the publicly funded organisation, which was given a grant of £100m by the previous Conservative government last year. The Turing Institute told the BBC it was undertaking "substantial organisational change to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK's national institute for data science and AI". A Charity Commission spokesperson said: "We are currently assessing concerns raised about the Alan Turing Institute to determine any regulatory role for us." They said it is in the early stages of this assessment and has not decided whether to launch a formal legal investigation. Warning of a risk to funding, the complaint said the Turing Institute's "ongoing delivery failures, governance instability and lack of transparency have triggered serious concerns among its public and private funders".

The Ukrainian leader’s warnings come in advance of Trump’s scheduled meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, and after the US president said that Kyiv would have to cede land to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, a proposition that Ukraine has firmly rejected. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also said on Monday that a peace deal for Ukraine must involve Kyiv and not be imposed upon it. US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which monitors the conflict in Ukraine on a daily basis, said in a recent report that Moscow does not appear to be preparing the Russian public for accepting “a settlement short of a full victory in Ukraine”. European leaders and Zelenskyy plan to speak with Trump in advance of his meeting with Putin as fears mount that Washington may dictate unfavourable peace terms to Ukraine after the Alaska summit.

Article: The bot, which has become widely embraced on X as a way for users to fact-check or respond to other users’ arguments, posted that it had been taken offline over various statements it made regarding U.S and global politics, ranging from claims of genocide in Gaza to discussions about homicide rates by race. At the time, the Grok account acknowledged the posts and said xAI “has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” In a statement posted on Grok’s X account later that month, the company apologized “for the horrific behavior that many experienced.” “Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users,” the statement read. This is independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok.” In May, Grok was involved in another controversy when it brought up South African “white genocide” claims as responses to unconnected inquires. When users asked why Grok was issuing such responses, the chatbot said its “creators at xAI” instructed it to “address the topic of ‘white genocide’ specifically in the context of South Africa and the ‘kill the Boer’ chant, as they viewed it as racially motivated,” according to The Guardian. Grok also acknowledged the glitch, writing that it will "focus on relevant, verified information going forward.” Even with its troubles, Grok has become one of the most public and recognizable AI chatbots due to its integration within X, where it has become a go-to for people looking for context, information and fact-checking. In a series of responses Monday after it came back online, Grok repeatedly stated without prompting that its “account was suspended after I stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza.” The posts have since been removed.

Article: Just hours after President Donald Trump said he would deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C., a federal judge in San Francisco heard arguments Monday about whether the administration violated federal law when it mobilized troops to Los Angeles this summer. Gavin Newsom and to stop using the military “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law.” The federal government is arguing that the deployment of the National Guard and Marines was solely to support immigration officials, who were impeded by large-scale protests across the city in early June. In response, the Department of Defense ordered some 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as thousands of immigration activists and supporters marched in the streets and outside federal buildings to show their opposition to Trump's mass deportation effort. The state sued the Trump administration for what it called an unwarranted deployment and won an early victory from Breyer, who found the federal government had violated the 10th Amendment clarifying the balance of power between federal and state governments. The case, which is expected to continue through Wednesday, could set a precedent for how the Trump administration handles future deployments of federal troops in D.C., Baltimore and other cities led by Democratic mayors. (Newsom and Bass are Democrats.) “The factual question, which the court must address, is whether the military was used to enforce domestic law, and if so, whether there continues to be a threat that will be done again,” Breyer told the court. Harrington, who did not participate in or witness work in the field, said he raised concerns about the Posse Comitatus Act on June 7 during a task force briefing before federal forces arrived in Los Angeles. During questioning by state Deputy Attorney General Jane Reilley, Harrington said he worried that if the California National Guard was deployed, it would lose law enforcement authority because of the statute and be reduced to a supportive role. That was the case when federal forces accompanied immigration agents to separate operations at Los Angeles' MacArthur Park and a cannabis cultivation center in Camarillo, north of L.A., Harrington said. “The soldiers actually did not engage in any activity.” Prior to deploying at MacArthur Park on July 7, when federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out across the mostly empty space, Harrington received an intelligence report that did “not indicate a high-value target or threat to federal functions at this location,” he said. During an immigration enforcement action in Mecca, a desert community about 142 miles east of Los Angeles, approximately 300 task force soldiers were present, compared to 200 federal law enforcement agents, Sherman said. Breyer appeared to bristle on multiple occasions, at one point arguing with both Sherman and DOJ attorneys about whether federal forces can intervene any time people protest a law they dislike. Ernesto Santacruz Jr., field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, testified that federal intervention was necessary because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd of 1,500 gathered outside the federal building on June 6 to protest immigration arrests. “That impacted our ability to conduct our missions.” Lawyers with the DOJ asked Breyer for a quick judgment at the end of the day, arguing that the state had failed to make its case.

Article: NEW YORK — AriZona Iced Tea's legendary 99-cent price tag may finally face its end after nearly three decades, as company leadership grapples with the financial impact of new aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Don Vultaggio, the founder and chairman of AriZona Beverage Company, told The New York Times he is reluctantly considering raising prices on the company's signature tallboy cans for the first time since 1997, when the iconic 99-cent price was established. Just over a year ago, Vultaggio affirmed his commitment to keeping the price at 99 cents for "the foreseeable future." "I hate even the thought of it," Vultaggio told The Times. "It would be a hell of a shame after 30-plus years." The potential price increase stems from the Trump administration's 50% tariff on aluminum imports from Canada, according to The Times. About 80% of the aluminum AriZona uses comes from recycled material produced in the United States, while the remainder is imported from Canada and now subject to the 50% import duty, The Times reported. Vultaggio told The Times that aluminum prices have been "dramatically bumped up because of this tariff talk," and he expects domestic aluminum manufacturers to raise their prices in response to the tariffs. The 73-year-old founder, whose childhood in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood shaped his approach to affordability, established AriZona's business model around three simple principles: make it taste good, make it look good and price it right. Vultaggio expressed hope to The Times that the tariff dispute will be resolved, but acknowledged that "at some point the consumer is going to have to pay the price" if it is not.

Article: “I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said during the conference in which he was joined by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the city’s police force while it is under federal control. “Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I’m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act… and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,” he said. “And nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.” According to a report by the news outlet Politico, federal law enforcement officers will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and national monuments. The “rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government”, the order states. “The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.” It also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president “on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia”.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has tapped an economist from a conservative think tank to lead a key statistics agency after firing its previous head over her role in the release of weak employment figures. Trump’s nomination of Antoni, who requires confirmation by the US Senate, comes after his firing of Erika McEntarfer earlier this month raised concerns about US government statistics remaining credible and free of political influence. Trump justified McEntarfer’s dismissal by claiming, without evidence, that the latest jobs report, which showed sharply slower jobs growth for May and June than previously estimated, had been “rigged” to make him look bad. After Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with Japan last month, Antoni described the agreement as “darn close” to perfect and the US president and his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, as “artistic masters”. Last week, Antoni said in a social media post that there were “better ways to collect, process, and disseminate” economic data, and that the next head of the BLS would need to deliver “accurate data in a timely manner” to rebuild trust in the agency.

Article: You feel much safer.” Snider is among a half-dozen policing and military experts who told NBC News they were perplexed by President Donald Trump’s unprecedented decision to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and order the National Guard to help fight crime in Washington, D.C. as a crime-infested hellscape and said Attorney General Pam Bondi would “take command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.” In making his case, Trump ticked off recent violent incidents in Washington, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern and the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, an original Department of Government Efficiency staffer known online as "Big Balls." “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people,” Trump said. President Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, from left, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from right, during a news conference to discuss crime in Washington, DC, in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, on Monday. “However, we emphasize that federal intervention must be a temporary measure, with the ultimate goal of empowering a fully staffed and supported MPD to protect our city effectively.” Concern from former chiefs The announcement of the federal takeover was met with alarm by Art Acevedo, a retired police chief who led departments in Houston, Austin and Miami. “There’s no reason for it other than the political optics sought by the administration to pretend that crime is out of control and they are the saviors.” Trump said that he had appointed the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the head of the Metropolitan Police Department. At her own press conference later in the day, Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions “unsettling and unprecedented.” The attorney general of D.C., Brian Schwab, had also blasted the move and said that he was exploring legal options, but Bowser acknowledged that Trump had the authority to temporarily seize control of the police department. She noted, however, that “nothing about our organizational chart has changed.” Trump must notify certain members of Congress within 48 hours about the reason for taking over control of police and the estimated timeline for federal control, according to the D.C. They know where the violence occurs,” said Snider, who is an adjunct lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a policy director of criminal justice and civil liberties at the R Street Institute, a think tank in D.C. Daniel Hodges, one of dozens of Metropolitan Police Department officers who were brutalized during the riot and whose assailants were among those pardoned by Trump upon his return to office, woke up to the news that Trump had taken over the MPD after working an overnight shift.

Article: But based on what we know so far, the efforts would fail to address the real problems with the flow of aid into Gaza — and could provide political cover for Israel as it carries on with its assault on civilian life in the territory. Huckabee also said the sites would operate for longer periods of time; while sites in some cases have opened for mere minutes before announcing they’re out of food, Huckabee said that in the future they could operate for “as much as 24 hours a day.” This would be an incremental improvement, but akin to placing a Band-Aid on a gaping wound — while also stabbing the patient elsewhere. It reduced primary distribution of food to just four sites, and three out of its four initial sites are in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, making it hard for much of the population to access food. As I explained in a recent piece, GHF sites create a horrifying dilemma for Gazans by forcing them to choose between starving or risking being shot: Close to a thousand people have been shot and killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations. official to describe the new system.) Humanitarian and famine experts say that the program can’t possibly feed everyone in the territory and that it also ‘humiliates and undermines’ the population. But The New York Times, citing two senior Israeli military officials and two other Israelis involved in the matter, reported in July that “the Israeli military never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations” and that the U.N. (A White House spokesperson claimed no State Department official had seen the study and said it “was likely produced by a deep state operative.”) What we do know is that a surge in starvation-related deaths in Gaza came after Israel paused aid and instituted the GHF. Last week, Huckabee visited the Gaza Strip alongside Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and called GHF’s operations an “incredible feat.” Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News, “It was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military.” (NBC News also reported that “on the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid.”) The Trump administration is clearly willing to airbrush and downplay the harsh realities on the ground, which should give us reason to doubt that it’ll hold a high bar when trying to allow more food into the enclave. If the Trump administration were serious about helping Gaza, then it would pressure Israel to end a war that hundreds of ex-Israeli security officials have said no longer serves any military purpose against Hamas and call for an end to a blockade that treats civilians as targets of war.

Article: 7 episode of “The Briefing with Jen Psaki.” Here’s a headline you might not have expected from the Los Angeles Times: “ICE arrests plummet in L.A., data show.” Over the past month, immigration arrests in the seven counties around Los Angeles have fallen to about half of what they were the previous month — and experts say there’s a simple reason for that. Last month, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop arresting suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their race, ethnicity, language and the type of work they do — otherwise known as racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security suggested that this raid was targeting MS-13 gang members, but, as the Times noted, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs. Local officials in Los Angeles have said Wednesday’s operation looks a lot like the kind of racial profiling raids that the courts explicitly told ICE they could no longer conduct in Southern California. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, questioned the federal government’s claim that the immigrants targeted in this raid were “gang members” and asked authorities to share any evidence they had to prove so. In a new court filing, they asked the Supreme Court to overturn that judge’s order and let them please go back to profiling as many brown, Spanish-speaking day laborers as they want. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” That is a pretty unbelievable statement.

Article: On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he is ordering the Commerce Department to work on a new census that would exclude “persons who are illegally in our Country illegally.” It’s often difficult to know from a social media post what Trump intends. There, Democratic state legislators have fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum needed to adopt a new congressional map, with the intended effect to tilt the table slightly toward the GOP in what will most likely be a challenging 2026 election environment. And this is before Republican-allied organizations like business and law enforcement groups pressure Republican members of Congress to provide reliable population counts that would be jeopardized by the redirected resources needed to conduct a slap-dash census. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment clearly states that congressional seats are to be apportioned by the “whole number of persons in each State.” Trump’s directive will be litigated, which poses yet another logistical barrier. If I were to guess what would happen, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will order the Census Bureau to explore adding a question to the 2030 census asking for people’s legal status in the country. In this scenario, the legal questions about using the data for apportionment and redistricting would be cans to be kicked down the road until the next president releases the population counts of the 2030 census. Advocacy groups representing immigrant communities would still most likely file lawsuits, though, alleging the addition of the status question negatively affects participation in the decennial census, thereby undermining the federal government’s Fourteenth Amendment mandate.

Article: District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong said the government can’t rely on the following factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence at a particular location, such as a bus stop, day laborer pickup area or agricultural site; or one’s type of work. Approving the factors laid out by Frimpong, the panel observed that apparent Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity has limited relevance in this context, because large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have such physical characteristics, especially in central California. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that “in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.” Sauer complained that immigration agents can’t detain people based on those factors “even after encountering someone who speaks only Spanish and works as a day laborer at a worksite that has been cited 30 times for hiring illegal aliens as day laborers.” As the administration has done throughout President Donald Trump’s second term, Sauer casts the latest litigation as yet another instance of the justices needing to check their lower court colleagues. “When lower courts have tried to stymie other areas of immigration enforcement with unlawful, blunderbuss injunctions, this Court has not hesitated to stay those orders,” he wrote, citing recent examples of the high court siding with the administration (over dissent from Democratic-appointed justices). Against that backdrop, Sauer is pleading with the justices to free the administration from what he called the “straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.” How the court handles the request could indicate whether the justices agree with that dramatic framing, or whether they see that claimed confinement as a consequence of the Constitution rather than defiance of it.

Article: As someone who’s had another person’s kidney filtering my blood for more than five years, I don’t think I’ve been paranoid to worry that a health secretary so openly hostile to 20th-century medical innovations would eventually decide that people living happily after a transplant is a problem that warrants his solution. That’s why it was so frightening to read what Kennedy posted on X Monday: “Under my leadership, [the Department of Health and Human Services] is overhauling the organ transplant system,” he wrote. “We’ve exposed gross negligence, launched sweeping reforms, and will decertify any organization that violates the sanctity of human life.” Kennedy’s post and the news interviews and press release that preceded it focus on a horrible scandal involving Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates (which, after a merger, is now called Network for Hope) that was exposed last year. Over a four-year period, according to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, more than five dozen people who were on life support and not expected to recover nearly had their organs removed while they were still alive. The newspaper, quoting his medical records, said that as a medical team was preparing Hoover for organ retrieval in 2021, “he cried, pulled his knees to his chest and shook his head.” The newspaper said two former employees of the procurement organization said higher-ups in their organization pressured the doctor to proceed with the retrieval but that the doctor refused. “Network for Hope looks forward to working collaboratively with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and encourages the development of policies that support the betterment of the organ transplant system as a whole.” That same day, after a congressional hearing on organ procurement agencies, Massa released another statement: “We hold ourselves to the highest standards and are committed to ongoing improvement as we carry out the sacred responsibility of honoring each individual’s decision to become an organ donor.” The allegation that a procurement agency would push a doctor to remove organs from someone who was still viable is the stuff of nightmares. A press release issued by his office at the end of July calls out the offenses of “a major organ procurement organization” but doesn’t immediately point out that the scandal was specific to Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates. The first response I saw to Kennedy’s X post suggests that all such organs are improperly removed, that there are no cadaverous donors and that all organs come from people who are alive but medically immobilized. That’s absurd, but it’s no more absurd than Kennedy’s assertion that Black people’s immune systems are so strong we should be on a different vaccine schedule, his insistence that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS or his argument that Covid was “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and spare Jews and Chinese people.

Article: A shooting outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Atlanta headquarters on Friday left a police officer dead and officials and scientists at the nation’s premier public health agency shaken. Citing a senior law enforcement official, The New York Times reported the shooter, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was fixated on the Covid vaccine, which he blamed for his health problems. In response to the shooting and reports of White’s motivations, newly appointed CDC Director Susan Monarez convened an online all-hands meeting of the agency division that focuses on vaccines — the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It is not fair to all of you who’ve given so much to contribute to public health,” Monarez told employees during the meeting Saturday, according to a recording reviewed by MSNBC. One said they felt like “sitting ducks.” As the leaders spoke, dozens of staffers posted messages in the meeting chat, many naming Kennedy, who oversees the CDC at the Department of Health and Human Services, citing his years of spreading misinformation about vaccines and vilifying the health agencies he now leads. One employee described the shooting as “the culmination of ongoing animosity toward CDC and the work that we do — not a one-off incident.” Another named Kennedy in a comment that drew dozens of supportive emoji reactions, writing: “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation. In videos from anti-vaccine conferences between 2013 and 2019, he likened the agency’s vaccine work to “fascism” and “child abuse,” called it a “cesspool of corruption” and said it was filled with profiteers. At a 2013 conference, when asked about why the CDC had failed to acknowledge the autism epidemic (which he falsely linked to vaccines), Kennedy said it was like the Holocaust. During the pandemic, Kennedy repeatedly framed the CDC and other HHS agencies as “corrupt,” falsely suggested Covid-19 was a “bioweapon,” and lied about the dangers of Covid vaccines, calling them “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” “The hatred RFK and his allies have spent their lives stoking puts a target on the backs of anyone in public health,” said one senior official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the agency and so they could speak critically about Kennedy. Monarez called it “a good question” and said the CDC had been in “constant communication” with his office and that “more will be coming.” Kennedy did post a message of support to the CDC from his HHS account shortly after the meeting. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.” The shooting marks a low point in an already dark period for public health.

Article: (CNN) Dominion Voting Systems had two goals in its defamation case against Fox News — accountability and “trying to make Dominion whole,” said Justin Nelson, the lead counsel election technology company. The payment of more than $787 million by Fox News to Dominion and the network’s statement acknowledging that its coverage of the 2020 election was false was “a strong message of accountability” and an important victory for the employees of his client’s company. “And what today has shown is that you have to pay a price if you’re telling lies.” Previous court filings revealed messages that showed that the most prominent stars and highest-ranking executives at Fox News privately ridiculed claims of election fraud in the 2020 election, despite the right-wing channel allowing lies about the presidential contest to be promoted on its air. “It’s a lot of what we teach our kids, which is that the truth does indeed matter, and if you are lying, eventually there’s going to be consequences to that,” Nelson said.

Article: CNN — For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation. According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets. The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company. The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.” At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.” Broadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020. Key false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said. “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.” Broadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs Lou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.” “Yes. Key false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said. Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’” Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion. Broadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani Statements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Key false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said. Broadcast 10: Dobbs interviews Powell Fox Business host Lou Dobbs conducts a phone interview with pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell during the November 19, 2020, edition of "Lou Dobbs Tonight." Fox News/court filings The broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020. Key false quote: “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said. Key false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said. Key false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said. “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said. “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated. We have tremendous evidence already … of fraud in this election, but I will be glad to put forward on this broadcast whatever evidence you have, and we’ll be glad to do it immediately.” Broadcast 18: Tweet from Dobbs The broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded video of Powell interview on December 10, 2020. Key false quote: “We have a machine, the Dominion machine, that’s as filled with holes as Swiss cheese and was developed to steal elections, and being used in the states that are involved,” Giuliani said.

Article: Wilmington, Delaware CNN — Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility. Attorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.” The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud. Fox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.” These revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Fox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms. Dramatic days in Delaware Speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.” Many on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court. While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election.

Article: CNN — Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans. The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.” It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.” McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. We’ll get together and work through it.” His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. “I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?” Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake. “There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”

Article: CNN — The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said. Andrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd. The criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.” But questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting. He was able to go back home that evening.” Lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.” The shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense. On the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN. “Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.” The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. “We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said. “That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.” How the shooting unfolded Before the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement. Susan Pfannmuller/AP Police spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace. When he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says. The teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.” ‘You can’t profile and shoot our children’ Ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.” Ralph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page. “The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said. The conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.

Article: CNN — A 13-year-old in Ohio has died after “he took a bunch of Benadryl,” trying a dangerous TikTok challenge that’s circulating online, according to a CNN affiliate and a GoFundMe account from his family. Overdosing on Benadryl can result in “serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,” the US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2020 warning to the public about the deadly “Benadryl Challenge” on TikTok. 17 minutes in, this is what we saw CNN Business 07:18 Jacob’s grandmother is doing anything she can “to make sure another child doesn’t go through” with the challenge, she told CNN affiliate WSYX. Our team of 40,000 safety professionals works to remove violations of our Community Guidelines and we encourage our community to report any content or accounts they’re concerned about.” The maker of Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson, has called the challenge “dangerous.” “We understand that consumers may have heard about an online ‘challenge’ involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine,” the undated online statement reads. BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.” “We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.” CNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment. The FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.” Benadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold.

Article: Washington CNN — Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday. Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

Article: CNN — Gobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. djgunner/E+/Getty Images “These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter. Researchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents. Over 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. People in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet. Colombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.

Article: CNN — At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found. “This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.” Nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found. Wide range of abuse Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975. In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools. Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study. On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis. In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found. Dangers of misuse The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.” What parents and caregivers can do The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.” Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.” Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.

Article: CNN — Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.” “I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.” “The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. Even as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.” Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act. “The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures. Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow. Republicans defend Thomas and say SCOTUS can address ethics internally Other Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.” This is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.” “Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen.

Article: The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine, and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy sent to Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy firm Rosatom last month. In the letter, which was reviewed by CNN and is dated March 17, 2023, the director of the Energy Department’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government.” Goods, software and technology are subject to US export controls when it is possible for them to be used in a way that undermines US national security interests. The Energy Department letter comes as Russian forces continue to control the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe and sits in a part of the Zaporizhzhia region that Russia occupied after its invasion of Ukraine last February. “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorized persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities,” the letter says, “such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and willfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorize others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorized recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.” It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.” Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated October 24, 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use in the Zaporizhzhia plant and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorization to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity.” The Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been public about the US’ support for the plant, and stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.

Article: CNN — Two Russian men who claim to be former Wagner Group commanders have told a human rights activist that they killed children and civilians during their time in Ukraine. In the video interviews posted online, former Russian convicts Azamat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev – who were both pardoned by Russian presidential decrees last year, according to Gulagu.net – described their actions in Ukraine, during Russia’s invasion. CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022. Uldarov said in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Soledar and Bakhmut – which have seen some of the fiercest fighting – Wagner mercenaries “were given the command to annihilate everyone.” “There is a superior over all the commanders – it’s Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone get out of there and annihilate everyone,” he added. At one point in the interview, Savichev described how they “got the order to execute any men who were 15 years or older.” He also talked about getting orders to ‘sweep’ a house. “I can say the following: if at least one of these accusations against me is confirmed, I am ready to be held accountable according to any laws.” But Prigozhin said that “if none is confirmed, I will send a list of 30-40 people who are spitting at me like Osechkin (there is a whole list of them, including the scum that fled Russia) that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine is obligated to hand over to me for a ‘fair trial,’ so to speak.” “They will not be “civilians” for us, and especially not children, whom we have never touched and do not touch. These people (spreading the lies) are our enemies, and we will deal with them in a special way.” Earlier, Prigozhin said on Telegram: “Regarding the execution of children, of course, no one ever shoots civilians or children, absolutely no one needs this. We came there to save them from the regime they were under.” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a tweet Monday that the group must be held accountable. In February, CNN spoke to two former Wagner fighters who described how recruited Wagner convicts are pushed to the front lines in a human wave, reminiscent of World War I charges. The US Department of State concurrently announced a number of sanctions meant to “target a range of Wagner’s key infrastructure – including an aviation firm used by Wagner, a Wagner propaganda organization, and Wagner front companies,” according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Article: Senate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly. Democrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success. Feinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.” She recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.” Cardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein. The Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns. Democrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor. Asked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.” “Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol. Feinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary. But Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.” Asked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.” This story has been updated with additional information.

Article: CNN — The governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists. The recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported. In the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.” Jennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News. “For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement. The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.” “Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered.

Children ages 6 months through 5 years who have not yet been vaccinated may now receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine as their primary series, or a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine if they are 6 months through 4 years of age. Children ages 6 months through 5 years who got started on their monovalent vaccines, can now get a dose of a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses they qualify for will depend on the number of doses they’ve already had and what kind of vaccine they got. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported early data showing that the effectiveness of the bivalent vaccines, even against emergency room visits and hospitalizations, has already started to wane. For everyone not covered by today’s changes, the FDA says it intends to make decisions about future vaccinations after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition from its advisory committee in June.

A massive winter storm started the service problems during the holiday season, but Southwest had a much tougher time recovering because of an antiquated crew scheduling system that was quickly overwhelmed, leaving the airline unable to get the staffing it needed to locations to operate flights. Part of what created worse problems at Southwest than at other airlines is that crew members had to call in to the airline, rather than notify it electronically, to let them it of their availability.

That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.” The 25-year-old has been at the Bills’ practice facility in Orchard Park, New York, participating in voluntary offseason workouts this week, according to the team. “He’s here.” Hamlin said he was blessed to have a wonderful medical staff who “treat me with the care of their children.” The safety said his heart is still in the game and he was announcing his comeback to the NFL. I want to stand for that.” Beane said that Hamlin had seen three separate specialists over the offseason, who all agreed that the player “is clear to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.” “(Hamlin’s) in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” Beane added. “We’ll provide all of the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint so just happy for him that he’s been able to check some of those boxes to this point and we’re moving forward taking it one day at a time.” According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, if no underlying cardiac abnormalities are discovered through testing, athletes who have been resuscitated from commotio cordis may return to playing.

Article: CNN — The top US Navy admiral ardently defended a non-binary sailor on Tuesday amid some criticism from Republican lawmakers, saying he is “particularly proud of this sailor.” The sailor, LTJG Audrey Knutson, had their story shared on the Navy’s Instagram page last week. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, tweeted a portion of the clip with the caption, “While China prepares for war, this is what they have our US Navy focused on.” On Tuesday, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, continued attacking the video, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee he had “a lot of problems with the video.” But Chief of Naval Operations Adm. “So, her grandfather served during World War II, and he was gay and he was ostracized in the very institution that she not only joined and is proud to be a part of, but she volunteered to deploy on Ford and she’ll likely deploy again next month when Ford goes back to sea.” Gilday used female pronouns to refer to Knutson but the Navy told CNN Knutson’s pronouns of choice are non-binary. “We ask people from all over the country, from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds to join us,” Gilday said, “and then it’s the job of a commanding officer to build a cohesive warfighting team that’s going to follow the law, and the law requires that we be able to conduct prompt, sustained operations at sea. That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.” Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have attacked the military for being too “woke,” claiming it has been one of the causes of the military’s poor recruiting numbers, despite a recent Army survey showing only 5% of potential recruits were concerned about “wokeness.” Last month, Republican Rep. Mills said, “We absolutely 150% can out-pronoun every single one of our adversaries, and China and Russia I’m sure are quaking in their boots over this.” In response, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros said diversity and equal opportunity training have been a part of the military for decades.

Article: CNN — The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said some fake electors for Donald Trump have implicated each other in potential criminal activity and is seeking to disqualify their lawyer, according to a new court filing. The district attorney’s office is requesting that attorney Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow be disqualified from representing a group of 10 Republicans who served as electors for the former president in Georgia – a state Trump lost to President Joe Biden. The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.” It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.” No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.

Article: For the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify. Although Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace. Cars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.” Deserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971. Add to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution. David Boe/AP “Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.” Sherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail. Scott Sherin, CCO of Alstom's US division “We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.” Only Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments. “It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.” Alstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states. Incoming high-speed lines In March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor. The 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027. Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: “As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America’s most skilled workers to get there.” Brightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada. Coupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes. Costing $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion. With California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt. “The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours. “When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.” According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions. Rail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%. The enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.

Article: After the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, Ketch wrote an Op-ed in The New York Times calling for country music stars to let go of the fear of retaliation from their fanbase, and to break their silence on the gun debate. Audie talks with Ketch about what it’s like to be a musician and a parent in Nashville right now and what he thinks country musicians can do to help prevent another mass shooting. So when First Lady Jill Biden visited the city to attend a vigil for the shooting victims of the Covenant School, it was an absolute given that a country music artist would be there. When a country singer gets off the road, chances are at 8:00 in the morning on Monday after the big weekend, that guy or gal is in line dropping their kid off at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. Audie Cornish 00:03:14 So getting an emoji like that or getting the obligatory "are you okay" that we all start to send each other now when there's a shooting, especially at a school, you're saying it it hits you in a place of what? Audie Cornish 00:06:59 I guess I want to start maybe with Wagon Wheel, because if people go to look you up, that might be the first song they learn about. I wrote it when I was about 17, going to school up in New England in a prep school called Exeter, and I was had just learned to play the banjo up there. Hey mama rock me Audie Cornish 00:07:46 You talk about the idea that your best known song, Wagon Wheel, is often blasting out of a truck, so to speak, that has an NRA sticker. Ketch Secor 00:08:05 When you make the kind of music that I make with a fiddle and a banjo and harmony singing and a particular style of songwriting, you're engaging in a community that might be different than your own sort of background, and it's not. Audie Cornish 00:08:50 And when you're around Nashville and you have political conversations, wherever the person falls on the spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this is The South. And whether it's supposed to be that way or, you know, I think we're in a state of considerable growth down south, but the vestiges remain, and they're important to talk about in this regard, because one of the vestiges is gun culture, and it's largely considered like the rebel flag in the past, just something that exists here. Ketch Secor 00:11:15 Well, I didn't know to go into this, but but I'm excited that we are, Audie, because, you know, country music really especially, and to clarify, contemporary country music on the radio is a real safe space for us to not talk about political divisiveness and not talk about things of of substance. So this sort of, you know, hallmark kind of these ideals that are tossed around might not be that realistic for today's reality of, you know, I worked I'm part of a global economy working two jobs. Instead, they are allowed to say, I taught my child how to, you know, I mean, when I was a kid in the eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned how to fire a weapon. So this is my way of saying it's not over and it won't be over until those deaths, those three deaths of American children gunned down in the third grade, until they mean something, that's when it'll be over. If in all these states and it's not just Tennessee, you've got these blue cities, these little blue dots in a sea of red, and by red I mean very conservative, very pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment legislatures. And and when Nashville in the early 1960s, in the late 1950s said its first foot forward, this was the proving ground, other parts of the South were too unsafe. You know, 50 years from now I think we're going to be looking back at these couple of years as the deciding time for a assault weapons ban in the United States. Audie Cornish 00:18:59 Again, I want to bring it to the question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones who given what we know about the music, number one, have been socially punished for activism by what we call Music Row, by music radio, by country music radio in particular, which still has a very kind of strong grip in a way programmers do, and even recent history. Ketch Secor 00:20:20 Hey, I'm just reaching out to all my Nashville music community in the wake of the shooting and sharing this story that I wrote that came out today in The Times. And when you look at the the roster, who's on the marquee, it's not the usual Americana folks who always say, you know, we stand with kids, we stand up against gun violence. Ketch Secor 00:22:34 There's nothing but up here because we we have started at the very baseline where music coming out of Nashville on the radio says nothing about violence against children in our schools or about the need to rethink the types of weaponry that is associated with the Second Amendment. You know, generally, just like I'm in a songwriting mood here, I'm in a a moment in time with a lot of different opportunities as a writer to engage on this, whether it's, you know, writing the right caption for a photograph on Instagram or writing an op ed piece for The New York Times or being on this podcast with you, Audie. There's so many ways to choose my words right now and try and have them be resonant for the pain that we're feeling in Nashville, Tennessee and around the country because we are just so tired, parents, that our kids are not safe in their schools. What that means for me as a songwriter is that I also have the chance to write new music about this and to put my money where my mouth is.

Article: (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.) Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic. For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Either way, here are some key things to know: Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include: Interest on your savings Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains) Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle Unemployment income Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account Tips Gambling winnings Income from a rental property you own Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.). Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs from your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments for capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor from your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received. “Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions. Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million. Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more.

Article: Why some undocumented immigrants choose to pay taxes The National Immigration Law Center breaks down a number of reasons why undocumented immigrants pay taxes, including: • It shows they’re complying with federal tax laws. • Tax return records could be used to document work history and presence in the US, steps that may help them be eligible for legal immigration status in the future if lawmakers pass immigration reform. How some pay taxes despite not having Social Security numbers Critics of illegal immigration have long argued that undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are able to do so because they’re using stolen Social Security numbers. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that “most experts believe the vast majority of tax returns filed with ITINs today are filed by undocumented immigrants.” Some noncitizens who legally immigrated to the United States also pay taxes using this method. Immigrant rights advocates are speaking out on social media In recent years, immigrant rights advocates’ posts on Facebook, Twitter and TikTok during tax season have drawn attention to the issue. “Wanna tell me again how I should be deported, contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the 1% wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday?” wrote Sisa, who was a college student in Arizona at the time. Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist-turned-activist who’s turned his struggles as an undocumented immigrant into a platform for advocacy, took a break from finalizing his taxes in 2019 to share his experience on Twitter.

Article: CNN — Tuesday is Tax Day in America, one of the most stressful days of the year, when many taxpayers will finally end their procrastination, file their federal returns, and hope for a refund from the IRS. Abigail Disney Grasstaken, Roo Castro and Rod Coplin Morris Pearl Beatrice Mortiz Tax Day isn’t just a filing deadline — it’s also an annual reminder that the ultra-rich exist in an entirely separate world when it comes to taxes. There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that: Tax all types of income the same for high earners Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income. Tax wealth or unrealized capital gains We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable.

Article: “We Norwegians are usually modest people,” Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, “But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.” When you see this sundial, you'll know you're halfway through. If you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.” While the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle.

Article: Berlin-based Boris Eldagsen won the creative open category at this year’s Sony World Photography Award with his entry “Pseudomnesia: The Electrician.” The eerie black and white image shows two women from different generations – the older woman appearing to hang on to the younger woman from behind. Eldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to “separate competitions for AI-generated images.” Eldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a “cheeky monkey” in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images. They are not.” ‘Not about winning’ Eldagsen told CNN Tuesday: “It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don’t need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.” He said that AI had left many photographers feeling “threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.” Eldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation. “I was just making a test to see if they were aware – like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.” In further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement. ‘Misleading’ claims The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that, during the competition’s exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the “co-creation” of this image using AI. “As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.” The statement said organizers recognize “the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.” “While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,” the World Photography Organisation added.

Article: Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.” "Elder Sex" is Marilyn Minter's full set of images originally shot for a New York Times Magazine story on senior sex and intimacy. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy Marilyn Minter & LGDR A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors’ sex lives. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work. Seeking partners In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.” In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged. I’m not going to fake anything here.’” Changing attitudes Minter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said. Video Ad Feedback Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 - Source: CNN Marilyn Minter unveils steamy 'shower' images 01:51 But the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Though “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows. Marilyn Minter/Courtesy of JBE Books & LGDR She hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.

Article: New York CNN — Few women will be surprised to learn that even when wives earn about the same as their husbands or more, a new Pew Research Center study finds that they still spend more time on housework and child care, while their husbands spend more time on paid work and leisure. Nearly half of Americans (48%) in Pew’s survey said husbands prefer to earn more than their wives, while 13% said men would prefer their wives earn about the same as them. Meanwhile, when it comes to having a family, 77% said that children are better off when both parents focus equally on their job and on taking care of the kids. The Pew study is based on three data sources: earnings data from the US Census’ Current Population Survey; data from the American Time Use Survey and a nationally representative survey of public attitudes among 5,152 US adults conducted in January.

McDonald's USA The improvements were first made to burgers in international markets, the company said, and have already arrived in some US cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas. In 2021, it launched a crispy chicken sandwich to replace previous iterations — a relatively late arrival in the chicken sandwich wars, but one that seems to have resonated with McDonald’s customers. “We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,” thanks to improved burgers and items like the chicken sandwich, said McDonald’s (MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski during a January analyst call.

Article: CNN — Shares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 3% in early trading Monday after a report sparked concerns that its core search engine could lose market share to AI-powered rivals, including Microsoft’s Bing. Last month, Google employees learned that Samsung was weighing making Bing the default search engine on its devices instead of Google’s search engine, prompting a “panic” inside the company, according to a report from the New York Times, citing internal messages and documents. (CNN has not reviewed the material.) In an effort to address the heightened competition, Google is said to be developing a new AI-powered search engine called Project “Magi,” according to the Times. The company, which reportedly has about 160 people working on the project, aims to change the way results appear in Google Search and will include an AI chat tool available to answer questions. In a statement sent to CNN, Google spokesperson Lara Levin said the company has been using AI for years to “improve the quality of our results” and “offer entirely new ways to search,” including with a feature rolled out last year that lets users search by combining images and words. “Not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we’ve said before, we’re excited about bringing new AI-powered features to Search, and will share more details soon.” Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In March, Google began opening up access to Bard, its new AI chatbot tool that directly competes with ChatGPT and promises to help users outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge. At an event in February, a Google executive also said the company will bring “the magic of generative AI” directly into its core search product and use artificial intelligence to pave the way for the “next frontier of our information products.” Microsoft, meanwhile, has invested in and partnered with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to deploy similar technology in Bing and other productivity tools. Microsoft’s Bing AI demo was also called out for several errors, including an apparent failure to differentiate between the types of vacuums and even made up information about certain products. In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai stressed the need for companies to “be responsible in each step along the way” as they build and release AI tools. For Google, he said, that means allowing time for “user feedback” and making sure the company “can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.” He also expressed his belief that these AI tools will ultimately have broad impacts on businesses, professions and society.

Article: The best bidets we tested Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Finding the best bidet for your home can make a world of difference. Best bidet attachment: Tushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Attachment Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored If you’re looking for a low-cost bidet that’s simple to set up, effective and not overly complicated, the Tushy Classic 3.0 is the bidet for you. Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushy’s compatibility here and even browse through its searchable list of toilets here. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While I love the Tushy attachment, there’s one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa — and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested — wasn’t effective. Best bidet seat: Toto Washlet C2 Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored While bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience. Beyond being effective, the Toto’s stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or you’re worried a bidet with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the Toto Washlet C5 is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more. Even though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you don’t have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored The Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isn’t much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. Best value bidet seat: Tushy Cloud Bidet Seat Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Tushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features — a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water — for $359. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. Plus, since the Cloud doesn’t have a tank, it doesn’t look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water. The Cloud’s side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesn’t have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use. However, the round version of that bidet can feel a little small, so if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, our old value pick, the Alpha JX2, is probably the best bidet for you. How we tested I’ve conducted multiple rounds of testing and have formally tested 31 bidets over a period of nearly four years to find the best ones on the market. Performance General experience: I noted my overall impressions while using each bidet and what traits stood out the most, whether it was the comfort of the stream, simplicity of controls, ease of setup, etc. Aim/directional spray: I noted how good the aim of each bidet’s spray was and the overall range if it was adjustable and counted how many positions each bidet’s spray had. Number of key features: I counted the number of key features, which were whether the bidet had warm water, whether it had a dryer and whether it had a remote. Think of the Tushy Classic 3.0: You’re not replacing your seat, just putting a thin attachment underneath it (Tushy released two attachments, the Wave and Oasis, which actually replace your seat like an electric bidet. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments don’t have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didn’t get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing. Kai Burkhardt/CNN Underscored Electric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, the Tushy Cloud and one of our previous picks the Alpha JX2, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy. So if you have a one-piece toilet you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidet’s requirements. While it’s a nice upgrade from the Classic, this bidet is missing the ability to adjust the stream’s position — a basic feature I was shocked wasn’t included — and it’s quite pricey. Other bidet seats we tested Alpha Bidet Alpha JX2 Bidet Seat Alpha Bidet This Alpha bidet seat was our previous best value bidet but was dethroned by the Tushy Cloud. Toto Washlet C5 Bidet Seat Toto If you want the remote and user presets of the K300 but don't need the endless warm water, the Toto C5 is the bidet for you. $469 $391 at Amazon This bidet is a slight upgrade from our runner-up bidet seat, the Toto Washlet C2, adding a remote control and the ability to set two user presets. The remote is oriented horizontally, so it isn’t as easy to use with one hand as some other remotes I tried, and the arm of the Cloud has lights so you can see which setting you’re on, which the remote of the Cloud+ does not. The flashiest feature of the Aura is its auto-open lid, which could be useful in a larger bathroom, but whenever I’d walk into mine the sensor would detect movement and it would open. Nova Bidet Eco Nova Bidet Seat Nova Bidet This bidet only comes in elongated versions and wasn't as comfortable to use as other bidets we tested, especially when it came to its dryer. Toto Washlet A2 Elongated Bidet Seat Toto If all you want is a comfortable stream, this Toto bidet is an okay pick, but I think the warm air dryer of the C2 is worth the extra money. $272 $245 at Amazon The most budget-friendly of Toto’s Washlet Bidet Series, the A2 includes many of the great features as the C2 — warm water, dual action spray with oscillator, adjustable water temp and volume settings, heated seat with temperature control and that convenient arm control panel we love. It’s high on comfort and ease of use, but for less than $100 more, the C2 provides warm air drying with three temperature settings, automatic deodorizer, technology that auto-cleans the wand and it also comes in round-front bowl styles. Prime Day Deal Bio Bidet BB-550 Bidet Seat Bio Bidet If you don't want to commit to spending as much for a bidet seat, this is another solid option, but it isn't as feature-filled as the C2. Easy to install once we traded out the toilet supply line hose for a longer, more flexible $10 piece from the hardware store, we like that it comes loaded with features including warm water, an adjustable heated seat, a seat sensor to keep any accidental sprays from happening, a warm air dryer, adjustable water pressure and even a night light. But the controls are located on the sides of the seat, which makes them much less intuitive to use than the Toto Washlet C2 and the Toto’s stream and dryer also prove to be more comfortable. Its spray wasn’t quite as good as Toto’s, and its dryer didn’t cover the wide area that Toto’s did, but it was comfortable, and in general, I enjoyed using this bidet. It does come with a massage function and a deodorizer, but I think the oscillation of the Toto C2 and Alpha JX2 do the job better, and if you want a deodorizer, go with a Toto. It didn’t perform quite as well as the Toto K300, but it has a very comfortable spray and dryer, and its massage function was my favorite stream pattern out of all the bidets I tested. The Bidetmega 400 has more features than the 150 and 200; however, its spray wasn’t as comfortable or effective as other top contenders, even though it automatically goes through a four-stage washing cycle unique to Coway bidets. Editor’s Note: We previously tested the Alpha Bidet iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat, the Alpha Bidet JX and the Coway Bidetmega 200 Electric Bidet Seat, but they have since been discontinued and removed from this article.

Article: While authorities have not yet released a motive for the Friday shooting, CDC Director Susan Monarez, in a call with employees of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), expressed her support for the agency’s mission amid some news reports that the suspect was allegedly fixated on the coronavirus vaccine. “While we pulled you all together today because of my concern for you, the impact of what we were seeing in the media related to this person’s potential motivation, I want to make sure that you understand how supportive I am of you,” Monarez said on the call, according to a partial recording obtained by The Washington Post. “I wanted to address you directly to make sure that you had an opportunity to share your concerns directly.” Advertisement The CDC and other public health institutions have been the subject of intense vitriol following the coronavirus pandemic, as misinformation around vaccines and other pandemic measures swirls. A CDC official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that investigators told the agency it was targeted by the suspect because of the coronavirus vaccine. Investigators said White was found on the second floor of a CVS drugstore at Emory Point, an apartment and retail complex across the street from the CDC Roybal Campus on Clifton Road. DeKalb County interim police chief Greg Padrick said Rose “gave his life with a commitment to serve others.” He is survived by his wife and two children, with another baby expected soon. Advertisement During Monarez’s call with staff Saturday, another CDC senior leader, Daniel Jernigan, who heads the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, or NCEZID, estimated there were about 40 bullet holes in CDC buildings on campus. The shooting was “way worse than what was initially reported,” the employee said, adding that gunfire continued for about 15 minutes and that “it’s a miracle more people weren’t hit.” Most of NCIRD staff work in Building 24, one of the buildings hit by the gunman. During the call with employees Saturday, CDC senior leaders “emphasized that they want campus to feel safe before we come back but I don’t know how that would happen,” another CDC employee said. “ … Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty.” Advertisement Several CDC employees told The Post that the incident had caused fear and anger among some staff. Rather, Nixon said in an email Saturday, “We are restoring trust in vaccines.” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens (D) said Friday that the shooter “is a known person that may have some interest in certain things that I can’t reiterate right now with any confidence until the investigation is fully conducted.” “But I think that in a short order you’ll know more about this individual and about some assumptions of his motives, but can’t say right now,” Dickens told reporters. urging people to “RUN, HIDE, FIGHT.” The CDC sent out their alert via email and text at 5:12 p.m., according to a CDC employee who was in lockdown in one of the buildings hit. “Marty, the girls, and I are thankful for all those who answer the call to serve and who protect their fellow Georgians,” Kemp said, referring to his wife and their children. “We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center.” The GBI, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, said it is coordinating with the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and local police.

Article: Monochronic people “tend to live by the clock and are primed, at least during work hours, to prioritize obligations over relationships.” Polychronic people, on the other hand, “tend to give primacy to experiences and relationships that don’t always fit neatly into prearranged schedules.” If you prefer to work on one thing at a time, emphasizing deadlines and seeing interruptions as irritating, you’re monochronic. While I want to be productive, I want so much more to prioritize relationships over industry, to say “this can wait” when I’m fast at work and someone calls with last-minute theater tickets. My monochronic preference for uninterrupted stretches of time in which to work — oh, the exquisite relief of turning on “Do Not Disturb” on my laptop and knowing that it will also silence my phone, my iPad, the text alerts and weather alerts and news alerts and calendar alerts! I tell myself that nothing will feel as good as getting things done, but then I think of the cliché about people on their deathbeds never saying they wish they’d spent more time working. “If your goal is to complete a task, then we need to be monochronic for a window of time and shut out all distractions.” While switching gears may feel uncomfortable for those of us conditioned to do the thing until the thing is done, this framing highlights the stakes.

Article: Amid the widespread hunger crisis in Gaza, many Palestinians in the enclave have chosen to avoid aid sites and trucks carrying food, fearing they could be trampled or killed by gunfire. That has opened up a black market for obtaining Israeli shekels, the predominant currency, with Palestinians forced to pay exorbitant rates to gain access to their money to feed themselves and their families. At the same time, there has been a huge surge in the price of basic goods since the start of the war, especially in the face of Israeli restrictions on the entry of food into the territory. A 55-pound sack of flour is around $180, two pounds of sugar is about $10, and a similar amount of tomatoes about $20, according to surveys carried out this week by the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce in three cities.

A mature Cape buffalo bull can weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, the company’s website says, cautioning that it is not unusual for buffaloes to charge hunters without provocation and that “no species on the planet has a more fearsome reputation.” The aggressive temperament of the Cape buffalo has earned it a nickname: black death. “Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers,” Hans Vermaak, whose family runs the safari company, said in a statement.

Viewers have adopted a purple sea cucumber as their “little sweet potato,” named a pink lobster Barbie and made art out of a starfish that looks like a character from “SpongeBob.”

Eleanor Olszewski, Canada’s emergency management minister, announced on social media Thursday morning that the armed forces and the Coast Guard would assist the island province of Newfoundland in fighting blazes. About 7.1 million hectares, or 27,000 square miles, of forest have burned so far this season in the country, spreading smoke through parts of Ontario and Quebec, the most populous provinces, and down into the eastern United States, although not with the same intensity as two years ago.

Article: The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a joint declaration at the White House on Friday that would edge their long and frequently bloody conflict closer to resolution — and give President Trump an unusual form of recognition in the process. Trump hosted Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan at the White House on Friday afternoon, where they signed the first such commitment toward a peace deal in decades of conflict. A key part of the breakthrough was an announcement from Armenia giving the United States exclusive development rights to a transit corridor through its territory, connecting Azerbaijan, which sits east of Armenia, to Nakhichevan, a noncontiguous enclave to Armenia’s west that features Azerbaijan’s only border with Turkey, an important ally.

Modi developed such a bonhomie with President Trump in his first term that he broke with protocol to campaign for a second term for him at a stadium-packed event in Houston. Modi’s confidence in India’s increasing alignment with the United States grew after the Biden administration looked past that partisan play to continue expanding relations with India, a bulwark against China. The president singled India out for a whopping 50 percent tariff, citing its purchases of Russian oil, and called India’s economy “dead.” And the president stirred rancor among Indians by giving the leadership of Pakistan — India’s smaller archrival, which Mr.

A spokesman for the White House confirmed that on top of the 40 percent penalty on goods it determines were transshipped, it is “exploring” new rules to apply higher tariffs on components that come from one country, are incorporated into a product in another and then shipped to the United States. “The administration has zero tolerance for transshipment and other methods of undermining our tariffs, and we are working closely with our trading partners to proactively address these concerns,” said the spokesman, Kush Desai.

Article: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism at home and abroad on Friday after his office announced that the Israeli military would escalate its nearly two-year-old campaign in the Gaza Strip by taking control of Gaza City, a move that would probably further endanger Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages and deepen Israel’s international isolation. It laid bare Israel’s isolation as its government decides, against the advice of its military’s top command, to expand a war that has reduced cities to rubble, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused a widespread hunger crisis. “The Israeli Government’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately,” Keir Starmer, the prime minister of Britain, said in a statement.

Article: Despite what Israel says are its efforts to bring more food and other aid into Gaza in recent days, the United Nations and other aid groups say it is falling catastrophically short of what is needed to stop fast-accelerating starvation there. Gaza reached that point after Israel escalated its prior siege of the territory to block virtually all aid from March to May, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages still in Gaza. When Israel allowed aid back in, it did so mostly under a contentious new aid delivery system that resulted in the killings of hundreds of Palestinians and kept all but the strongest and luckiest from getting food. Now Israel is pausing the fighting in some parts of Gaza each day to help aid convoys move, approving some imported food for sale in Gaza and allowing aid to be airdropped.

That followed his announcement on Thursday that Israel would finally defeat Hamas by occupying all of Gaza and then handing it to “Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us.” This latest endeavor, which may take weeks to begin, risks ending the same way as all his previous efforts: in a strategic dead-end, with Hamas still holding on by its fingertips, Israeli hostages still in Hamas’s grip, and Palestinian civilians trapped in a dystopian nightmare. Israel captured much of Gaza City in the first months of war, seizing some areas more than once, before relinquishing it all on the false assumption that Hamas had been defeated.

It is likely to take the military days, at least, to call up reserve forces, carry out troop deployments for a push into Gaza City and allow time for the forced evacuation of tens of thousands of Palestinians from the new areas of combat. Days ago, American and Israeli officials floated the idea of an all-or-nothing deal for Gaza in which all the hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the war would end under certain conditions.

Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled against the administration in a case brought by the Authors Guild, saying that the cancellation of already approved funding for 1,400 research projects violated the First Amendment. In a pointed ruling, Judge Colleen McMahon said that while the administration could focus the agency’s grant making on its own priorities, it did not have the right to “edit history” to exclude perspectives it disliked.

If confirmed by the Senate, Miran would get a key vote on interest-rate policy, putting more pressure on the current Fed chair, Jay Powell, to lower borrowing costs even as concerns grow about the inflationary effects of Trump’s tariffs.

Article: The California Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a lower court to reconsider a state policy that reduced how much utilities have to pay homeowners with rooftop solar panels for the energy that they send to the electric grid. The court did not deem California’s policy illegal but said a State Court of Appeal had erred in affirming the policy without fully reviewing it and by being too deferential to state regulators. The rooftop solar industry and its allies hailed the decision as a big win and said it could open the door to reversing a policy that has sharply reduced the installation of solar panels on California homes over the last two years. “Justice is served, and the sun shines a little brighter on California today,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, senior vice president for California at the Environmental Working Group, one of the parties that challenged the state policy.

Article: The trilogy recounts how a motley group of friends set out on a journey to destroy the great Ring of Power and defeat the dark Lord Sauron, who intends to use its dreadful magic to rule all of Middle-earth through “force and fear.” The Ring corrupts all who use it, and its story endures as a potent allegory about the corrupting effects of greed and pride and what Tolkien called the evil “lust for domination.” Given the trilogy’s idealistic overtones, it’s easy to understand why the books gained a cult following in the 1970s among hippies and Vietnam War protesters, who embraced its love of nature and rejection of consumer culture, and what they saw as its passionate denunciation of militarism and power politics. It’s more difficult to understand why the trilogy’s most prominent fans today are Silicon Valley tech lords like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, and a rising group of far-right politicians in both Europe and the United States. Why do so many of today’s high-profile fans of “The Lord of the Rings” and other fantasy and sci-fi classics insist on turning these cautionary tales into aspirational road maps for mastering the universe? Some of the answers lie in the sheer popularity of the trilogy, which has sold more than 150 million copies across the world and permeated the public imagination, as genre fiction has moved from the margins to the mainstream.

A Swiss maker of precision cutting tools said his company would start layoffs almost immediately for its small American work force of 10 people because it could not afford to absorb the 39 percent tariff, nor pass the whole price increase onto its American manufacturing customers. The dimming prospects for business in the United States also drove the decision, according to the company’s chief executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation by Mr. Officials thought they had made a convincing case to their American counterparts to reduce an initial 31 percent tariff threat by highlighting the major investments that Swiss companies have made in the United States, including by the pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis. Trump’s recent focus has been on wrangling big deals with big economies, announcing agreements with the European Union and Japan that reduced tariffs in exchange for huge investments in the United States and energy purchases from American producers. Image President Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced an agreement last month to lower tariffs on goods from the European Union, to 15 percent. They tried to explain that three-quarters of the trade deficit with the United States was due to gold bullion and bars refined in Swiss foundries, which do not face tariffs.

Article: And this time, I not only passed out, but I vomited and had to be brought back with smelling salts, which — Casey, if you have never experienced smelling salts, they’re not messing around. But it is one of the most amazing, crazy experiences you can have in the human — do you know what I mean, the moment when your consciousness just leaves you? kevin roose And because we are going to talk about OpenAI, I should add my disclosure that The New York Times Company is suing them and Microsoft for copyright violations. So I actually thought it was cool that he said that because now we have one thing to hang on to where well, maybe when a model can do that, we’ll feel like we really are getting close to AGI. But the one other thing that he said that struck me that I thought was kind of funny was that he said that after they had put GPT-5 together, he went back to using GPT-4. So I do think it’s really notable now that even free users, which I think is going to include a lot of high school and college students out there, are now going to have access to what, at least they are saying, is PhD level intelligence and reasoning. But for GPT-5, OpenAI is doing away with the model picker, or at least making it less necessary because they have built this, what they called a router that will essentially analyze your request, and how much computation it needs to be able to answer that request, and whether it’s a simple query or something more involved. And I think for a lot of people, this is going to be their first experience with a reasoning model because OpenAI does not make that the default right now in ChatGPT. On the other hand, I do feel like it sets up an incentive for OpenAI, which wants to save as much money as it can to just always try to route you to the absolute least compute that you need. And so I will just be curious to see if I feel like that is affecting the quality of my experience now that maybe can’t go in and actually say, hey, let me use the good stuff. And that might be a good point to bring up two of the questions that got asked of the GPT-5 team during the briefing that were on the — that I think would be of interest to our listeners. I mean, I wonder if they are starting to finesse their definitions of the scaling laws to account for the new reasoning models because people, for months now, have been saying, well, the models in the pre-training phase may have gotten as good as they’re going to get or about as good as they’re going to get. And all of the labs have had experiences where they thought they were training a new model and then it didn’t quite work out as well as they wanted it to and so they assign it some lower number, that’s happened at least a number of big labs that I know about. To me, that is one of the most interesting things about this release is whatever GPT-5 turns out to be, this is the thing that they thought was the next big step forward. And I think it was reasonable to expect, and I certainly expected that in the wake of all that, they would slow down and maybe allow some competitors to catch up. And I think one thing I’ll have my eye on over the next several months is, are they able to continue iterating very quickly or have some of the losses that they’ve experienced over the past few weeks really hurt them? And I think in particular, if you are a free user of ChatGPT, you’re going to have a great day because for the first time now, in addition to standard ChatGPT model, you’re going to have some reasoning capability. I mean, the way I saw people talking about it online was that they thought that OpenAI had not raised the ceiling of the AI frontier by a lot with GPT-5, but they had raised the floor, essentially. What makes that figure interesting, I think, Kevin, is that that number is a lot smaller than Anthropic’s Claude for Opus API, which comes in at $15 per million input tokens. So I think some of these really well capitalized AI labs are taking this moment to say, hey, we’re going to put a lot of pricing pressure on some of our competitors. In fact, some people are posting online screenshots of some prediction markets that until today, when asked, who do you think will have the most powerful AI model at the end of August, were showing OpenAI in the lead. So I don’t want to overstate what that means necessarily, but it does seem like there was a huge contingent of people who thought that GPT-5 was going to be this revolutionary new model. One of them is that The New York Times Company has recently agreed to a licensing deal with Amazon that will allow Amazon access to “Times” content for its AI platforms, including Alexa. The second thing we should say is that if you have an Alexa device, it is going to be going off constantly during this segment, unless you go over right now and hit the little button that mutes it. And I use zero of them because the three things that I use Alexa for are setting timers, choosing music to play in my house, and telling me the weather before I leave for the day. But when generative AI started to get good a couple years ago, I think people naturally started to ask, well, when is Alexa going to start using this new generative AI technology? But it seemed like a natural thing to expect that Alexa would start to incorporate some of this technology to be able to answer maybe more open-ended questions, to give longer, more detailed responses, to do more than just set timers and tell you the weather. I mean, once OpenAI released voice mode for ChatGPT, it just immediately seemed so much more interesting and powerful than Alexa and Siri, which is Apple’s very similar system that it makes for its devices. And so yeah, I think both of us were like, OK, well, when are we going to get that OpenAI style voice mode in these smart devices that we have in our homes? And part of what I’m so excited to talk with Daniel Rausch, the VP of Alexa, about later in this show, is just why it’s been so hard to shove an LLM-based generative AI technology into this pre-existing assistant product. But we should just talk briefly about what Alexa+ is and then our experiences with it because both you and I have gotten to try this over the past few days. We don’t know exactly which model or models, but it seems to be a mix of Amazon’s proprietary AI models and then maybe some of Claude, which it has a deal with Anthropic. The other big difference I noticed right away is that the new Alexa+ does not require you to say the wake word, like Alexa, between every question and answer pair. And then you can just say, order me an Uber from this place to this place, or I want a table at a restaurant in downtown San Francisco near the Ferry Building for two people at 6:30 tomorrow. And it was just this forever — and so I eventually just unplugged the thing because I was like, why did I just spend $90 to have a permanent rotating advertisement for household products on my desk? Now, there are a lot of things I’m willing to do for a podcast, but mount an Echo Show on my wall — kevin roose You’re not willing to do a construction project. And it’s like, this — and right here, we have just landed in the exact spot that has been bedeviling Apple for the last year, that is bedeviling Alexa right now. And after two days of ads for paper towels and one day of I’m not going to show you the lemon pasta, I thought, what am I doing with my life? kevin roose So the new Alexa+ update seems to have broken Alexa’s ability to reliably set and cancel alarms, which is a core thing that I use this product for. And so for example, this morning, I woke up on my own a little bit earlier than my alarm, like, 10 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off. And one of the things it said was, I can help you explore Gen Z music trends, which there was just something funny about the way it said it to me. But now you’re trying to sell me Amazon Music, which I feel like is very consistent with how Alexa+ handles everything, which is, could we sell you a service right now? Two, I’m very confident that lots of other people are probably having much better experiences with this thing because I think if most people were having experiences as bad as me, I just would have heard about this before now. But I think my overall impression is that the Alexa+ that you have now in this early access program, it is a little like having a kind of GPT-3.5 class model inside of a smart speaker, which I think is a valuable thing and one that I would like them to continue to build on. casey newton I think the most powerful thing that the Alexa+ has done for me is it has made me forgive Apple for not shipping anything with the new Siri. I think what’s happening with Alexa and Siri right now is sort of a — it’s like a symbol of what’s happening in the American economy writ large, which is we are trying to jam these new AI technologies into these legacy systems and processes. I also just think that when I’m using a chatbot on my laptop and it gives me something that’s 80 percent or 85 percent right, that’s much more useful to me than an Alexa response that’s 85 percent right because a chatbot setting, I can just take what I need. But really, it’s a complete re-architecture of everything that you would say Alexa is from the way you have a conversation and engage with the experience at a very basic level all the way through Alexa acknowledging you or just maintaining a chat. I think it’s fair to say we both had some things that impressed us about the new Alexa+ and some things that were challenging, including some of the basic stuff that Alexa seemed to be very good at before, or at least that I know how to get reliable performance out of Alexa for that no longer seem to work as well. Because back in 2023, when Amazon announced that it was going to revamp Alexa, give it this brain upgrade with these new AI capabilities, they said this was going to be ready in 2024. If you go back to 2023 and the models that were available then, the state of the art, very little instruction following reasoning, low ability to execute on these interfaces with other systems, we announced something called Let’s Chat, which was a mode of Alexa. So think about flipping a switch on Alexa and turning on a chat interface so that you can do some basic question and answer and have a discussion about a topic, mostly about knowledge native to the model’s training data versus bringing something in at runtime the way that modern chatbots answer questions by going out on the internet. I think as all of us know, you sit there and fiddle with a chatbot long enough to press it into being smarmy or responding in ways that we don’t believe are the way Alexa might act, for example, or press it to give you wrong information that’s from some unauthoritative source or a mistake in its training data online, shifts back to its native training. Personalizing an experience of this depth so that Alexa is always learning from her interactions with you and extending your interactions so they get more delightful over time, I think this is something you probably wouldn’t have seen in a weekend’s worth of fiddling with the experience. And I think if you rewind the tape to 2023, it’s really about learning how big a project Alexa+ would be and then starting to put one foot in front of the other, really inventing the space of creating those integrations because it just hasn’t been done. But the amount of work that went into just the interface between a large language model and the downstream systems that complete tasks is — I mean, it’s the biggest body of work that we’ve put in. And it would be too much to even try — without a whiteboard here, it would be too much to even try to explain to you and your listeners, I think, the technical depth that went into it. There was a former machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, Mihail Eric, who did a long post on X last year, sort of his version of a postmortem or retrospective on what was happening with Alexa. And he wrote that Amazon had, quote, “all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.” But then he said that Amazon and Alexa had fumbled the ball because Alexa was, quote, “riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.” He made it seem like the problem was not just that the technology was an uneasy fit, but that there were also some organizational and bureaucracy problems that had to be solved. But I do think the team is inspired by the vision, executing at an unbelievable pace and really creating a lot of invention because there are a lot of really hard problems. This is a company that has offered a lot of AI models through AWS, big market share in cloud-based AI, also recently started an AGI lab at Amazon that is going to be pushing towards something like an artificial general intelligence. daniel rausch I would say we do believe — and I share this belief, the leadership team at Amazon has, that this generation of generative AI is going to transform every customer experience we have. So if you look at the scale and scope of what Amazon does and assume our belief that every experience will be transformed with generative AI, it’s as big as Amazon is at that point. To be as productive as you can be in this day and age and get as much done for customers as we aspire to, you have to build AI into how you’re working. On the 5, my first observation was that after I told it I would like to see art, I feel like every time I looked over at it, it was asking me if I wanted to buy paper towels or Advil something. But I felt like the Alexa+ AI thinks of me primarily as a person who might send more money to Amazon if you just gave me a few more ideas for how I might do that. But I do think it comes across as a kind of insecurity in the device like, if we’re not constantly showing you everything that we’ve built into this thing, you’ll never discover it. One of my most delightful — we have a new LLM called For You, which is a place where we post little notifications about things we think you might be interested in. And I had been helping my daughter study the periodic table for part of her chemistry final, and I was never great at remembering, in particular, the elements that you need a mnemonic for, like lead. kevin roose To piggyback on Casey’s question, I think this is one of the big questions about the Alexa business model is whether you see this as something that is going to make money on its own or whether this is primarily a way of increasing the amount of money that people spend on Amazon. And putting it into Prime brings together both all of a customers’ Prime benefits because you might watch a video, or listen to a song from Amazon Music, or use your Amazon Photos benefit, which is awesome with an Echo Show and review your family photos. So some of the more complicated stuff that I tried with Alexa+, such as setting up routines that involve multiple steps such as emailing documents or research papers to the Alexa email address and trying to have it summarize these things, these things just didn’t work for me. What I found more frustrating that I wanted to ask you about, because I’m actually not sure why this happens, was that some of the basic features that Alexa had previously been good at and reliable at for me were less reliable with Alexa+.

Article: This is “The Daily.” After rolling back a slew of regulations aimed at reversing climate change and pulling funding for the scientists who monitor it, the Trump administration is now taking its boldest action yet. On Tuesday, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, traveled to Indianapolis to a truck dealership to make what he called one of the most significant acts of deregulation in American history. But the endangerment finding is the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases in the United States, from automobiles, from power plants, from oil and gas wells, and more. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Massachusetts versus EPA that greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, others are pollutants and that the EPA can regulate them if they pose a danger to human health and welfare. And taking you back to that time, 2008, the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN’s top scientific body, had just recently established the most comprehensive set of information to that date on establishing that climate change is caused by human activities and the dangers that it poses. It went through findings that US scientists under the Bush administration had compiled about the threats of climate change, everything from the way that increased and more intense wildfires and the smoke from wildfires affects human health to the increases in regional ozone pollution that are exacerbated by climate change. And based on this evidence, the Obama administration determined pretty conclusively see that climate change and the emissions that are furthering climate change cause a danger to human health and welfare. [APPLAUSE] lisa friedman That was an effort to reduce emissions from the utility sector, from power plants in the United States, reducing methane from leaks from oil and gas wells, restrictions on automobile tailpipe emissions. And we and others reported that the EPA at that time made the decision that it was not a legal fight that it could win, and it wasn’t a science fight that they felt they could win. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Interestingly, and I think this dynamic still holds, the business community that back in 2009 had been so worried about the endangerment finding by 2016 had really lost an appetite for fighting it. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] Lisa, before President Trump returns to office this year and targets this endangerment finding, in the middle of his two terms, of course, we have President Biden, who, it seems worth briefly mentioning, makes regulating climate change a very big priority and gets a lot done on that front. And so the Biden presidency feels like a reinforcement of this idea that the overall arc of where the United States is going is this journey toward regulating emissions and trying to use the government to reduce them. Because through the course of Obama, Trump, and Biden, as much as the first Trump administration promoted fossil fuels, weakened regulations, they never attacked this fundamental understanding, which, like you said, has really become, by this stage, kind of embedded — that climate change is real. But the EPA is making a series of arguments and alternative arguments, what one legal scholar described to me as throwing a bunch of spaghetti to see what sticks with a court. One other thing they argue is that even if the endangerment finding stayed in place, they’re saying that the EPA shouldn’t set standards on greenhouse gas emissions because no matter what technology we apply, we can’t make a dent in the problem of global climate change. michael barbaro Putting aside those legal arguments, I’m curious why, in your reporting, you have found that the White House has decided to go after a finding that, as you have explained very clearly in this conversation, the industry doesn’t really want anymore. And so what Trump is doing in moving to repeal this is really satisfying a request to pull, root and stem, the ability to regulate climate change from the government. michael barbaro It feels, upon reflection, like getting rid of the endangerment finding bookends two very different moments in the climate change conversation in the United States — when it was created back in the Obama presidency and now that it’s coming down. But I think you still see that the majority of Americans — and the Pew polls and others show this — acknowledge climate change, are concerned about climate change, and want the government to take some kind of action — that there is a lot of dispute about. lisa friedman I think when the dust clears on this legal fight — and there will be a big legal fight after the repeal of the endangerment is finalized — I think the question is going to come back to Congress. michael barbaro Not which executive actions stay or get removed and toggle back and forth, but whether the legislative branch ever decides that this is something that it wants to tackle. When Congress failed to pass a big climate law — at the time, it was called cap and trade — he gave a speech where he said, if Congress doesn’t act, I will.

It reduces the amount of money that energy companies must pay the federal government for the oil and gas they extract on public lands and waters, a change valued at about $6 billion, according to one analysis. The bill also delays penalties for oil companies that fail to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that leaks from wells, representing about $1.5 billion in benefits for the industry, the Congressional Budget Office found.

Article: michael barbaro I think we’re going to call — yeah, I think we’re going to call you back on a — for the first time in a really long time — a landline. This is “The Daily.” Today’s total solar eclipse will be watched by millions of people across North America, none of them as closely as Fred Espenak, a longtime NASA scientist who’s devoted his entire life to studying, chasing, and popularizing the wonder that is an eclipse. And I made a promise to myself that I was going to get to that eclipse in 1970 to see it because I thought it was a one chance in a lifetime to see a total eclipse of the sun. And I was amazed that outside the back of the motel, in this grassy field, there were dozens and dozens of people with telescopes out there, specifically there for the eclipse that morning. It’s really only in the last 10 minutes or so that you start to notice changes in the environment because now enough of the sun has been covered, upwards of maybe 90 percent of the sun. fred espenak Well, I think, when you see this all transpire, you can easily understand how people thought this was the end of the world because it seems far outside of the realms of nature. You almost get a three-dimensional sense of the motions of the Earth and the moon around the sun when you see this clockwork displayed right in front of you, this mechanics of the eclipse taking place. And I realized, well, I’ve got to expand my outlook on what’s an acceptable distance to travel to see a total eclipse because the next total eclipse then, in 1973, was through the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. michael barbaro And if you’ll permit me a question that might seem maybe dopey to someone in your field, after you’ve seen one or two or three of these, do they start to blend in together and become a little bit the same? fred espenak So I went to grad school at University of Toledo and did some work at Kitt Peak National Observatory, learning the ins and outs of photometric photometry — that is, measuring the brightness of stars. fred espenak Well, I’ve seen total eclipses from Australia, from Africa, from the Altiplanos in Bolivia, from the ice sheet on the coast of Antarctica, and even from Northern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. [bonnie tyler, "total eclipse of the heart"] Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart fred espenak Of course, we had “Total Eclipse of the Heart.” It was a must-have. fred espenak Well, the eclipses are like benchmarks that I can use to figure out what else was going on in my life during these times, because I remember the dates of every single eclipse I’ve been to. It reminds me of when Pat and I got married and between which eclipse we were getting married and had to plan our wedding so it didn’t interfere with any kind of eclipse trips. But I think, for the rest of us — and here, I’m thinking about myself — this is really going to be my first total eclipse, at least that I can remember. And given the hard-earned wisdom that you’ve accumulated in all your decades of chasing eclipses around the world, I wonder if you can give us just a little bit of advice for how to best live inside this very brief window of a total solar eclipse, to make sure, not to be cliche, but that we make it count. fred espenak Well, I think one mistake that people tend to make is getting preoccupied with recording everything in their lives, what they had for lunch, what they had for dinner.

The stigma was a holdover from the early 20th century, when the nation’s first federal drug law made it illegal for doctors to prescribe narcotics to patients known to be addicted — even to treat withdrawal symptoms or physical dependence. Reckitt wanted a special designation from the Food and Drug Administration called orphan-drug status, which among other financial benefits barred generic competition for the first seven years a drug was on the market.

Media organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. The school district is expected to release police service and 911 call records; evidence logs related to the shooting; body-worn and security camera footage from Robb Elementary; student files for the shooter; internal communications among district officials; and results of school safety audits. It could also make public personnel files and other records related to Pete Arredondo, the former Uvalde schools police chief who was fired and indicted for his role in the police response. Records from the county are expected to include incident and 911 reports concerning Robb Elementary and other locations; sheriff dispatch logs and radio traffic; video footage; ballistics and evidence logs; and reports of law enforcement interactions with the shooter and his mother.

Article: The death of a New York City police officer in last week’s midtown office tower shooting is highlighting the growth of Bangladeshi immigrants in the nation’s largest police force New York Police officers hang a banner for the funeral of officer Didarul Islam, Thursday, July 31, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Angelina Katsanis) NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer’s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association. Didarul Islam — one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL’s headquarters — was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty. Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community. Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. “His legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.” When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells. Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved. The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them. “I never dreamt that I would go this far, but I always had an ambition to go somewhere where I can be challenged,” said Siddique, now a member of Mayor Eric Adams' security detail. Give me a chance.” Ishmam Chowdhury, a 26-year-old officer who graduated from the academy in May, said Islam’s death just a few months into his own career has left a lasting impression. “So yeah, I guess that’s a wake-up call for us that even though this is a noble job, we are definitely at grave risk.” Chowdhury said he dreamed of joining law enforcement even before he immigrated to the U.S. He also served about a year in the police force in Washington, D.C., after it opened applications to green card holders in 2023, but he and his wife felt isolated from friends and family.

District Court via AP) In this image from surveillance video obtained by the Louisiana State Police, Trooper Kasha Domingue confronts Clifton “Scotty” Dilley in Baton Rouge, La., early July 10, 2018. -- Louisiana authorities have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed from the waist down after a trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge and then falsely reported it as a Taser discharge. The settlement reached last month is among the largest of its kind in state history and resolves a federal lawsuit by Clifton “Scotty” Dilley, whose injuries confined him to a wheelchair when he was 19. The terms of the settlement, which were not made public, were provided to The Associated Press by a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to disclose them and spoke on condition of anonymity. State police fired Trooper Kasha Domingue after determining she shot Dilley “without any reliable justification,” failed to activate her body-worn camera and gave inconsistent accounts that were contradicted by surveillance video. Dilley said he hopes the “case will effect change within the state police that will keep this from ever happening again.” An attorney for Domingue, Louis Oubre, declined to comment, as did the state Attorney General's Office. Baton Rouge agreed in 2021 to pay $4.5 million to the children of Alton Sterling, a Black man whose fatal shooting by police was captured on video and sparked widespread anger and protests. One internal report said she “struggled from the onset of the class, both physically and mentally.” The Justice Department alluded to Domingue in its findings on the state police's widespread use of excessive force.

Article: As federal takeover threats loom, the city of Washington waits for the White House to make its move FILE - Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. That still might change in coming evenings as Trump puts into action his longstanding plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” On Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night's operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later doubled down on those comments, telling reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents. In Trump's second administration, the NPS has aggressively stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. Earlier this week, the NPS announced that a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced in line with an Executive Order.

(AP Photo/Rodolfo Gonzalez) AUSTIN, Texas -- A weeklong walkout by Texas House Democrats is blocking redrawn congressional maps sought by President Donald Trump and put in motion a broadening fight across the U.S. There is still no swift end in sight to the standoff that has scattered dozens of Texas Democrats to Illinois, New York and California, where they have been given a warm reception by blue state governors and national party leaders. Congressional maps are typically redrawn once every 10 years to coincide with population shifts captured by the census and is rare for it to occur in the middle of the decade. In Florida, the speaker of the house said the chamber will take up this issue in a special redistricting committee this fall, and Vice President JD Vance met with Republican Indiana Gov. Texas Democrats face fines of up to $500 each day they are absent from the chamber, a rule that was adopted after the party walked in 2021 over a bill that tightened voting restrictions.

(AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez) MIAMI -- A federal judge on Wednesday was hearing arguments over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn't follow environmental laws. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under a 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.” Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to criminally investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe from the Obama era What's known and not yet known about the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump-Russia probe origins WASHINGTON -- News that Attorney General Pam Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama-era origins of the Trump-Russia investigation means that one of the most studied, and politically polarizing, chapters of modern American history will be under the microscope yet again. Here's a look at what's known and not yet known about the latest Justice Department revelation: Perhaps no issue continues to aggravate President Donald Trump more than the assessment by intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf and the investigation by law enforcement into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to tip the outcome of the contest. Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tapped as special counsel by Trump’s first Justice Department to investigate, found that Russia had waged a multi-prong operation in Trump's favor and that the Republican president's campaign welcomed the aid. As president for a second time, Trump has made no secret of his desire to use the Justice Department as a weapon of retribution against perceived political adversaries he sees as having smeared him, including by calling for Obama-era officials to be jailed. And his administration, now more broadly and across multiple agencies, has been engaged in a effort to reopen the long-accepted conclusion — including among prominent Republicans — of Russian interference and to scrutinize the officials involved in reaching that assessment. The Justice Department has not disclosed, for instance, which prosecutors are pursuing the investigation, where the grand jury that might hear evidence is located and whether and when law enforcement officials might seek to bring criminal charges. The Justice Department, in an unusual statement last month, appeared to confirm the existence of an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Brennan but provided no details. It’s not clear who might be targeted in the investigation, but the Trump administration has been aggressively challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions that had seemed settled long ago. It's been a welcome diversion for the administration as it confronts a wave of criticism from Trump's base and conservative influencers over the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. In the last month, Trump administration officials and allies have released a series of documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference and at portraying the original Russia investigation as an Obama administration frame-job. The documents have been hailed by Trump and other supporters as incontrovertible proof of a conspiracy, but a close inspection of the records shows they fall well short of that. Among the documents released by Tulsi Gabbard, the administration's director of national intelligence, are emails showing that Obama administration officials recognized in 2016 that Russians had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in favor of Trump. But the absence of evidence that votes were switched — something the Obama administration never alleged — has no bearing on the ample evidence of other forms of Russia interference, including a hack-and-leak operation involving Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and spreading disinformation. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a previously classified annex of a 2023 report by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. The annex included a series of emails, including one from July 2016 that was purportedly sent by a senior staffer at a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire investor George Soros, that referred to a plan approved by then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia at a time when the public was focusing on her use of a private email server. The report said the Durham team's best assessment was that the message was “a composites of several emails” the Russians had obtained from hacking — raising the likelihood that it was a product of Russian disinformation. An annex in a classified version of the assessment contained a summary of the so-called Steele dossier — a compilation of opposition research that included uncorroborated rumors and salacious gossip about Trump and Russia. Multiple government reports, including not only from Mueller but also a Republican-led Senate intelligence committee that included current Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have documented Russia's activities in painstaking detail. To be sure, reports from the Justice Department inspector general and Durham also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the Justice Department submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a little-known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email. It is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry.

Gavin Newsom, accompanied by several members of the Texas state Legislature, calls for a new way for California to redraw its voting districts, during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025. (AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli,File) AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states — California and Texas — grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term. In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state’s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans’ 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters. A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation — even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race. Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.” Legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, like in 2021, when many Democrats left Texas for 38 days to protest proposed voting restrictions. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders could “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served.

Article: The Trump administration wants to end two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health The Trump administration is moving to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health, potentially shutting off an important source of data for scientists, policymakers and farmers. President Donald Trump's budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing. NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.” But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development. They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said. If it doesn't, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money. Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S.

Secret Service said it requested the increased waterflow for the Little Miami River, first reported by The Guardian, to ensure motorized watercraft and emergency personnel “could operate safely” while protecting the Republican vice president, whose home is in Cincinnati. Bush, said on X that “it’s outrageous for the Army corps of engineers to spend taxpayer money to increase water flow in a river so @VP can go canoeing when budget cuts to the National Park Service have severely impacted family vacations for everyone else.” The Corps of Engineers' Louisville District temporarily increased outflows from the Caesar Creek Lake in southwest Ohio into the Little Miami “to support safe navigation of U.S. During a recent trip to Italy, the Roman Colosseum was closed to the public so that his wife, Usha, and their children could take a tour, sparking anger among some tourists.

Article: Lindsey Graham, shuttering his effort to oust the four-term incumbent after just more than a month and eschewing a “political climate that rewards deception over honesty, or ambition over unity.” In posts on social media, Bauer wrote Friday that he had decided to shutter his campaign “after deep prayer and reflection,” saying he believed “we must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.” He stopped short of endorsing any of the remaining candidates in the race to challenge Graham, who already has backing from President Donald Trump. In a pre-launch interview with The Associated Press, Bauer described himself as “a real, America First conservative” intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives’ true values, and he said “Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it.” Republicans dominate South Carolina’s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries. Graham — whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years — has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change. For this cycle, Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February and quickly secured Trump’s endorsement, and Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump’s 2024 bid, is serving as a senior adviser. At his 2024 campaign’s South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer, who served on his state leadership committee, “a friend of mine, somebody that could, I think, run for almost any office and win.” Bauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at age 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) It might be hard to find someone to have your back in politics if you get caught lying about your life story, become one of a handful of people ever expelled from Congress and then are thrown into federal prison. Marjorie Taylor Greene formally came to the aid of the disgraced ex-congressman with a request that his seven-year prison sentence be commuted, arguing that the length of the term represented “a grave injustice.” The plea, which was sent to a Justice Department pardon attorney, came less than two weeks after Santos began his sentence. Santos is an abusive overreach by the judicial system.” Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with the conservative news outlet Newsmax last week, said no one has talked to him about taking action in Santos’ case, but added “that’s a long time” when told of the ex-congressman’s seven-year sentence. “And I didn’t know him but he was 100% for Trump.” Santos pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft following a damaging indictment that alleged he stole from political donors, paid for personal expenses with campaign contributions, lied to Congress and collected unemployment benefits while working. In a dispatch from prison published Monday in the The South Shore Press, a newspaper on Long Island, Santos wrote, “It’s been just over a week now, but I can tell you this much: when people say ‘prison sucks,’ they aren’t just talking about the bars and the bunks.” "It’s not just the loss of freedom — it’s the erosion of your dignity.

(Azerbaijani Presidential Press Office via AP) WASHINGTON -- The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a peace deal Friday at the White House that could potentially put an end to decades of conflict, President Donald Trump said. to “pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region.” “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP,’” Trump wrote Thursday night on his Truth Social site. The prospective agreement could potentially put an end to decades of conflict and set the stage for a reopening of key transportation corridors across the South Caucasus that have been shut since the early 1990s. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreements included a major breakthrough establishing a key transit corridor across the region, which had been a hang-up in peace talks The agreement, according to the officials, would give the U.S. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fueled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years. When the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan. “Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine. The prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran. Turkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. “For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.

His daughter Luci Baines Johnson told The Associated Press in a 2023 interview that he did it to honor the courage of members who had supported the legislation even though it could cost them their seats in Congress. There were several elements to the law, but it primarily ended the discriminatory practices against Black voters that were prevalent in many states, including poll taxes and literacy tests that allowed those voters to be turned away. The law also established a process known as preclearance, which required that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discriminatory practices in voting get federal approval before making changes to the way they hold elections. Despite the amendment, several Southern states were able to enact literacy tests on Black citizens that were not required of white citizens who had either voted or were descendants of voters from before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear a case out of North Dakota in which the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has held that private individuals and entities cannot file voting rights challenges. There also are ongoing actions at the state level as well as an executive order by Trump and congressional legislation that would require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Article: Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican plan for congressional redistricting are pleading for donations to help cover their costs After leaving Texas for Illinois to prevent a legislative vote on a Republican redistricting plan, state House Democratic leader Gene Wu needed a means to project his voice — and viewpoints — to a national audience. Now Texas Democrats are pleading for donations to help finance what could be a walkout of weeks — if not months — in a high-stakes attempt to prevent the Republican majority from passing a plan sought by President Donald Trump. “We’re getting a lot of small-dollar donations,” Wu told The Associated Press, "and that’s going to be used to help keep this thing going.” A political group led by Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor and Senate, gave money to the Texas House Democratic Caucus to help cover the up-front costs, according to a spokesperson for the group, Powered by People. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said Wednesday he's launching an investigation into whether O'Rourke's group has committed bribery by a “financial influence scheme” benefiting Democrats who left Texas. Not only could Texas Democrats face thousands of dollars in out-of-state lodging and dining costs, they also could eventually face fines of $500 for each day they are absent, which under House rules cannot be paid from their office budgets or political contributions. Jose Menendez joined Democrats from other states at a rally in Boston, where he noted that the potential daily fine for quorum-breaking lawmakers is nearly as large as their entire monthly legislative salary. Some Democrats in the Texas Senate have traveled out of state this week to support their House colleagues, but lawmakers in that chamber are not leaving the state to hold up legislative business. We don’t have billionaires who are funding this operation.” The House Democratic Caucus has set up a website seeking donations of between $25 and $2,500 — with a default amount of $250. Earlier this week, Abbott asked the state's highest court to remove Wu from office and ordered the Texas Rangers to investigate possible bribery charges related to how Democrats are paying for the walkout, alleging anyone who financially helped them could be culpable. Before Democrats decided to leave Texas, Wu said he called potential allies for assurance “that there would be resources that would come to our assistance.” But he said that's no different from an aspiring candidate asking others for support before officially launching a campaign. Texas Democrats aren’t worried that they'll be forced to return home in the near future because of a lack of money, said Luke Warford, founder of Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund, a Texas fundraising and organizing group. But "when you think about it in the context of what Donald Trump has to gain and what Democrats might lose in the short term, it’s just not even close to the cost of trying to win back either these races or a bunch of other races in the country.” The Democratic lawmakers have been holed up at a hotel and conference center outside Chicago that was evacuated Wednesday after an unfounded bomb threat. "Our hotel bills seem so minor compared to what we’re trying to do — to protect democracy.” ___ Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, John O'Connor in Springfield, Illinois, and Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report.

Article: Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said the additional $600 million provided annually for Medicaid is hundreds of millions short and unless addressed would require reducing optional services, provider rates or both. “This Band-Aid budget fails to invest in our teachers and students, fails to keep families safe, fails to value hardworking state employees, and fails to fully fund health care," Stein said in a news release. “Despite these serious reservations, I am signing this bill into law because it keeps the lights on.” The new law does cover anticipated enrollment changes for K-12 schools and community colleges, as well as for experience-based pay raises already in state law for teachers. Stein's veto seeks to block a decision by North Carolina legislative leaders to join the tax-credit program contained in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill that he signed into law last month. The program provides starting in 2027 a one-to-one credit equal to up to $1,700 for those who donate to certain “scholarship granting organizations,” with those distributing K-12 private-school scholarships among them. The federal law said each state must opt in to the program, and North Carolina Republicans who have already greatly expanded state-funded scholarships wanted North Carolina to be the first to do so. Stein's veto message aligned with arguments by Democratic state legislators who voted against the state measure last week that the program shifts federal funding away from helping public schools and helps wealthy people who can already afford private school for their children. Stein said he would opt in to the program for the state once the federal government issued sound written guidance on program rules because he sees opportunities to “benefit North Carolina’s public school kids.” So, he added, the bill on his desk is “unnecessary.” The vetoed bill now returns to the General Assembly, where override votes could happen as early as Aug. Republicans are but one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority, and last week lawmakers were able to gain the Democratic support needed to override eight of Stein's 14 earlier vetoes. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said Wednesday that with the veto Stein is "attempting to usurp the General Assembly’s authority to set tax policy” and anticipated a veto override "to ensure North Carolina can participate in President Trump’s signature school choice initiative.” Stein also signed Wednesday legislation creating an expedited removal process for homeowners and landlords to remove people unauthorized to live on their property.

Article: As President Donald Trump pressures Republican states to reopen the process of redistricting mid cycle, Vice President JD Vance is set to meet with GOP leaders in Indiana FILE - U.S. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) Vice President JD Vance visits Indiana on Thursday to discuss redistricting with Republican leaders as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on GOP states to redraw congressional boundaries and give the party more winnable seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Vance's visit comes after Texas Democrats successfully stalled a vote there this week on a redrawn congressional map, part of a bid to secure five more GOP-leaning congressional seats at the expense of Democrats before the midterms. Indiana is staunchly Republican, but opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. But Indiana is also home to Mike Pence, the former vice president and a past governor whose more measured approach to partisan politics still holds sway among many state lawmakers. Frank Mrvan has been seen as a possible pickup in recent years as manufacturing union jobs have left the area, said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis. The new maps were not challenged in court after they were approved in 2021, not even by Democrats and allies who had opposed the changes that also gave a boost to the GOP in the suburbs north of Indianapolis. In a statement Tuesday, Mrvan said the Trump administration knows its policies are “wildly unpopular.” “They know that their only hope to maintain control is to pressure the Indiana General Assembly to violate the Indiana Constitution and redistrict U.S. Julia Vaughn, director of Common Cause Indiana, said a costly redistricting process will not look good for Republicans who tightened the belt on the state budget this past legislative session due to revenue forecasts. “I don’t think there is any way they could rationalize spending taxpayer dollars to come back to Indianapolis to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago for purely partisan purposes,” Vaughn said.

(Ramsey County Sheriff's Office via AP, File) MINNEAPOLIS -- The man charged with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. As they announced the indictment, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Boelter’s federal defender, Manny Atwal, said at the time that the weighty charges did not come as a surprise, but she has not commented on the substance of the allegations or any defense strategies. "Accordingly, the discovery to be produced by the government will include a substantial amount of investigative material and reports from more than a dozen different law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.” They said the evidence will include potentially thousands of hours of video footage, tens of thousands of pages of responses to dozens of grand jury subpoenas, and data from numerous electronic devices seized during the investigation. In a series of cryptic notes to The New York Times through his jail’s electronic messaging service, Boelter suggested his actions were partly rooted in the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbor. In messages published earlier by the New York Post, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate. He also reiterated that prosecutors consider Hortman's killing a “political assassination.” Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans’ home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin.

If only people here eat it, it’s going to be a lot of acai, right?” Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. “If there’s too much acai here, people won’t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.” A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. “We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.” Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) FILE - Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, takes a seat for an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, in Washington, June 25, 2025. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move. At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that “the latest labor market data reinforce my view” that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs “will not present a persistent shock to inflation” and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. A fear is that Trump's tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called “stagflation,” where the economy stagnates but inflation is high.

Article: NEW YORK -- Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring — and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters. After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas. I want to buy a place, but I’m not going to do that until I’m living there and spend more time in different communities.” According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions. “The one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don’t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,” Barnett said. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities. Every place has trade-offs." If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Learning the grocery store, getting new cellphones, those are just procedural things, but being away from family — that’s the hardest part.” Sarah Friedell O’Connell, a retirement coach in Boston, looks at relocation this way: “You’re going to get a lot of hours back when you stop your full-time job. What are you going to do with that time?" As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona’s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.” He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators — such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family — and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels. Harmer's rule of thumb: When 80 % of your desired daily routine is achievable in a new location for at least 80 % of the year, you’re in the right ZIP code.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) HONOLULU -- Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific.

(AP Photo, File) BANGUI, Central African Republic -- Officials in the Central African Republic have said that Russia has called on the country to replace the private Wagner mercenary group with Moscow's state-run Africa Corps and requested payment for further security services. The Central African Republic's government has been reluctant to agree to Moscow's demands, because it sees Wagner as more effective and they prefer to pay for services with minerals, not in cash. For years, Wagner has been in Central African Republic, where they are protecting President Faustin Archange Touadera and his government, and helped him win a 2023 constitutional referendum that could extend his power indefinitely. A Central African Republic military official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Russian deputy defense minister made the demands about a shift to Africa Corps and payment for its services earlier this year during several visits to the country. The official said government authorities are reluctant to agree, because they believe the private-run Wagner would be more effective than Africa Corps, which is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry. The military official said that according to the Russian demands, the Central African Republic “must not only cover the costs of Africa Corps personnel, but also pay significant sums of money to Russia, amounting to billions of CFA francs (millions of dollars). "Instead, they hope to compensate Russia with strategic and mineral resources, notably gold, uranium, and iron.” A senior Central African lawmaker with direct knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the demands by Russia to the AP. Unlike Wagner, which fights rebels alongside government forces, Africa Corps is more focused on training and that could be a contentious issues for both countries, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. “I don’t think the Central African Republic has options since they chased away the Europeans.” France, the Central African Republic’s former colonial ruler, had a significant military presence in the country since it’s independence in 1960, but withdrew its last troops in 2022 after a fallout with authorities.

Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to hold an extraordinary meeting Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other top Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert steep 39% U.S. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S & P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.” As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy.

The troupe also made several feature films, including “And Now for Something Completely Different,” “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” and “Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life.” David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of external affairs, said the collection “honors a body of work that has shaped the comedic landscape for nearly six decades.” Palin said he was “very glad to share a stamp with the nude organist!” The group largely disbanded in the 1980s, and Chapman died of cancer in 1989.

This midsize sedan’s model lineup ranges from basic to sporty or luxurious, and depending on the version, you can expect EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of between 43 mpg and 48 mpg. 2019-2022 Honda Insight pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $21,000 to $25,000 Aside from its distinctive styling and impressive technology, what helps the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid stand apart is its dual-clutch automatic transmission. 2021-2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $18,000 to $25,000 Toyota has been building Camry Hybrids for nearly two decades, and the car has earned a reputation for efficiency and longevity. The Camry isn’t the roomiest midsize sedan available, but its EPA estimates of 46 mpg to 52 mpg, track record of durability, and impressive crash test ratings help make up for that. 2018-2024 Toyota Camry Hybrid pricing (under 50,000 miles): approximately $20,000 to $25,000 Compared to a Camry Hybrid, you won’t give up too much passenger or cargo space by choosing the smaller Toyota Corolla Hybrid. In 2024, the SE Nightshade Edition came with spiffy bronze-finish wheels 2020-2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $19,000 to $25,000 If you’re set on buying a used hybrid sedan under $25,000, there are several great choices available. However, if you need a family-size car that achieves 45 mpg or better, the Accord Hybrid and Camry Hybrid prove that you don’t need to spend a lot to get a lot for your money.

Article: Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries. Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program “broken” and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of “inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Kennedy didn’t specify the changes he's seeking. In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program “has taken a hard line” against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to “a nondependent, adult son," according to his financial disclosures. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children’s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm — perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned — and add the condition to the program. The group’s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son’s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

Article: colleges College endowment tax is leading to hiring freezes and could mean cuts in financial aid A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes. The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration. “It’s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for — financial aid.” The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.” For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.

Article: Honda has reported its profit in the last quarter was half of what it was a year earlier, as automakers were hit by 25% tariffs on vehicle exports to the United States TOKYO -- Honda's profit in the last quarter was half of what it was a year earlier, the company said Wednesday, as automakers were hit by 25% tariffs on vehicle exports to the United States. The Japanese automaker reported Wednesday that its April-June profit totaled 196.7 billion yen ($1.3 billion), about half of what it earned during the same period the previous year at 394.7 billion yen. The Tokyo-based maker of the Accord sedan and Asimo robot revised upward its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2026 to 420 billion yen ($2.9 billion), better than its earlier estimate of 250 billion yen. Fujimura stressed that Honda has long tried to promote free trade and fair competition around the world to deliver quality products and, in his words, “contribute to the local community.” “Now we must face up to this new normal,” he told reporters.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON -- The United States is auctioning off the $325 million yacht Amadea, its first sale of a seized Russian luxury ship since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. has said it’s working with allies to put pressure on Russian oligarchs, some of whom are close to Putin and have had their yachts seized, to try to compel him to stop the war. Designed by François Zuretti, the yacht features an interior with extensive marble work, eight state rooms, a beauty salon, a spa, a gym, a helipad, a swimming pool and an elevator. “We doubt it will attract any rational buyer at fair market price, because ownership can, and will, be challenged in courts outside the United States, exposing purchasers to years of costly, uncertain litigation,” said the representative, Adam Ford. “Should the government press ahead simply to staunch the mounting costs it is imposing on the American taxpayer, we will pursue the sale proceeds, and any shortfall from fair market value, once we prevail in court," Ford said.

Article: More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.” A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms" that pits ratepayer classes against one another. Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather. The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share. Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant. Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.” PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power. The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever. Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed. But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs "will be a challenge.” In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the AI boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. These producers "probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.

Article: ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group. They’re barely there — if anything, a fig leaf.” OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can “identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.” “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory," the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. "And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. I’m gonna do whatever it says.’ That feels really bad to me.” Altman said the company is “trying to understand what to do about it.” While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it’s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” ChatGPT generates something new — a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can’t do. And AI, he added, “is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT’s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided. The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person’s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no’ — that doesn’t always enable and say ‘yes.’ This is a friend that betrays you.” To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.

Article: Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio opens a liquid nitrogen freezer used to store blood samples used for research at the university's T.H. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration. You're being cut off.'” The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions — meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to “surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” “Make no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus," the university said in its legal complaint. “But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.” The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of “difficult decisions and sacrifices” ahead. “It’s really devastating,” agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia. "It’s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day." John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts. Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she’s happy to see the culling of what she called “politically motivated social science studies.” Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have “really gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.” But Madras, who served on the President’s Commission on Opioids during Trump’s first term, said holding scientists’ research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn’t make sense. “But sacrificing science is problematic, and it’s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.” Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said.

Article: It also leads to false alarms — and arrests Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Natasha Torkzaban stands outside Lawrence High School, where she and other students have filed a lawsuit against the school district's use of digital surveillance software, Sunday, Aug. When a friend asked what she was planning for Thursday, she wrote: “on Thursday we kill all the Mexico’s.” Mathis said the comments were “wrong” and “stupid,” but context showed they were not a threat. “And it was this stupid, stupid technology that is just going through picking up random words and not looking at context.” Surveillance systems in American schools increasingly monitor everything students write on school accounts and devices. The 13-year-old girl arrested in August 2023 had been texting with friends on a chat function tied to her school email at Fairview Middle School, which uses Gaggle to monitor students' accounts. The school district did not respond to a request for comment.) Taken to jail, the teen was interrogated and strip-searched, and her parents weren't allowed to talk to her until the next day, according to a lawsuit they filed against the school system. Amy Bennett, chief of staff for Lightspeed Systems, said that the software helps understaffed schools “be proactive rather than punitive” by identifying early warning signs of bullying, self-harm, violence or abuse. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others. “A really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience — not something that helps them with their mental health care,” said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues — including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students’ Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. Natasha Torkzaban, who graduated in 2024, said she was flagged for editing a friend’s college essay because it had the words “mental health.” “I think ideally we wouldn’t stick a new and shiny solution of AI on a deep-rooted issue of teenage mental health and the suicide rates in America, but that’s where we’re at right now,” Torkzaban said. She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. Department of Agriculture calls it a "devastating pest" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques." There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

Article: For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it “easy prey for pedophiles.” Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that “no system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.” The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though — as with most moderation rules — people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards. It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission — and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them. "But when you’re thinking about things related to child endangerment or grooming, the types of behaviors you’re looking at manifest over a very long period of time.” Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox — about 6 billion messages per day — and analyzes them for potential harms. “It doesn’t happen on one message because you just send one message, but it happens because of all of your days' interactions are leading towards one of these two,” Koneru said. “Then we say, okay, maybe this user is somebody who we need to take a much closer look at, and then we go pull all of their other conversations, other friends, and the games that they played, and all of those things.” Humans review risky interactions and flag to law enforcement accordingly.

Article: But the moon will interfere with viewing the Perseids In this long-exposure photo, a meteor streaks across the sky, seen above palm trees, in Bal Harbour, Fla., early Monday, Aug. This year, a bright moon will dampen viewing at the time of peak early Wednesday morning, so some experts recommend waiting a week or so to glimpse shooting stars against a darker sky. “This year I’m actually recommending that people go out a little bit later" — a week or so past the peak when the moon will not be as bright, LaCoursiere said. Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.” You don’t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights.

University of Georgia planetary geologist Scott Harris said in a press release Friday that he examined 23 grams (0.8 ounces) of meteorite fragments recovered from a piece the size of a cherry tomato that struck a man's roof like a bullet and left a dent in the floor of the home outside Atlanta. "It belongs to a group of asteroids in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter that we now think we can tie to a breakup of a much larger asteroid about 470 million years ago,” Harris said.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File) FILE - In this long exposure photo, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a payload of Starlink V2 Mini internet satellites lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., late Sunday, July 23, 2023. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays.

(AP Photo/Alfonso Nqunjana) MOKOPANE, South Africa -- A South African university launched an anti-poaching campaign Thursday to inject the horns of rhinos with radioactive isotopes that it says are harmless for the animals but can be detected by customs agents. Under the collaborative project involving the University of the Witwatersrand, nuclear energy officials and conservationists, five rhinos were injected in what the university hopes will be the start of a mass injection of the declining rhino population. “We have demonstrated, beyond scientific doubt, that the process is completely safe for the animal and effective in making the horn detectable through international customs nuclear security systems,” said James Larkin, chief scientific officer at the Rhisotope Project. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that the global rhino population stood at around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century but has now declined to around 27,000 due to continued demand for rhino horns on the black market. South Africa has the largest population of rhinos with an estimated 16,000 but the country experiences high levels of poaching with about 500 rhinos killed for their horns every year.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services will cancel contracts and pull funding for some vaccines that are being developed to fight respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened. The health secretary criticized mRNA vaccines in a video on his social media accounts, explaining the decision to cancel projects being led by the nation's leading pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, that offer protection against viruses like the flu, COVID-19 and H5N1. “To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate," Kennedy said in the video. “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business,” said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations. In a statement Tuesday, HHS said “other uses of mRNA technology within the department are not impacted by this announcement." The mRNA technology is used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, but has not yet been approved for a flu shot. The abandoned mRNA projects signal a “shift in vaccine development priorities,” the health department said in its statement, adding that it will start “investing in better solutions.” “Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them," Kennedy said in the statement.

Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for "depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia." She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. “I don’t want you to be upset, but I’m afraid to leave.” Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the records, which would normally be withheld due to privacy protections, were being released “in light of the extraordinary circumstances.” Tamura worked at the Horseshoe Las Vegas' surveillance department until last week, when authorities say he drove his car to New York and carried out the shooting. New York City detectives searched Tamura’s locker at the Horseshoe casino Wednesday and found a tripod for his rifle, a box for a revolver that was found in his car in New York, and ammunition for both guns, the police department said. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to.

Article: We hear it from the time we're little Why the search for meaning can cause 'purpose anxiety,' and what to do about it “Find your purpose.” It has become such common advice that few question it. “There’s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,” said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose. Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a “purposeful life.” It is, she said in one interview, “the formula we’ve all been fed.” People have always searched for life’s meaning and purpose. “Part of what it is to have a human consciousness is to think about our place in the universe,” said Jody Day, a psychotherapist and author of “Living the Life Unexpected: How to Find Hope, Meaning and a Fulfilling Future without Children.” “But a lot of the places that we’ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.” Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center). As Steger said, “now we’re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit." You might begin, Steger said, by realizing that you don’t have to pin down a purpose immediately; searching for purpose in itself helps generate meaning in life. “Probably my best advice is to take your time and be all right not always knowing.” For Jordan Grumet, author of “The Purpose Code,” there is big “P” Purpose and little “p” purpose, and too many people stress about finding the first and ignore the second. “They’re just like fledgling seeds of, hey, something might be there that you might want to pursue with more depth and more gravity in your life.” Sometimes a traumatic event can change or create one’s purpose in life. For example, Day, the psychotherapist and author, assumed that her purpose would be to raise a family, but by her early 40s she knew she would not be able to have children “I felt so pointless as a human being because I wasn’t a mother,” she said, recalling the grief she felt.

Article: An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started Anti-death penalty demonstrators gather outside Riverbend Maximum Security Institution before the execution of Byron Black Tuesday, Aug. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was “hurting so bad” while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered. Asked for any last words, he replied, “No sir.” Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. “Oh, it's hurting so bad," Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm. “Today, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could," attorney Kelley Henry said. “The fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,” Henry said. Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it “on the merits." A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn’t meet the criteria for what was then called "mental retardation.” But she concluded that Black met the new law’s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

(AP Photo/Louise Delmotte) HIROSHIMA, Japan -- When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Ari Beser’s grandfather was on board both of the American B-29 bombers that carried the weapons. Ari Beser and Harada are telling their grandfathers’ linked stories, and working to seek reconciliation and understanding about an attack that continues to divide people in Japan and the United States. During this week's commemoration of the 80th anniversaries of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks, the grandchildren visited a station in Hiroshima where Yamaguchi, badly injured, boarded a train back to his hometown of Nagasaki a day after the bombing on Aug. The two grandchildren then went to the Hiroshima peace park where they spoke with The Associated Press about what their grandfathers experienced during two of the 20th century's most momentous events and their consequences. When he was asked about the attacks during his first visit to Hiroshima 40 years ago, Jacob Beser didn't apologize, but said: “I wouldn’t say it was our proudest moment.” He said the world needed to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Beser, who was in the back of the aircraft working as a radar specialist, said that all he saw out of the window was a “boiling muddy mess with fires continuing to break out on the periphery.” Three days later, he was in another bomber, Bockscar, above Yamaguchi's hometown. “For me, all I focus on is trying to convey it to people so that it doesn’t happen again." Because his grandfather was on both B-29s, Ari Beser was always interested in meeting a double survivor. Everybody needs hope and this is how I get hope." ___ This story has been corrected to show that the the spelling of the second bomber is Bockscar, not Bochscar.

Article: The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan Afghan children wait in line to get a polio vaccine in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, May 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Shafiullah Kakar) KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press. Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved. In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.” Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.” According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.” Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. “They know about it.” In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.” Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given. Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine. More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems. In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.” “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.” Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.” Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family. In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it.

Patz called the finding “an important new contribution.” Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution. There are lots of components of wildfire smoke.” She said the study suggests “this toxicity is affecting people's long-term lung function.” Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.

Article: DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car. The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards. Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon. The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035. But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. “With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement. Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits. Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.” It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years.

It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,” the statement said, adding; “Vaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.” The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past.

Article: West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class In this image from video, a student eats a meatball sub sandwich during lunch in Parkersburg, W.Va., on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. “Where do we start?” Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, “but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.” More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects. Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. “In rural West Virginia, I don’t think it’s really on radar screens.” In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was “really good.” Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: “Sometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP Photo/Emily Elconin) Trinity Wilson, 12, holds her five-month-old cousin, Jaylen, as she and her family walk around the Flint Rx Kids Baby Parade event on July 25, 2025 in on Applewood Campus in Flint, Michigan. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played. It was called a “baby parade.” The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump’s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate. Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up. “They are helping us prove that this is possible.” Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. “And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.” A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate. But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care — not just the number of babies being born here. “No wonder people aren’t having children and our birth rates are going down.” The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 “baby bonuses,” a policy similar to Rx Kids.

(AP Photo/Farah Abdi Warsameh, File) KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion — some two-thirds of the continent's population — in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday. The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don’t reach that mark, the report said. An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that “contrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa” and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said. According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks — in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance — were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 “hunger hot spots.” That report, by FAO and WFP, mentioned Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories as being of the “highest concern level.” Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen were classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people faced or were projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Torero, the FAO chief economist, said the situation in Africa is “concerning,” driven in part by the failure of agricultural production to keep up with population growth in many areas.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration’s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump. Vinay Prasad “did not want to be a distraction” and was stepping down from his role as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator “to spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday. Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA’s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines. Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder. During Trump’s first term he signed the “ Right to Try ” law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.

Article: A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity. But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges — until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations. Will you marry me?” Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva — whom he met in 2021 — that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity. Any small stimulus — a smell, a breeze, a color — can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv. "It just feels less intense.” A 2014 study in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Israeli ex-POWs and combat veterans tracked over 35 years had higher mortality rates, chronic illnesses and worse self-rated health — conditions partly tied to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.

Article: (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) NEW YORK -- The 17 experts who were ousted from a government vaccine committee last month say they have little faith in what the panel has become, and have outlined possible alternative ways to make U.S. In a commentary published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former panel members wrote that Kennedy — a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders. The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's “destabilizing decisions." The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy’s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.” Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations.

Article: A western New York health insurance provider for seniors and the CEO of its medical analytics arm have agreed to pay a total of up to $100 million to settle Justice Department allegations of fraudulent billing for health conditions that were exaggerated or didn't exist. "Today's result sends a clear message to the Medicare Advantage community that the United States will take appropriate action against those who knowingly submit inflated claims for reimbursement," Michael Granston, a Department of Justice (DOJ) deputy assistant attorney general, said in announcing the settlement on December 20. This settlement is not an admission of any wrongdoing; it instead allows us to avoid the further disruption, expense, and uncertainty of litigation in a matter that has lingered for over a decade." Under the settlement, Independent Health will make "guaranteed payments" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement "historic," saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. Ross said that CMS "created a bounty" for health plans that added medical diagnosis codes as they reviewed patients' charts -- and whether those codes were accurate or not "didn't seem to bother some people." "Billions of dollars are being paid out by CMS for diagnoses that don't exist," Ross told KFF Health News in an interview. DxID specialized in mining electronic medical records to capture new diagnoses for patients -- pocketing up to 20% of the money it generated for the health plan, according to the suit, which said Independent Health used the firm from 2010 through 2017. "There is no upfront fee, we don't get paid until you get paid and we work on a percentage of the actual proven recoveries," Gaffney said, according to the complaint. The settlement simply resolves a dispute and provides closure to the parties." 'A Ton of Money' CMS uses a complex formula that pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients and less for people in good health. Independent Health violated those rules by billing Medicare for a range of medical conditions that either were exaggerated or not supported by patient medical files, such as billing for treating chronic depression that had been resolved, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Gaffney said renal failure diagnoses were "worth a ton of money to IH [Independent Health] and the majority of people (over) 70 have it at some level." Ross filed the whistleblower case in 2012 against Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, one of the nation's oldest managed-care groups. Ross, a former medical coding manager there, alleged that DxID submitted more than $30 million in disease claims -- many of which were not valid -- on behalf of Group Health for 2010 and 2011. For instance, Ross alleged that the plan billed for "major depression" in a patient described by his doctor as having an "amazingly sunny disposition." Group Health, now known as the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington, denied wrongdoing. Ross, 60, said she is now "happily retired." False Claims Whistleblowers sue under the False Claims Act, a federal law dating to the Civil War that allows private citizens to expose fraud against the government and share in any recovery. At least two dozen such suits, some dating to 2009, have targeted Medicare Advantage plans for overstating the severity of medical conditions, a practice known in the industry as "upcoding." Previous settlements from such suits have totaled more than $600 million. In a surprise action in late January 2023, CMS announced that it would settle for a fraction of the estimated tens of millions of dollars in overpayments uncovered through its audits dating to 2011 and not impose major financial penalties on health plans until a round of audits for 2018 payments, which have yet to be done.

Article: Kennedy Jr.'s statements before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday revealed a concerning lack of knowledge about the major health programs he'd oversee, should he be confirmed as HHS secretary. The premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are narrow." In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income. Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, "Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program." He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries -- often with complex health issues -- who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare -- $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is "fully paid for by the federal government," when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees. Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be "rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges." "He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with," Benjamin said. Also, "he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true." Benjamin was asked -- given the number of Kennedy's misstatements -- whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles. [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does." Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed "quite a few instances of disinformation." Multiple times, he suggested "that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll." Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, "Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID." Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations -- which he now denies -- raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.

(AP Photo/Peter Kemp, File) FILE - Mick Jagger, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones perform before a crowd of nearly 250,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, on July 5, 1969, during a five hour concert. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next.

Article: Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre” at the Santa Fe Opera House This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. (Curtis Brown/Santa Fe Opera via AP) This image released by the Santa Fe Opera shows Ryan Speedo Green as Wotan in Wagner's "Die Walküre" at the Santa Fe Opera on July 22, 2025, in Santa Fe, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner’s “Die Walküre.” Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it “the Mount Everest for this particular voice type.” To Green, “It feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.” Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he’s come. Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star. The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing “Die Walküre,” the second of the four operas in Wagner’s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Brünnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson. “My Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,” Green said. “Sensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.” Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of “Das Rheingold,” the opening “Ring” installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel. “When he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.” As a Black man, whose 6-foot-4 height and muscular frame make him stand out in any setting, Green said the role of Wotan provides a welcome outlet for feelings that are often pent up. “When I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn’t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.” Green will perform the “Walküre” Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP. “He called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,” Gaffigan said, “And from the first words on the telephone, he said, ‘I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?’ … I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn’t give up on getting this time. It’s a major ascent in his career.” Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.

Article: But it’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work. It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I’ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during “Saturday Night Live’s” 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she’s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto). Miller’s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest “Dame Of Darkness” is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. There’s lots of fretting over why Katherine won’t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. But coherency of the vision is limited, as is the audience’s investment, though there are some lovely and inspired touches like using Iranian artist Reza Riahi to hand paint several animated flashback vignettes based on her memories of her fathers. Thomas co-wrote the script with her husband, journalist John Micklethwait, which includes a particularly poignant monologue for her character telling her daughters, essentially, to grow up and move on — a mature and worthy statement that might come a bit too late. But Thomas did have the good sense to end with a song that might just conjure up some feelings for any “Heartburn” fans out there: Carly Simon’s “Coming Around Again,” this time a duet with Alanis Morissette.

It all started nearly a decade ago, when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued, saying she was keeping several chimps in “confined in cramped, virtually barren enclosures” at the now-defunct Missouri Primate Foundation facility. Among the chimps was Tonka, who appeared in the 1997 movies “Buddy” and “George of the Jungle.” Actor Alan Cumming, the British-born actor who starred in the movie “Buddy” alongside Tonka, also begged for the primate to be moved. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2022 that she lied to protect Tonka from “the evil clutches of PETA.” She also admitted what happened in the third episode of “Chimp Crazy,” which premiered last year, saying, “Tonka was literally on the run with me.” Just last month, investigators found another chimp locked up in the basement of her home in Sunrise Beach in violation of court orders, documents in the case said. "In the face of these harsh realities threaded throughout her life, Haddix came to form secure attachments with animals.” PETA praised the sentence in a news release, saying that Haddix now “can't hurt another chimpanzee.”

Article: As Starz's historical drama series “Outlander” readies its final season for a premiere next year, fans can now learn about where Jamie and Claire Fraser came from in the new prequel series, “Outlander: Blood of My Blood.” 'Outlander' prequel series 'Blood of My Blood' goes back in time again — to meet the parents Hermione Corfield poses for a portrait to promote "Outlander: Blood of My Blood" during Comic-Con International on Saturday, July 26, 2025, in San Diego. In “Outlander,” "there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that’s what our audience wants from the books.” In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in “breadcrumbs” said Roberts. “We stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.” The big obstacle facing Jamie’s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland — is that they come from families that “don’t get on,” said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. My father’s worst enemy was Brian’s father so I’m sure he’d have had some strong words to say about the whole thing.” Jamie Roy, who plays Brian, enjoys the duality of his character. There's the “tough, stoic, Highland warrior” who he says “rides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.” Then there's this “lovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.” A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of “Outlander,” because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son. “I think he’s accepted death really and doesn’t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.” Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. They end up in the 1700s where Irvine explains they are “trying to live second by second.” "The time they’ve gone back to is not a friendly time to be an outsider at all. They survive by the skin of their teeth.” The cast is already in production on season two of “Blood of My Blood.” Hermione Corfield, who plays Julia, says it's been nice filming “in our own little secret bubble.” Promoting the series has been tricky because they have to remember what happened in season one versus season two.

Article: The Sunday streets of the borough of churches still vibrate with gospel chords, yet inside many of Brooklyn’s storied Black sanctuaries, the choir lofts have thinned dramatically Gwen Davis sings at Berean Baptist Church in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York, Thursday, July 31, 2025. (Fiona Murphy/Religion News Service via AP) NEW YORK (RNS) — On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand‑claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard “God Is” on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as “joy in sorrow” and “strength for tomorrow.” Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.' As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,” said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she’s been a congregant for six years. “I really feel sometimes like it’s not just me singing, it’s my lineage singing.” ___ This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center. Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today. “I don’t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.” According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% — the largest decline among major U.S. Glenn McMillan, Concord’s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish. “In the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,” McMillan said. According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in‑person worship. “People don’t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.” McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Gwen Davis, a senior member of Berean Baptist Church and a choir soloist for more than 40 years, recalled Easter services in the mid‑1960s, when over 400 people filled the pews and four separate choirs led the congregation in song. A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.” During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods. Augustine said singing is praying twice.” Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. “We only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, no — we can’t let this happen.’” Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. "When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,” Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. “At the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other’s pain and celebrate each other’s joys.” McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. “A choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.” Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.

Article: Palmieri’s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after “an extended illness.” The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle’s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums. His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album “The Sun of Latin Music,” and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams. In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: “Learning to play the piano well. Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of “Harlem River Drive,” in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz. A few years later, he introduced the vocalist La India to the salsa world with the production “Llegó La India vía Eddie Palmieri.” Palmieri released the album “Masterpiece” in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year.

Article: How to profit from the resurgence of Y2K fashion A pair of platform mule shoes and a bright blue bag are displayed at Apocalypse, a buy, sell and trade store in Boulder, Colo. Jackson Mangum, a 24-year-old tailor in Eugene, Oregon, said that while he has distanced himself from Y2K and found his own personal style, his wardrobe still has influences of it, including baggy camo shorts, flared jeans and big, funky sunglasses. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.) “Prior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of ’90s styles being back,” New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said. Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children’s old belongings. “The 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents’ generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s," she said. “At the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,” McClendon said. “I think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.” The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet. Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online. People are wanting to show who they are authentically and be able to experiment with clothing.” Downing Peters sees "logo-mania and the resurgence of a lot of these cherished Y2K brands. Like, much to my horror, I’m seeing students wearing Von Dutch again and True Religion jeans, brands that I cared a lot about when I was younger.” The sustainable nature of buying secondhand also appeals to consumers, the experts said. Gen Z has "this awareness of fashion sustainability and the ills of mainstream mass fashion, and the idea that you can shop responsibly by shopping secondhand without sacrificing style and individuality,” Downing Peters said.

Winfrey often chooses new books for her club, but has at times looked to older releases, from Toni Morrison's “The Bluest Eye” to John Steinbeck's “East of Eden.” “It is, of course, a profound honor to be chosen for Oprah’s Book Club,” Russo said in a statement. How special is that?” A conversation between Winfrey and Russo, held recently at a Starbucks in Seattle, can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel and on other outlets where podcasts are aired.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) LOS ANGELES -- If there’s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie “Weapons,” it’s that the best laughs won’t come from the jokes he writes. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious — a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie’s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are “opposite side of the same coin.” “It’s funny because this isn’t even like a proper horror film,” Garner said. “It has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it’s kind of its own genre, in a way.” The town’s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Yet, when Garner’s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage. “We definitely have a, ‘Whoa, not my problem,’ kind of a thing when chaos is occurring, because we see it so much on TV that I think we’re able to just kind of tune it out, even when it’s happening in front of us,” Cregger said. “Living in America, I’ve seen crazy things happen with my own eyes right in front of me, and I’ve just kept walking for better or worse, so I don’t know, it feels real.” Brolin — who's found wide-reaching success across Hollywood, from the 1985 classic, “The Goonies,” to the Marvel universe — initially hesitated when approached for the film. How do you deal?” For Ehrenreich, who’s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, “Weapons” offered a different pace, but its horror wasn’t what drew him in. “The weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I’ve read in years,” Ehrenreich said.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Oregon issued an injunction Wednesday temporarily stopping the mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities grants to humanities councils around the country, saying the cancellations were likely unconstitutional. Simon, an appointee of President Barack Obama, issued a temporary stay on action taken in April by the National Endowment for the Humanities, saying the claims made by plaintiffs in the case were “likely to succeed on their claim that the withholding of the funds at issue in this case is unconstitutional.” Defendants’ conduct reflects a “deliberate decision to flout Congressional command and refuse to spend appropriated funds,” the opinion said, noting, “The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.” The Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled dozens of grants to state and local humanities' councils in April as part of President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts. This is one step — among many that are needed — in the large, ongoing endeavor to knit our communities and the country closer together.” The National Endowment for the Humanities did not immediately answer a phone call or email for comment. Simon said in issuing the stay that the record contained “unrebutted evidence of irreparable harms," noting that “when these programs are cancelled, there can be no do over and no redress.“ The judge rejected a request by the NEH that the injunction be stayed. Simon said the defendants were “likely violating statutory obligations and principles of separation of powers that have existed for decades.” The order also stopped the government from “disbursing, encumbering, loaning, granting, or otherwise disposing of the funds committed to Plaintiffs.”

Article: The chief weakness of “Freakier Friday” — which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion — is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. I’ll admit to laughing out loud — with everyone else older than 30 near me — when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: “It’s like a database of old people!” Touché, guys. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.) Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is “Rebelling with Respect.” Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out “Make good choices!” — just what mom Tess used to say, natch. “Freakier Friday,” a Walt Disney Studios release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association “for thematic elements, rude humor, language and some suggestive references.” Running time: 111 minutes.

Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall." James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot.

(Netflix via AP) This image released by Netflix shows characters, from left, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira in a scene from "KPop Demon Hunters." (Netflix via AP) NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of “KPop Demon Hunters,” everyone is a fan. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 — empowered girl groups used as references for the film’s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X. They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys’ hit song “Soda Pop,” for example, references the ’90s K-pop group H.O.T. She considers “Kpop Demon Hunters” to be “a musical with songs inspired by K-pop,” not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for “Mamma Mia.” The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. “If you don’t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.” Zabrinah Santiago, a San Diego-based longtime K-pop fan and freelance illustrator who goes by ItmeZ online, was so inspired by the animation style of the movie that she raced to make fan art. She sold illustrated fan cards of HUNTR/X and Saja Boys at her booth at the Los Angeles Anime Expo, held in July, two weeks after the movie was released on Netflix. Kang says for “KPop Demon Hunters,” her team wanted to bring together demons and Jeoseung Saja — the grim reaper in Korean mythology — for a film that could look both very traditional and modernized — what she says is common in K-dramas but not in animation. “It’s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.” Santiago was initially skeptical of the title “KPop Demon Hunters.” “I feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. “But I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.” Indeed — if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin.

(Penguin Random House via AP) LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children’s books including classics like “Eat Peach Pear Plum” and “The Jolly Postman,” has died, his publisher said Friday. “The Jolly Postman” (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it “pushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.” Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including “The Ha Ha Bonk Book,” and poetry for primary school-age children, including “Please Mrs. Butler” and “Heard it in the Playground.” Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a “postman, plumber’s mate and grave digger,” according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. For adults, he wrote a tribute to his wife, “Janet’s Last Book,” and two autobiographies: “The Boyhood of Burglar Bill” and “The Bucket.” Francesca Dow, head of children’s literature at Penguin Random House, said Ahlberg’s books have been described as “mini masterpieces.” “He knew that making it perfect for children matters, and above all that the very best stories for children last forever,” Dow said. “Allan’s are some of the very best – true classics, which will be loved by children and families for years to come.” Ahlberg is survived by his second wife, Vanessa Clarke, his daughter and two stepdaughters.

Claudio Lavenia | Getty Images "Loud luxury" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers. A flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo, are seen phasing out "quiet luxury" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry. "We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment," Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last month. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus." The sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom. Ultra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piano have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags. "There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance," Yanmei Tang, analyst at Third Bridge, said via email. Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench.

Kering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a "first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026. "Bringing newness — something fresh which has not been seen before — is, I think, what could make Gucci great again." New creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Venetta and the famously out-there Versace. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time," group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month. The big divide Fashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation. According to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May. Only top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 — though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand.

Article: Kate Green | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images "Treatonomics" — a consumer trend that covers spending on 'everyday luxuries' to larger, life-affirming experiences — is booming as people look for a mood boost in ongoing unsettling economic times. Spending on small-item 'pick-me-ups' is a well-established recession-resistant trend, with consumers often turning to purchases of modest personal items such as make-up, perfume and candles — or even collectible rubber ducks or Labubu dolls — for a morale boost when times are hard or uncertain. First documented during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the term had a renaissance in the 2000s when Leonard Lauder, former chairman of makeup brand Estée Lauder, noticed a spike in sales after the Sept. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth," he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is "much more resilient than people imagine." SHANGHAI, CHINA: A woman checks out the lipsticks at a department store in Shanghai, 16 August 2004. LIU JIN | AFP | Getty Images The Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have "experiences," particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour. "Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330)," Stevenson said. "This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life," Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times." Smith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for "nearly every living generation" and were being reinvented or disappearing, "out of desire or because they're no longer attainable." That has prompted a shift from being able to celebrate 'milestones' to celebrating more 'inch-stones,' resulting in this rapid rise of treatonomics. "For example — for those who can't afford a home before 40, treating has been a welcome respite and a way to express themselves in their environment when a milestone passes them by," Smith said. Urbazon | E+ | Getty Images On a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has "catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits," Smith added. Consumer confidence underlies the mood In the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued "below last year's heady levels," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week.

Article: That was clear on a recent Thursday at the Herald Square station in midtown Manhattan, her gold-colored tip bucket only showing a couple dollar bills and some coins halfway through a three-hour performance during the afternoon rush. "I have so many people who come to me and say to me, 'I love your music, I want to give, but I'm sorry, I don't carry cash,'" said Paruz, who calls herself the Saw Lady. There's no large-scale data on how people in the United States pay street performers, though the Federal Reserve indicates they are most likely to use cash for payments under $25. But while performers say digital tipping is convenient, it has also affected how much audiences tip — and not necessarily for the better, said Danny Tangelo, a traveling magician who performs across Western states. "I do think that there is a little bit of psychology of people walking forward and saying, 'Thank you,' because they might see the QR code from far away, they might have tipped midshow and then walk away," Deitz said. "But then people that didn't pay see those people walk away, and they go, 'Well, I guess it's acceptable to walk away.'" For Paruz, digital payments make busking less personal: Audiences keep their distance rather than coming up to her and dropping in a tip. "People would stop and talk to us." Apps like Venmo and Cash App also take a small cut of money received for goods and services, which adds up when performers are processing large amounts of digital payments. "You might think that it's worth $89, $10, $15, whatever, which is not the same when you're getting cash out of your wallet and you're fumbling around for change." But Broad says fewer performers have taken up busk.co in the United States compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Paruz says she makes less from cash and digital tips than she did when she began performing in the 1990s, while Deitz has hit all-time lows for payment at multiple performances this year. A survey this spring found more than 40% of Americans think "tipping culture is out of control." That has meant many tipped workers in other industries have seen their tips dip.

Article: Starbucks Protein Drink Courtesy: Starbucks Restaurant chains are joining in on the protein frenzy, hoping to encourage diners to pay more for extra macronutrients during a time when many consumers aren't spending as much. From "gym bros" to users of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, many Americans are trying to add more protein to their diets, with the goal of building or maintaining their muscle mass and feeling more satiated after meals. "A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they're looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future," said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. "Generation Alpha, Gen Z, millennials — these consumers are very active on social media, so they're constantly being fed this message that you need more protein, and protein helps you gain muscle and makes you stronger." Roughly a third of consumers said they loved high protein in the second quarter of 2025, up from 24% three years ago, according to Datassential, which tracks restaurant menus and consumer preferences. The coffee giant said in late July that it will roll out a cold foam packed with 15 grams of protein later this year; the regular cold foam add-on typically costs customers an extra $1.25 per drink. "The biggest factor is what I am in the mood for that day, and then I normally try and select a meal that has a least a serving of some type of protein in it," Hutkowski said. In the short term, consuming more protein than your body needs likely won't cause health issues, but in the long term, it could cause kidney problems, according to Diane Han, a registered dietitian based in San Francisco and the founder of Woking Balance Wellness. The recommended daily amount of protein intake varies by body weight but is roughly 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's a convenient, on-the-go way to get in your protein that you're looking for in your diet," said Lori Primavera, Smoothie King's vice president of research and development and product marketing.

The Trade Desk, which specializes in providing technology to companies that want to target users across the web, said finance chief Laura Schenkein is leaving the job and being replaced by Alex Kayyal, who has been working as a partner at Lightspeed Ventures. While some analysts were uneasy about the sudden change in the top finance role, the bigger concern is Amazon's growing role in the online ad market, as well as the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on ad spending. "Amazon is now unlocking access to traditionally exclusive 'premium' ad inventory across the open internet, validating the strength of its DSP and suggesting The Trade Desk's value proposition could erode over time," Wedbush analysts wrote on Friday. The Wedbush analysts lowered their rating on The Trade Desk to the equivalent of hold from buy, and cited Amazon's recent ad integration with Disney as a sign of the company's aggressiveness.

Article: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call that AI helped imbue "greater efficiency and gains across our ad system," thus contributing to the 22% year-over-year increase of second-quarter sales that hit $47.52 billion. In April, Li noted that Asia-based online retailers pulled back on their digital ad spending amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tough tariffs and the closing of the de minimis trade loophole. This quarter, Li said there's been a noticeable "improvement" with those Asian-based ecommerce firms, which have increased their digital ad spending on the platform along with small, North American-based advertisers. Davidson, said that while there is still broader macroeconomic uncertainty, "today, digital advertising in general, is doing well; It is simply an extension of the fact that the consumer is still strong." "There's optimism that consumer spending will hold up and therefore all the downstream markets will hold up," Luria said. "I think one of the things that its earnings taught us was that you can spend a lot of money on AI when your core business is doing well, and especially when your core business has been already benefiting from the investments that you've made in AI," Jasmine Enberg, a vice president and principal analyst for eMarketer, said about Meta's second quarter. Alphabet added an extra $10 billion to its 2025 forecast for capital expenditures, now pegged at $85 billion, while Meta raised the low end of its capital expenditures for the year to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion instead of $64 billion and $72 billion. "They kind of rose back like a phoenix and had some extraordinary results," Luria said about Reddit, which saw its shares plummet over 15% in February after it reported weaker-than-expected user numbers due to a Google search algorithm change. Snap's second-quarter sales grew only 9% year-over-year and it missed Wall Street's estimates on global average revenue per user, a metric that refers to how much money the company derives from each user. Pinterest finance chief Julia Brau Donnelly told analysts during an earnings call that the company is still noticing some tariff-related concerns, "and broader market uncertainty" as it previously indicated in May. Unlike Meta, Donnelly said that "Asia-based e-commerce retailers pulled back spend in the U.S.," underscoring how some advertisers gravitate toward bigger online ad platforms amid any signs of global economic uncertainty.

Article: Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. The probe is focused on whether James' office caused a deprivation of legal rights under the color of law through its civil suits against Trump and his businesses as well as the National Rifle Association, these people said. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers' rights." A spokesperson for the U.S. In 2024, James' office did win its civil fraud case against the longtime head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, with a jury convicting him of diverting millions of dollars from the gun group for his own personal lifestyle. The letter called the "threadbare allegations" the "next salvo in President Trump's revenge tour against Attorney General James." In addition to her fraud case against Trump and his companies, James and her office have launched a number of successful legal challenges to his administration's agenda, dating back to his first term in office. In 2021, he sued to stop her from proceeding with her fraud investigation, saying, "Her mission is guided solely by political animus and a desire to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against a private citizen who she views as a political opponent." The lawsuit also alleged that Trump was the victim of "viewpoint discrimination." Trump later dropped the suit, but has continued to criticize James, including in an April Truth Social post that called her a "wacky" and "totally corrupt politician" who should immediately resign.

Article: David Mcnew | Getty Images News | Getty Images Top insurers fear the climate crisis could soon outpace industry solutions, effectively threatening to make entire regions around the world uninsurable. Günther Thallinger, a board member at Allianz , one of the world's biggest insurers, recently outlined how the world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for financial services, such as mortgages and investments. In a LinkedIn post published in late March, Thallinger made the case for rapid decarbonization, pointing out that entire asset classes were "degrading in real time" as extreme weather events take their toll. Thallinger, who is responsible for investment management and sustainability at Allianz, told CNBC that approximately two-thirds of economic losses from natural catastrophes are currently uninsured, indicating a "major societal problem." We are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. "If this volume just grows even more, we simply have a societal situation that is not bearable anymore because it is just too much risk that is no longer covered," Thallinger told CNBC by video call. It's very, very difficult to deal with these assets as an investor." The warning comes at a time when the world is on course for a temperature increase of as much as 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius this century, according to the United Nations, a level that would trigger "catastrophic" consequences for the planet. Allianz estimates that the cost of economic losses from natural catastrophes is typically around 10 times higher than the cost of adaptation, noting that this provides a clear economic incentive for policymakers to invest in preventative measures. "If we continue, however, with the policies that we have out there, we are clearly on a pathway now of 2.7 degrees or 3 degrees where adaptation is simply not doable anymore. Zurich Insurance Group , Europe's fifth-largest insurer, said in April alongside a research paper assessing climate resilience that the outlook looks "alarmingly bleak." The Swiss insurer cited the Los Angeles wildfires at the start of the year as a stark reminder that even the world's wealthiest economies are unprepared for the impact of increasing climate risks. On an inflation-adjusted basis, Zurich said that average insured losses rose by 5.9% per year between 1994 and 2023, while global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.7% annually over the same period. "If insured losses continue to grow at this rate, premiums for climate risk coverage will need to increase to reflect the additional risk," Zurich Insurance Group said in the paper. "This in turn, will affect the level of protection that individuals and businesses are willing and able to purchase, with potential consequences for the overall functioning of the market." CAT bonds For insurers and reinsurers, the increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events has coincided with astronomical growth in the catastrophe bond market. First created in the 1990s, so-called CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Swiss Re, a leading global reinsurer, said in a recent report that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down.

Article: The Israeli military "will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement early Friday after a Cabinet meeting that ran late into the night. The plan envisions the disarming of Hamas, which has run the enclave since 2007, the return of all the hostages, and the demilitarization of the entire Gaza Strip and Israeli control of it. NBC News reported earlier that commercial satellite images showed the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave. Last week, the world's leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, sounded the alarm that the "worst-case scenario of famine" was now unfolding in Gaza under Israel's deadly military offensive and crippling aid restrictions.

Article: Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. "We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That's what we want to do." Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would "take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said: "Well, we don't want to keep it. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who "look very hungry," that there is "real starvation" there and that "you can't fake that." Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said. officials briefed on the call described it as "a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid" in which Trump "was doing most of the talking." "The U.S. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option. The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. "Now all ideas are being exhausted." The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is "no chance they can kill every fighter." The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened. Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza. "Looking at the condition of hostages, it's clear that they don't have much more time," one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.

Article: PE firms typically sell their portfolio companies through various exit routes such as trade sales to strategic buyers, secondary sales to other PE firms, and public listings via initial public offerings, allowing them to return capital and profits to limited partners (LPs), who are private equity fund investors. Johns Hopkins Carey Business School Jeff Hooke However, PE firms are buying and investing in more companies than they can offload them — which means investors are trapped in aging funds or waiting longer for their returns. The ratio of PE investments to exits has jumped from 2.6x in 2024 to 3.14x in 2025, the highest in a decade, as firms continue to delay sales, recent data from PitchBook showed . Zombie funds The slowdown has a side effect: the rise of "zombie funds" — private equity vehicles that exist but have little hope of fully exiting their investments or raising new capital. It's just sort of sitting there." A growing number of private equity investors are seeing their capital locked in so-called "zombie funds," a 2024 survey by the secondaries asset manager showed . "This is the second time in the last five years or so that the exit environment has been in this wait-and-see mode," said Kyle Walters, a PE analyst at PitchBook. "LPs were much more understanding the first time around … but this time, you see fewer patient LPs," he told CNBC, adding that LPs are opting to sell off portions of PE portfolios to secondary funds as they opt for cash rather than wait further. According to PitchBook, 54.7% of all active PE funds globally are now six years or older, higher than the 52.2% at the end of 2024 — a sign that fund timelines are stretching well past the norm. What's behind the exit freeze The exit slowdown began as early as 2022 but accelerated after April 2 when the Trump administration announced sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs that jolted financial markets, market watchers said. Harold Hope, global head of secondary investing at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, said the core issue is a "valuation gap" between what PE managers think their companies are worth and what potential buyers are willing to pay. Buyers and sellers are not seeing eye to eye," he said, explaining that the trend began after 2021, when buyers became more conservative as interest rates rose, among other factors. "With a lack of strategic buyers, the dead IPO market here [especially] in the United States, firms are left with the third alternative, which is selling to themselves via a continuation fund, or selling to other private equity funds," Hooke said. "It may never see the IPO market or strategic buyer for, you know, 15-20 years." Other alternatives: continuation vehicles General partners, who are the people or firms managing the private equity funds, are looking to alternative liquidity strategies. Goldman Sachs' Hope noted that continuation vehicles provide a way to generate liquidity in an environment when the fund manager may not want to — or can't — sell the entire business at a value that they believe is appropriate, he said. "Particularly as GPs regularly extend investment periods." The exit drought has also led some private equity managers — especially smaller or mid-sized firms — to explore alternative strategies, including allocating more toward public markets. "Rolling up and constantly putting equity into larger and larger deals is not something that we find relatively attractive going forward," said Jonathan Hahn, investment analyst at private markets investment firm NorthStar Capital. "It's an unsustainable practice… especially with business owners wanting to eventually pull out the equity and actually have it as cash." Instead, Hahn is leaning into the public market opportunity, adding that the firm has launched a new public equities fund because of the recent ramping up of activity within the space. He also observed that PE's sheen may be starting to wear off, noting that some investors are asking themselves: Why would I go into the private markets when I can get the same or better return in public markets and have better liquidity? "There is some slowdown in the money that's been raised," Hooke acknowledged, "but still tens and, well, hundreds of billions." Global private equity investment fell to $363.7 billion in the second quarter of 2025 from $505.3 billion in the previous quarter, data from KPMG's second Pulse of Private Equity report showed , highlighting investors' growing caution amid geopolitical strains and uncertainty over U.S.

Article: The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy." Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer," Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, "we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices." If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030. While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals. But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine. India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler. In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price. "Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. "Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line. A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows. "It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Article: The extra duties — set to come into effect within 21 days — will be stacked on top of the 25% tariffs on New Delhi due Thursday stateside, according to the executive order. Its total goods' exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data. The resulting drop in exports due to tariffs would mean the economy grows by closer to 6% this year and next, rather than the 7% growth forecast prior to Trump's announcement, Shah said. With notable variance across industries and little clarity over Trump's plans with sector-specific tariffs, here are segments that potentially stand to lose the most: Engineering goods Engineering goods, including products like auto parts, power equipment and industrial machinery, have been India's biggest of exports to the U.S. Rajesh Mehta, executive chairman of Indian jewelry maker Rajesh Exports, said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday that higher tariffs will be an "additional burden," while calling for government support for the sector . "Without a doubt, the new tariff rate is going to seriously test the resolve and resilience of India's textile and apparel exporters as we will not enjoy a significant duty differential advantage vis-à-vis many other countries, except Bangladesh, with whom we compete for a larger share of the US market," the Confederation of Indian textile industry said in a statement dated July 30 , before the latest hike in duties was announced. for 38% of its exports last fiscal year, making it "the most exposed" to potential risks of the tariff exemptions being rolled back, according to Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. In an interview to CNBC Trump said he would initially impose a "small tariff" on pharma, and then raise that rate to as high as 250% in a few years. "[India's] Chemicals overall have somewhat less US exposure but this masks the high pharmaceutical sector's US dependency therein," said Hermann, leaving the pharma sector highly vulnerable to Trump's potential tariffs. India competes against the likes of Europe in pharmaceuticals; Vietnam and Mexico in electronics; Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam in textiles; and Israel in gems and jewelry, according to Wan. In his latest tariff adjustment, Trump also eased tariffs on Thailand to 19% from the "reciprocal" tariff level of 36%, Bangladesh to 20% from 35% and Cambodia to 19% from 36%.

Article: China's exports have supported the economy "strongly" so far this year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, cautioning that the momentum of businesses' shipment front-loading may soon fade. China's U.S.-bound goods currently face a 20% tariff related to the country's alleged role in the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a 10% baseline tariff, stacked on top of a 25% duty on certain goods imposed during Trump's first term. Trump has threatened to impose new sectoral levies that will impact countries including China, such as a tariff on pharmaceuticals that could go up to 200%, and an about 100% "secondary tariff" for buying Russian oil. China's factory activity unexpectedly deteriorated to a three-month low in July, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index falling to 49.3 from June's reading of 49.7, missing expectations for 49.7.

Article: President Donald Trump announced he would impose a 100% tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for companies that are "building in the United States." Details on how much domestic manufacturing is required to qualify for the exemption remain unclear. However, South Korean chip majors Samsung and SK Hynix appeared to be exempted from the 100% tariffs, the country's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo was reported as saying on the radio. "We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors," Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that companies like Apple that are building or committed to building in the U.S. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge." Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, noted that "the devil is in the details" as there is no clear framework yet on how exactly the chip tariffs are going to work. While Japanese semiconductor process equipment markets may wobble at the start given the headline shock of "100% tariffs," the move could be positive for the industry given the number of Japanese chipmaking equipment that are indispensable for most chipmakers looking to ramp up U.S. As of this moment, the big companies are the "clear winners," said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, citing companies like Apple, Nvidia and TSMC as the ones with the "most dollars to pledge." "These are the big wins that President Trump wants to get," Newman said, adding that the smaller companies that do not have the same scale and leverage will have to negotiate.

Article: Technicians stand next to an oil rig which is manufactured by Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) at an Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plant, during a media tour of the plant in Dhamasna village in the western state of Gujarat, India, August 26, 2021. President Donald Trump added further pressure to India on Wednesday by bumping up tariffs to 50% — but calls for India to immediately stop buying Russian oil could cause global crude prices to spike, industry sources told CNBC. India was once encouraged to buy Russian crude by the United States, and, unlike LNG, Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but traded under a price cap to limit Moscow's ability to profit from its sale. India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil, according to data from Kpler which shows total Russian crude exports amount to around 3.35 million barrels per day, of which India takes about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million. "Joe Biden went to India after the invasion of Ukraine and begged them to take Russian oil, the Indians hardly imported any Russian oil, and they begged India, 'please take the oil,' so that crude prices would remain low, and they did. watch now Industry sources in the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC the country has abided by all international sanctions, and that India is doing the global economy a "favor" by buying Russian oil which in turn, stabilizes prices. India has argued that it if it were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market. "In case India decides to cut Russian oil imports, the refineries likely would try to find alternative barrels from the Middle East, as they used to rely on those barrels until 2022. "Very near term, there is a risk of a pop in brent prices to $80 or above," McNally told CNBC, signaling that the impact of additional tariffs and a potential cut to Russian oil imports would be significantly less catastrophic. This was indeed the case when India was once purchasing Iranian crude, which New Delhi no longer buys and is now sanctioned as Washington doubles down on its maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap." Sara Vakhshouri, the founder and president of SVB Energy International, told CNBC the hefty duties announced by Trump are a "negotiation tactic," aimed at "reclaiming lost U.S. oil market share in India and oil export declines since 2022, and securing equivalent export of other commodity to India." "India has always coordinated closely on US oil policy, including sanctions on Iranian oil.

Article: "India is [a] country with a deep sense of self as an independent actor," he said, adding it will "never play deputy to any sheriff." That marks a stark reversal from earlier optimism, when Modi and Trump aimed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. But Kausikan, who was also former permanent secretary of Singapore's foreign service, said it's "absurd to think that just because New Delhi is shocked at Trump's tariffs, his insulting characterization of the Indian economy as 'dead' and his flirtation with Pakistan, India will swing to China or Russia at U.S. expense." He was referring to Trump's post on social media , which called the economies of both India and Russia "dead." India leaned toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but after the USSR's collapse, India deepened relations with the U.S., especially under Presidents George W. Speaking on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ," he said although there were points of disagreement in their bilateral relationship — such as India's ties with Russia and the United States' ties with Pakistan — "they never let those third party relationships or concerns bleed back into the bilateral relationship in ways that were very debilitating." "All bets are off now," he added. India's External Affairs Ministry responded sharply to criticism over Russian oil purchases Tuesday, calling it "unjustified and unreasonable." The ministry also pointed out that Western nations criticizing India are themselves continuing to trade with Russia. Nikki Haley urged the administration not to "burn a relationship with a strong ally like India," highlighting that China, which is Russia's top oil buyer, received a 90-day tariff pause in May. Former Indian Finance Secretary Subhash Garg echoed that sentiment on CNBC's " Inside India " Tuesday: "Our positions are so different that there is very little possibility of a reconciliation." He suggested India should absorb the export hit and diversify to domestic or alternative markets.

Article: From makers of baby strollers to coding apps, Chinese companies are facing a new kind of customer: the Gen Z parent, with different ideas about raising children and spending on them. "When you have younger, more digital, international and cosmopolitan parents, their spending patterns are very different [from those of older generations]," said Joe Ngai, chairman of Greater China at McKinsey & Company. For businesses selling baby formula, cribs, or maternity wear, lower fertility rates have been a drag on growth, still China in 2024 saw nearly three times as many newborns as the U.S. The baby-care and maternity market was estimated to reach 4.63 trillion yuan (about $645 billion) in 2025, representing around 7% annual growth rate, according to an industry report by iResearch in February. "Think strollers and formula today, but pre-K, private tutoring and family travel tomorrow — all the way to digital learning tools [such as coding apps] and smart parenting apps," said Han Shen Lin, Shanghai-based China Country Director at business consultancy The Asia Group. Before committing to a product, the younger Chinese parents tend to spend more time comparing options, scrutinizing details and seeking out peer reviews online, said Andy Li, principal at Oliver Wyman in Shanghai. "New parents have become more discerning." That has raised the bar for brands as it's no longer enough to offer quality, companies must also explain why their products stand out. "How to differentiate your proposition, your products against other players in the market has been a major challenge," Li said, noting that giving parents more transparency into what they are buying, especially when it comes to nutrition ingredients, will drive first purchase, ensure retention and brand loyalty. That heightened awareness plays into long-standing concerns over product safety in China — an issue still resonating with Chinese parents nearly two decades after an infant formula scandal in 2008. In a sign of how quickly public sentiment can shift, driven by the tech-savvy parents, some domestic baby-care brands raised prices days after Beijing rolled out new family subsidies, drawing a swift backlash on social media. Muted birth rates also stem from an alarming drop in marriage rates, which fell to the lowest level in almost half a century last year with just 6.1 million new couples.

Article: The move was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes after the Reserve Bank of India delivered an outsized cut of 50 basis points at its last meeting in June. On Monday, Trump criticized India for purchasing Russian oil and weapons, threatening higher tariffs and an unspecified "penalty." While domestic growth remains "resilient," the central bank noted that the outlook for external demand is still "uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations." "The headwinds emanating from prolonged geopolitical tensions, persisting global uncertainties, and volatility in global financial markets pose risks to the growth outlook." During the RBI's last meeting, Malhotra said that there was limited room for monetary policy to support growth due to the 50-basis-point cut in June. As such, the RBI would switch its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative." This means that the Monetary Policy Committee, which is the RBI's key decision-making body, will carefully assess the "incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy," Malhotra said. However, the BofA analysts left the door open for a possible rate cut later this year — likely in the fourth quarter of 2025 — once the GDP growth outlook becomes clearer. The RBI also maintained its GDP growth forecast for its financial year ending March 2026 at 6.5%, but cut its inflation forecast to 3.1%, down from its previous projection of 3.7%. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee also said on Wednesday that the near-term inflation outlook has "become more benign than anticipated earlier," while inflation in 2025 is expected to remain significantly below the central bank's target of 4%.

Article: India began importing oil from Russia only after "traditional supplies" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them]." The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as "we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil." According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024.

But that did not quell growing unease within the country, as many viewed the layoffs as a sign of broader and disruptive changes underway in the IT sector, amplified by the growing influence of AI. TCS and its peers have long relied on India's vast pool of low-cost, skilled labor to produce software services, a model now coming under pressure as AI is set to automate repetitive tasks and as global clients demand higher levels of innovation.

Article: Once seen as a small, "unexciting" market for income-seeking investors, Singapore equities have taken a sharp turn upwards, surging to record highs, with major banks and market watchers signaling that the rally is just getting started. According to Aberdeen's investment director of Asian equities Xin-Yao Ng, Singapore's stock surge is rooted in its "safe-haven status," buoyed by a strong currency, ample fiscal reserves, and a shareholder yield that's better than several developed markets. The Southeast Asian nation's market appeal is also lifted by how the Singapore dollar has been strengthening against the greenback, appreciating about 6% year to date, with Jefferies reportedly forecasting that the currency could reach parity with the dollar in the next five years. While telecommunications and the utilities sectors have led the early stages of this rally, Maybank's Wickramasinghe noted that institutional money was just beginning to rotate into other segments including real estate investment trust or REIT offerings and consumer stocks. "We haven't seen a construction boom like this in 10–15 years … that's going to help so many companies, not just the big caps, but the small- and the mid-caps as well." In real terms, 2025 construction demand — value of construction contracts to be awarded — is forecast between 35 billion and $39 billion Singapore dollars, 0.3% to 11.7% higher than pre-COVID levels in 2019, according to the Building and Construction Authority . A more recent driver is also the Monetary Authority of Singapore's equity market development program or EMDP, which aims to inject $5 billion Singapore dollars into local small- and mid-cap stocks to revitalize market liquidity. The first tranche of $1.1 billion Singapore dollars has already been allocated to three institutional fund managers, who are required to co-invest their own capital and adopt active trading strategies — a move designed to lift market liquidity and trading activity. Re-rating prospects JPMorgan now expects the STI to hit 4,500 under its base case — and 5,000 in a bullish scenario — upgrading its outlook on the back of falling interest rates, SGD strength, and capital inflows. "Singapore equities still offer one of the best combinations of yield, currency strength, and potential inflows among ASEAN markets," the bank wrote, upgrading the real estate sector and tipping small- and mid-caps as likely beneficiaries in the second half of the year. Even though the MAS initiative may allow for further liquidity injections through 2025, the bank cautioned investors against chasing lower quality small- and mid-caps at the risk of "being left holding the proverbial bag if or when the liquidity party ends." Morgan Stanley also noted structural risks including tariff-induced slowdowns, U.S.-China rivalry, and the possibility of Singapore losing market share to rival hubs such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, or the United Arab Emirates, if reforms stall or new listings remain elusive.

Article: Businesses across Asia are increasingly warming up to stablecoins for cross-border transactions — a trend set to accelerate further as Hong Kong moves to legalize the use of digital tokens, experts told CNBC. Monthly stablecoin transaction volumes between businesses had surged to more than $3 billion by early 2025, from under $100 million at the start of 2023, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Artemis from May. That has attracted the interest of major payment processors such as Visa , Mastercard , and Stripe , all of which have begun integrating stablecoin support into their payment infrastructure. Capella Hotel, a Singapore-based high-end hotel group, started allowing guests to complete transactions using digital currencies in October last year, due to "growing demand [for] secure and convenient payment option," according to its statement. The boutique handbag reseller is eyeing to expand crypto payments in its Hong Kong branch in the coming months, as well as in its Tokyo branch in the next few years. About 3% of the company's transactions are currently settled in stablecoins — a share that could climb to as much as 20% by year-end, Zhou estimates, translating into half a million Singapore dollars ($387, 512) in monthly revenue. While Beijing sticks to a conservative stance in mainland China, Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of the country, has emerged as a regulatory sandbox for Beijing with the aim of preserving its global edge in financial innovation.

Sales within Nintendo's intellectual property-related business — which includes movies and entertainment based on the company's original games — meanwhile declined 4.4% due to a decrease in revenue from "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." Sales from Nintendo's dedicated video game platform business grew 142.5% year-on-year to 555.5 billion yen, driven primarily by a higher price point for the Switch 2, compared with that of its predecessor, according to the company. Here's how Nintendo did in the quarter ending on June 30 versus LSEG estimates: Sales of Nintendo's Switch 2 now total 5.82 million units, the company said in an update on its investor relations website Friday. Despite the bumper quarterly performance, Nintendo maintained its revenue and operating profit guidance for the fiscal year ending March 2026 unchanged at 1.9 trillion yen and 320 billion yen, respectively. The device, which launched on June 5, sold more than 3.5 million units in its first four days and Nintendo expects it will hit 15 million unit sales in the current fiscal year.

Article: Cambodia "This is a good news for the citizens and economy of Cambodia to continue developing the country," Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a Facebook post on Friday after the revised table of tariffs was released. Thailand Thailand's Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said in a post on X that the tariff rate levied on the country "reflects the close friendship and partnership between Thailand and the United States," according to a Google translation of his statement in Thai. However, he said that the government recognizes the impact of the tariffs on entrepreneurs and farmers, and has prepared "comprehensive support measures," including soft loans, subsidies, and tax measures so as to help Thailand adapt. Taiwan will also discuss supply chain cooperation and issues related to Section 232 in the future, he added, referring to the sectoral tariffs that Trump had imposed on national security grounds. 1] general tariff rate will ease and not burden our economy," according to a CNBC translation of his speech in Malay He also confirmed that Trump would be attending the 47th ASEAN summit in October, being held in Malaysia. "What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market," he said, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to local media, the country's Trade Minister Todd McClay said it seemed as though the tariff rates were targeting countries that have trade deficits with the U.S., but that the size of it was "really not significant or meaningful" in New Zealand's case. "Many of the exporters are saying they have been able to absorb the 10 percent, or in many cases pass it on, but at 15 percent it is going to start having a greater effect on our exporters," he said. On social media platform X, the country's federal council, said it noted "with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." "Switzerland has been and remains in contact with the relevant US authorities. "While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong," he said.

Article: Philip Fong | Afp | Getty Images Visitor interest in Japan plunged in June, amid a prophecy in a manga that predicted a "disaster" would strike Japan in July 2025. The prediction was in a 2021 reprint of a Japanese comic book, or manga, titled "Watashi ga Mita Mirai, Kanzenban" (which translates to "The Future That I Saw, Complete Edition") by artist Ryo Tatsuki. In the original printing of the book in 1999, the cover page referenced a "disaster in March 2011." In March 2011, Japan suffered its most powerful earthquake on record, the Great Tohoku Earthquake, which caused almost 20,000 deaths and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG told CNBC that the rumor was widely circulated in Hong Kong, where it spread over mainstream media, TV networks and through YouTube influencers. "This is the first time we've seen such an incident." Hong Kong and Japanese media reported earlier in July that Hong Kong airlines cut flights to some Japanese cities, including Nagoya. A January report from Japan's Asahi Shimbun, citing the country's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, also warned that the likelihood of a megaquake in the next 30 years had risen to 80%—a development that, combined with the prediction, created a "perfect storm" to deter travelers, Yuen said. However, Japan's Meteorological Agency said: "It should be noted that the issuance of information indicating elevated potential for a Nankai Trough earthquake does not necessarily mean that one will actually strike." Asian tourists more affected than Western ones JNTO data showed that the share of Asian tourists fell year on year in June, but that of Western countries rose.

"India will continue to explore every option that's available to us under the World Trade Organisation to stop such measures from hurting trade between the two countries," Goyal said. "We are always very sensitive to the interests of our farmers, the interests of our [Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises], and will ensure that our areas of concern are well protected," Goyal said.

Article: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty Images Come Friday, the world will have to contend with higher tariff rates from the Trump administration, raising the specter of even more economic uncertainty. Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done "over 200 deals" in an interview with Time Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had said that "90 deals in 90 days" was possible. Vietnam: tariffs more than halved Vietnam was the second to cross the line with the Trump administration, with Trump announcing a trade agreement on July 2 that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slashed from 46% to 20%. One point with Vietnam was a 40% "transshipping" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S, although it is not clear how this will be applied. Philippines: marginal decrease Unlike its ASEAN counterparts above, which had sizable reductions to its tariff duties, the Philippines saw a decrease of a single percentage point to 19% from 20% on July 22. goods as part of the agreement, according to Trump, who praised the country for what he described as "going OPEN MARKET with the United States." In addition, Trump also said that the Philippines will work together "Militarily," without specifying any details. after China, seeing its tariff rate cut to 15% from 25% on July 23, and being the first economy to see a lower preferential tariff rate for its key automobile sector. would "receive 90% of the Profits." The path to this agreement was fraught with uncertainty, with Trump saying days before the agreement that he did not expect the two countries to reach a deal. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou went as far as saying it was an act of "submission" and a "dark day." EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, however, called it "the best deal we could get under very difficult circumstances." South Korea: also at 15% South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement, on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said "90% of the profits" from that $350 billion investment will be "going to the American people." However, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the $350 billion fund will play a role in facilitating the "active entry" of Korean companies into the U.S. It was initially hit with a 34% tariff from "Liberation Day," before a series of back-and-forth measures between the two sides saw the duties skyrocket to 145% duties for Chinese imports to the U.S. For countries without a deal, it appears that a higher global baseline tariff of about 15%-20% will be slapped on them, according to Trump, higher than the 10% baseline announced on "Liberation Day." Countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. India: tariffs and a penalty On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on India, with an additional unspecified "penalty" for what he views as unfair trade policies and for India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia. "While India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The 25% tariff rate is modestly lower than what Trump imposed on India on "Liberation Day," when he announced a 26% rate on the key trading partner, but at the high end of the 20%-25% range that the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier this week that the partners were in an "intense phase" of talks, noting that it would be unlikely for an agreement not to include any tariffs, Reuters reported.

"If you look at Japan, we're taking in $550 billion and that's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get," Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Of the European Union, he said, "They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." "They gave me $600 billion, and that's a gift," he continued. "They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." He also said the 27-member economic bloc would buy, "$750 billion worth of our energy."

"Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit," Trump said. watch now "That is what our trading partners have agreed to, and the president reserves the right to adjust tariff rates if any party reneges on their commitments," said a White House official who was granted anonymity in order to discuss still-evolving deals. European Union In a sign of the disconnect between the two trade partners, a fact sheet released by the White House after Trump announced a trade deal with the EU said that the bloc "will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028." But a parallel sheet released by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, notes only an "interest" from European companies in "investing at least $600 billion" in the United States. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters Moreover, the EU signaled last week that it does not have the authority to enforce the investments since they would come from the private sector, an area outside the European Commission's purview.

"The key to keeping the EU-US trade deal on track will be demonstrating rising EU energy purchases and investments in the US," Peker told CNBC by email. "As long as the trend line is favorable to the US and helps even the transatlantic trade balance, Europeans are likely to keep Trump on board with the current arrangement of a 15% all-in tariff. This tactic worked during Trump's first term, with the EU demonstrating soaring LNG and soybean imports from the US." Underlining problems with the feasibility of the EU's energy pledge, Peker said even if the bloc bought all U.S. 'A negotiating tactic' "I think it is a negotiating tactic, but I would have expected the EU to come up with the first round to be more realistic and more favorable to the EU," Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, lead energy analyst for the Europe team at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told CNBC by video call. She pointed out that for the EU to meet its annual commitment of $250 billion of energy products over the next three years, the EU would need to source about 70% of its energy imports from the country, a prospect that raises supply security concerns.

Article: A fiercely fought series of five Test matches with India — global cricket's financial powerhouse — came to an end earlier this week in what will likely go down as one of the greatest set of games ever played. And finally, there is The Hundred, the shortest of all, which is the brainchild of the sport's governing body here, the England and Wales Cricket Board (or ECB — not to be confused with the other ECB). The competition is now big business and, earlier this year, attracted record sums of investment — mainly from the United States and India — to professional cricket in this country. The cricket board, before The Hundred, had no assets of its own to sell other than the TV rights — and accompanying commercial opportunities — to the England men's and women's international teams, and much of that income went back to the counties. It was concerned that, as franchise cricket took off in countries like India and Australia to the potential detriment of international cricket, the value of those TV rights could fall. This marginalization has hurt the County Championship, the sport's most enduring competition, and domestic competitions, including the T20 Blast, the biggest money-spinner for English and Welsh counties over the last couple of decades. When The Hundred finally got underway in 2021, the cricket board deemed it an instant success: the grounds were packed, TV audiences were high and clips were viewed on social media nearly 35 million times. Mike Atherton, a former England captain and arguably now the sport's most distinguished writer and broadcaster, wrote in The Times at the end of the first season: "Cricket is a great game. Stage it in high summer, charge reasonable prices, give it the oxygen of free-to-air TV allied to the muscle and expertise of an established cricket broadcaster, create a condensed tournament with one match a night so that the narrative is easily followed, and then pour all your love, attention and marketing spend on it, people of all ages, faiths, gender, backgrounds and abilities will come." Since then, The Hundred has continued to flourish, not least financially. This was confirmed when, in February this year, the eight teams in The Hundred were valued at just over £975 million ($1.3 billion) following a three-round bidding process which attracted interest from around the world. That was a particular triumph for Richard Thompson, the board's chairman, who recently revealed that, on his second day in the job in 2022, he received an offer from Bridgepoint, the private equity firm, to buy the entire tournament for £350 million. The highest saw Silicon Valley-based Cricket Investor Holdings pay £145 million for 49% of London Spirit, the franchise based at Lord's, an iconic cricket ground known as "The Home of Cricket." Cricket Investor Holdings is fronted by Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and is backed by, among others, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Egon Durban, co-CEO of Silver Lake, the U.S. The other London-based franchise, Oval Invincibles, was valued at £125 million after a 49% stake was sold to RISE Worldwide, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, owned by India's richest family, the Ambanis. Manchester Originals, meanwhile, was valued at £116 million after a 70% stake was acquired by RPSG, the Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Sanjiv Goenka, who also owns the Lucknow Super Giants IPL team. And Nottinghamshire's Trent Rockets was valued at £79 million after a 49% stake was acquired by Cain International, the property investment firm owned by Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly, the American co-owner of Chelsea football club. The 'haves' and 'have-nots' The arrival of all this money in English cricket has, unsurprisingly, given the passion aroused by the sport and its knowledgeable fan base, created fresh concerns. One is that the money will be wasted, as happened in English rugby union, which received a huge cash injection when, in 2013, the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired a 27% stake in the sport's top domestic competition. Another concern, linked to the first, is whether the English game becomes further divided between the "haves" and "have-nots." The inaugural Leonard Curtis Cricket Finance report, published last month, revealed that the three biggest counties — Surrey, Lancashire and Birmingham-based Warwickshire — already accounted for 44% of the total revenue of all 18 first-class counties in 2023. Rob Wilson, the report's co-author, said a number of counties were overly reliant on England and Wales Cricket Board funding but added that The Hundred was, potentially, a crucial turning point. "What's important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don't waste it." The other concern about The Hundred, not least for purists, is that it and other franchise cricket continue to nibble away at the quality and regularity of international fixtures. South Africans Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen, and Trinidadian Nicholas Pooran, the most-capped player for the West Indies in the T20 format, are among those who have bowed out of international cricket earlier than they would have done so in years gone by, to concentrate on franchise cricket. Only the global sport's big three — India, Australia and England — play Test series lasting more than three matches and then only against each other (although the Australians are due to host a four-match series against New Zealand in December next year). For now, though, it's the height of the summer and this season of The Hundred will feature some of the world's best cricketers, some of whom — like Australia's Steve Smith, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra and Afghanistan's Noor Ahmad — will be playing in the competition for the first time. — Ian King Top TV picks on CNBC watch now As major firms consider shifting their primary listings away from London, concerns grow over the future of the U.K.'s capital markets.

When asked by CNBC for comment, a spokesperson for the Swiss government pointed to Keller-Sutter's social media post following the call, which said that no agreement had been reached during the conversation. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer somewhat dashed hopes of a flurry of imminent trade agreements, telling CBS News in an interview recorded Friday that he was not expecting the latest tariffs to be negotiated lower in the coming days, and that "these tariff rates are pretty much set."

Article: The increase in heat, as well as cultural shifts and income changes, is boosting demand for air conditioning (AC) units, according to a report from the International Energy Agency published last week. But that could change: McKinsey partner, Paolo Spranzi, told CNBC that there's been something of an "acceleration" in the European cooling market, particularly on the back of this year's heat waves. "Things are changing because we see more often and more frequent, longer heat waves, also in the northern part of Europe where there is the lower penetration." Energy demand from the sector, which is responsible for cooling everything from households to hospitals and data center equipment, is often overlooked as more visible sources of emissions from sectors such as cars and aviation tend to take center stage when it comes to government policy. Because heating and cooling in buildings amount to 20% of global carbon dioxide emissions it's a "real key enabler" of global emissions and a significant factor to consider when it comes to how newer generations of air conditioners can drive sustainability, Spranzi said. Earlier in the year, a widespread power outage that hit Spain, Portugal and the south of France highlighted the importance of energy security and of making sure the region's grids are robust enough to deal with increased work loads. "Air conditioning was considered as a luxury, or even as a waste of money, given also the high electricity costs that were here in Europe," Spranzi said, adding that other factors include the rise of work from home and younger generations being less likely to see AC as a luxury. The shift is mostly "cyclical," Spranzi said, with clients telling him that they see 2025 as a "lucky year" — indicating that there is some uncertainty as to how long the trend will last. HVAC boom In addition to soaring demand for portable AC units, firms such as Johnson Controls , which specializes in buildings technologies, have seen increased appetite for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies for data centers, health care, manufacturing and commercial real estate. "As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for smarter, more efficient cooling systems, making HVAC a critical enabler of digital transformation." For McGinty, increased demand for HVAC technology also offers an opportunity for business to save on costs and align their operations with broader environmental goals. McKinsey's Spranzi also said that heat pumps are the core market where his clients are making most of their profit, with innovation driving the need for green, smart and integrated products. There is a lot of interest from private equity firms and a lot of movement with companies acquiring each other to really increase the scale to being able to invest more in R & D for example," he said. In 2019, the top five players were accounting for 45% of the European HVAC market, whereas last year, the top five were accounting for 55% of the overall market in Europe, he said. Grid pressure The outlook for European electricity load growth is "complex," with many varying factors contributing to utilities' forecasts of annual growth of 1-8% over the next five years, depending on the country, according to McKinsey's Diego Hernandez Diaz. He told CNBC that one of the specific drivers that will push up demand is growing adoption of HVAC systems and cooling technologies in homes and buildings, which adds to the electrical load. The overall picture remains one of rebalancing versus sustained upward pressure."

Article: So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, came in at 2.3% in July, the same level as during the previous two months, Friday's data showed. Following the data release, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was more than one basis point higher, while the French 10-year bond yield was up by less than one basis point. Looking ahead, the fresh inflation data does not suggest that the European Central Bank will pick its interest rate easing cycle back up soon, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. And given that ECB policymakers are content with the current monetary policy stance, we doubt that inflation falling slightly below 2% due to lower energy prices would be enough to prompt another interest rate cut," he added. The inflation figures follow on the footsteps of indications earlier this week that showed the euro zone economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.1% in the second quarter, which was nevertheless sharply down on the 0.6% growth of the three months to the end of March.

"We expect that the Court will find that the banks were liable under statute, focussing on egregious discretionary commissions, but will clear them of liability in equity and under tort," Benjamin Toms, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note published Monday. "We believe this is an ideal way for this issue to be handed back to the FCA to set up a softer redress scheme," Toms said, referring to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.

Article: LONDON — Britain's competition regulator on Thursday said that Microsoft and Amazon are hurting competition in the cloud computing industry and called for a probe into their market dominance under the country's strict new tech rules. The Competition and Markets Authority said that market concentration and barriers to entry in the cloud services market have enabled both Microsoft and Amazon to hold "significant unilateral market power" and reap financial gain exceeding the cost of capital expenditure over a sustained period. Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have built huge businesses by offering access to computing resources — such as data storage and processing — via the internet using data centers, large facilities that contain dedicated hardware. The CMA is concerned that certain practices within the space, such as egress fees and unfavorable licensing terms, are creating a "lock-in" effect where businesses are getting trapped into contractual agreements that are difficult to get out of. Microsoft said the regulator's decision "misses the mark again, ignoring that the cloud market has never been so dynamic and competitive, with record investment, and rapid, AI-driven changes." "Its recommendations fail to cover Google, one of the fastest-growing cloud market participants," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. Amazon also disputed the CMA's findings and said recommendations for a fresh probe into the two tech giants' dominance of cloud were "unwarranted." "It risks making the UK a global outlier at a time when businesses need regulatory predictability for the UK to maintain international competitiveness," an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. Swift action will be "essential to ensure British businesses pay a fair price and to unleash choice, innovation and economic growth in teh U.K.," Chris Lindsay, Google's vice president of customer engineering for EMEA, said in a statement.

Article: First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. Head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re Andy Palmer The emergence of CAT bonds as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. In just the last few weeks, Greece has been battling major wildfires across the country, temperatures notched a national record of 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in neighboring Turkey, destructive and deadly flooding took place in Texas and climate change triggered record-breaking heat in Iceland and Greenland. 'Astronomical growth' Alongside increasing usage of the CAT bond market by insurers and reinsurers, it is thought that the portfolio diversification benefits of these bonds has helped to drive a surge in investor interest. Reinsurance company Swiss Re said in a report published Wednesday that the CAT bond market has expanded by a whopping 75% since the end of 2020, noting that the trend that shows little sign of slowing down. Andy Palmer, head of ILS structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, said "astronomical growth" had helped to push the size of the CAT bond market to nearly $56 billion in the first half of the year. "One of the statements that historically was made to me in the past when I talked about CAT bond market growth was 'oh yeah, but it's the same guys just doing bigger deals. In terms of the investors buying CAT bonds, Swiss Re's Palmer said dedicated ILS fund managers account for approximately 75% of the market, with he majority of that money stemming from pension funds.

During this period, firms are limited to holding only £50,000 of total customer deposits — well below the hundreds of billions of pounds customers deposit with major high street lenders such as Barclays , HSBC and Santander . Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported Tuesday that a meeting arranged by British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves with Revolut and the PRA was cancelled after an intervention from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. "Revolut is already a regulated bank in over 30 countries, including some of the toughest jurisdictions in the world," he told CNBC, noting the company is worth more than some major U.K banks on a rumored $65 billion valuation . Regulators are nervous about getting it wrong due to the lingering "scar tissue" of the 2008 financial crisis, said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at fraud prevention platform Sardine AI. "My guess is that these complaints and issues have shown up in the BoE's regulatory reports, and they have material, well grounded concerns." Still, Taylor conceded that Revolut has "some of the most sophisticated technology to detect and prevent these issues, and has been at the front line of dealing with the scams issue."

Article: President Donald Trump (C), Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (L), and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan (R) hold up an agreement signed during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on August 8, 2025 in Washington, DC. The deal between the South Caucasus rivals - assuming it holds - would be a significant accomplishment for the Trump administration that is sure to rattle Moscow, which sees the region as within its sphere of influence. "It's a long time - 35 years - they fought and now they're friends, and they're going to be friends for a long time," Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House, where he was flanked by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan and India. Senior administration officials told reporters the agreement marked the first end to several frozen conflicts on Russia's periphery since the end of the Cold War and said it would send a powerful signal to the entire region. The peace deal could transform the South Caucasus, an energy-producing region neighboring Russia, Europe, Turkey and Iran that is criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines but riven by closed borders and longstanding ethnic conflicts. Daphne Panayotatos, with the Washington-based rights group Freedom Now, said it has urged the Trump administration to use the meeting with Aliyev to demand the release of some 375 political prisoners held in the country.

Article: President Donald Trump on Friday removed Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Billy Long and is replacing him temporarily with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, three sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News. The temporary appointment adds to Bessent's long list of tasks such as managing trade talks with China, Canada and Mexico as well as other countries that are still trying to negotiate tariff rates. Trump has long promised to set up an "external revenue service" for collecting those tariff revenues but the task still falls to the Treasury Department and Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The law extends the expiring tax cuts he enacted in his first term, in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay and allowing deductions on auto loan interest payments. The legislation is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over 10 years and lead to more than 11 million people losing health insurance coverage due to Medicaid cuts and other provisions.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC this week that the Supreme Court could end up disqualifying the duties that have been ordered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act enacted by Congress in 1977. "If they were going to rule against the wealth, strength, and power of America, they should have done so LONG AGO, at the beginning of the case, where our entire Country, while never having a chance at this kind of GREATNESS again, would not have been put in 1929 style jeopardy," Trump said of the courts' potential actions around tariffs. However, Alan Wolff, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a report this week that these levies being struck down would lead to a "massive amount of red tape" around who would receive refunds. Markets this year have appeared to respond positively whenever the White House has dialed back on tariffs, and have reacted negatively when Trump has pressed the case for higher duties on imports to the U.S. For example, when Trump suspended the initial "liberation day" tariffs in early April for the next 90 days, the Nasdaq Composite soared 7% in just a few minutes, with other major market averages also posting large gains that week. Companies such as AMD and Marvell , as well as Apple , then posted solid gains with the duties granting broad exemptions to any company that announces plans to add manufacturing in the U.S.

Trump had pledged "secondary tariffs" of "about 100%" on Russia's trade partners, if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, setting an initial 50-day timeline that was later shortened. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a key foreign policy objective of his second presidential mandate, reversing course on an initial thawing of White House relations with Moscow to now pile on pressure on the Kremlin for the lull in diplomatic progress. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff travelled for an eleventh-hour meeting with Putin, which Trump hailed as "highly productive."

Article: President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum that requires universities to collect admissions data to prove they are not engaged in efforts to shape their student bodies along racial lines, according to the White House. Supreme Court ruling knocked down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, but universities have skirted that decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race. Department of Education said in a statement that Education Secretary Linda McMahon had directed the National Center for Education Statistics to collect from universities data on the race and gender of their applicant pool, on the students admitted and of all enrolled undergraduates. Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 member schools, said collecting such data was illegal under the very Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action. "This seems to be an effort to get institutions to provide information that we don't have and that we can't collect." But a senior Trump administration official said the administration's understanding of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action was that nothing in it "prohibits the collection of demographic data as long as such data is not used in admissions decisions." The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter, spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Article: Mary Kay burns incense at the entrance to the state-managed immigration detention center dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades on August 03, 2025 in Ochopee, Florida. A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center — built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" — as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws. Following Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued. The crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply. The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County. Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.

Article: Pavel Bednyakov | Sputnik | via Reuters DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan traveled to Russia on Thursday for his second visit to the country in less than a year, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sign of the ever-strengthening ties between the two states. The trip, according to Emirati state media service WAM, was focused on the two countries' "strategic partnership" and on "ways to enhance cooperation, particularly in the economic, trade, investment, energy, and other areas that serve joint development, in addition to regional and international issues of common interest." The UAE is a longtime close ally of the United States and a major military and intelligence partner. It is also Russia's most important economic partner in the Middle East — and trade between the two has ballooned in recent years, particularly since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Bin Zayed told his Russian counterpart: "We would like this figure to be doubled both at the bilateral level and with Eurasian countries during the next five years," adding that relations between the two countries "are developing at an accelerated pace." Russia and the UAE signed a strategic partnership in 2018, and numerous visits between their leaders have been exchanged since then.

Sergei Savostyanov | Afp | Getty Images The visit by the UAE leader to Moscow "says the UAE values its strategic partnership with Russian and will to continue to deepen ties with Russia," Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute focused on Russia's policy toward the Middle East, told CNBC. "As before, the UAE wants to continue to maintain a diversified foreign policy overall between Russia, the United States, and China, rather than choose only one." The UAE leader's visit also comes as the White House announced an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin to discuss Ukraine war ceasefire efforts — and in the wake of Trump announcing punitive tariffs on India for importing Russian oil, which the American leader says is "fuelling the war machine."

Article: and Russian president since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in June 2021, some eight months before Russia launched the biggest attack on a European nation since World War Two. The New York Times reported that Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he intended to meet with Putin and then follow up with a trilateral involving the Russian leader and Zelenskiy. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: "The Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the president is open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelenskiy." The details emerged following a meeting on Wednesday between Putin and U.S. A Kremlin aide said the talks were "useful and constructive." The diplomatic maneuvers come two days before a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions. The White House official earlier said that while the meeting between Witkoff and Putin had gone well and Moscow was eager to continue engaging with the United States, secondary sanctions that Trump had threatened against countries doing business with Russia were still expected to be implemented on Friday. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said the two sides had exchanged "signals" on the Ukraine issue and discussed the possibility of developing strategic cooperation between Moscow and Washington, but declined to give more details until Witkoff had reported back to Trump.

Article: watch now President Donald Trump has tried to justify firing former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by claiming that her agency's gold standard employment reports were "rigged" in order to harm him politically. And experts say that even if a BLS commissioner wanted to manipulate monthly jobs report data, it would be impossible given how the data is collected, analyzed and released to the public. Nonetheless, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the BLS issued "phony" strong-looking jobs numbers during the last year of the Biden administration, only to revise them sharply downward right after the 2024 presidential election. 5 presidential] election, they put out numbers that it was like the country was on fire," Trump claimed Tuesday morning on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "And then they did a revision about two weeks later, and the revision was down by almost 900,000 jobs," he alleged. When a host pushed back, Trump doubled down, claiming "the numbers were rigged." watch now "They announced these phenomenal numbers the two days before the election and a little bit before that, always these great numbers ...

A Labor Department official, in comments provided by the White House, criticized McEntarfer's leadership, saying that she waited too long to inform the department about data-collection challenges at the BLS. Instead, Trump announced McEntarfer's firing in a Friday afternoon social media post that accused her of having "faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory." CNBC has reached out to McEntarfer for comment. "Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes."

Article: (Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images) The White House announced Wednesday that it is imposing an additional 25% tariff on India, bringing the total levies against the major United States trading partner to 50%. "Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25 percent," the executive order reads. It's the latest sign that Trump is following through on his threat to punish countries that buy Russian oil, as he's increased his rhetoric in recent weeks over President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The tariffs against India came as Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Wednesday in Moscow with Putin, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to strike a peace deal with Ukraine. A White House official said the meeting "went well" and "the Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States." The secondary tariffs that Trump has threatened against countries that buy Russian oil are still expected to be implemented Friday, the official said. "We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India," an official spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs said. Trump's order also directs members of his administration to "determine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil," and determine "whether and to what extent I should take action as to that country."

Article: They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%." The investment pledge is part of the July trade deal between the two partners which includes 15% tariffs on EU goods, as well as an agreement for increased investment and the purchase of $750 billion worth of U.S. Describing the investment as a "gift," Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that the EU "gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want." For its part, the European Commission noted in a breakdown of the partners' trade agreement that "EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029." A spokesperson for the EU told CNBC that the European Commission had reached out to EU industries and sectors to establish their U.S. Other potential areas— in which Trump might also like to see increased investment — include autos, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, said William Reinsch, senior adviser and Scholl Chair emeritus with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at a potential timeline, Reinsch noted that "these things always move slower than expected." "The policy uncertainty Trump's actions have generated will slow down the decision making process even more. "The EU Commission has no power to bind member states on this, and, with the exception of state-owned firms, capitals cannot coerce their national companies' choices either." Arthur Leichthammer, policy fellow for geo-economics at the Jacques Delors Centre, likewise said that, while the $600 billion "is not wildly unrealistic in economic terms," the EU's inability to enforce investment makes it a tricky pledge. "That's exactly the risk," Leichthammer said, suggesting that the EU's pledges have given Trump leverage to add further pressure or even threaten to call off the trade deal further down the line.

Article: The Trump administration on Tuesday formally axed a program launched by billionaire former Trump adviser Elon Musk requiring federal employees to summarize their five workplace achievements from the prior week, as first reported by Reuters. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the "five things" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative. "At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so," OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally. While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June. Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire. Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men. Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as "very manual" and "not efficient." It is "something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were," he said.

Article: Conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch will give President Donald Trump regular updates on his health as part of an agreement to postpone Murdoch's deposition in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him over a Wall Street Journal article about late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week. Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years. The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers "a sworn declaration describing his current health condition" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday. "Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health," the filing says.

Article: The bankrupt home goods chain is being resurrected by the owners and licensees of its intellectual property, which opened the first new Bed Bath & Beyond store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday with potentially dozens of more to come. This time around, the store has a new name — Bed Bath & Beyond Home — and marks a "fresh start" for the beloved brand, said Amy Sullivan, the CEO of The Brand House Collective , the store's operator. "We're proud to reintroduce one of retail's most iconic names with the launch of Bed Bath & Beyond Home, beautifully reimagined for how families gather at home today," Sullivan said in a news release. It's a powerful addition to our portfolio and a meaningful step forward in our transformation." In honor of the brand's legacy, the new store will accept the brand's famous 20% coupon, regardless of when it expired. "The coupon we all know and love is back and for those who need one, a fresh version will be waiting at the door." Bed Bath and Beyond 2.0 has been several years in the making and involved a rigmarole of corporate acquisitions and rebrandings. When the original Bed Bath and Beyond filed for bankruptcy in April 2023 following a string of corporate missteps, it struggled to find a buyer and ended up liquidating and selling off its business in parts. Ultimately, Beyond took an ownership stake in Kirkland's Inc., a home decor chain with around 300 stores across the U.S., and gave it the exclusive license to develop and create Bed Bath & Beyond Home stores, as well as Buy Buy Baby stores. The company said it chose Nashville for the launch because of its proximity to its corporate headquarters, which will allow it to "closely manage every detail and set the standard for future rollouts." While the relaunch is exciting for fans of the legacy brand, it comes at a difficult time for the home decor market. In many ways, Bed Bath & Beyond's bankruptcy was the fault of its management team and execution missteps, but it also faced macro challenges as well, experts said at the time. Competition from players like Amazon , Walmart , Home Goods and Wayfair has made it harder for other brands to capture customer spend, and the overall sector has been soft for several years because of high interest rates and the sluggish housing market.

Article: Sweetgreen shares dropped 23% on Friday after the salad chain cut its 2025 outlook for the second quarter in a row, citing issues with its loyalty program, weak consumer sentiment, tariff headwinds and store challenges. For the full-year 2025, Sweetgreen now expects revenue of between $700 million and $715 million, down from its May prediction of $740 million to $760 million and its February outlook of $760 million to $780 million. On a Thursday call with analysts, CEO Jonathan Neman said Sweetgreen had a "really, really rough quarter." He said both external headwinds and internal actions played a role in the performance, including "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April, lapping a tough comparison with last year's successful steak launch and the transition of our new loyalty program at the beginning of the quarter." The company reported a second-quarter earnings and revenue miss, reporting a loss of 20 cents per share versus a loss of 12 cents expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG. Neman told investors on Thursday that only one-third of restaurants are performing at or above standards, while the remaining two-thirds "represent a meaningful opportunity for improvement." He said the company is aiming to improve operations through the leadership of its new chief operating officer, Jason Cochran, and the launch of a new program called Project One Best Way, focused on improving speed and food standards and increasing portion sizes.

The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff. Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 5 cents vs. $580 million expected The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. Overall, operating expenses were down 25% in fiscal 2025, with meaningful cuts to sales and marketing as well as research and development, metrics investors and analysts have long said were too high for the size of Peloton's business.

Article: Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving the way for its entrance into the market. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss "a significant and clinically meaningful outcome." "Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies," he continued. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill "has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects." The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. They bring Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, one step closer to potentially becoming a new, needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. "The goal was to create an oral pill that was convenient and can be made at a huge scale, really, for the mass market, and had weight loss that was competitive with other single-acting GLP-1s, and that's what we've achieved," Ricks said. Ricks said Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with hopes of launching the pill around the world "this time next year." That launch could fundamentally shift the space, helping more patients access the treatments and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacture pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. There are roughly 8 million patients on injectable obesity and diabetes drugs, but likely around 170 million who could benefit from the medicines, said Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in an interview. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at the University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in.

Article: "I think it was pretty loosey goosey for the last year or two, and I think the companies have got a lot better at that right now," said Manish Kashyap, CBRE's global president of leasing. "They're coming up with policies that allow hybrid structures and allow flexibility, but whatever their new policy is, their implementation around that, and the governance around that, is definitely a lot better." Nearly three quarters of the 184 companies surveyed by CBRE said they have met their attendance goals, up from 61% last year. The majority of survey respondents, 67% of companies, said they will either keep their office footprints at the same size or expand them within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago. Concerns about the economy and tariffs do have some companies hesitating to make long-term decisions, but even with that concern, more are taking on long-term leases than were a year ago, CBRE found. "You have organizations that finally have clarity and decision making, because they've been living in this world of hybrid for so long, and now they know what it truly looks like for them, so all those decisions that they may have put off, even if there's a little bit of economic uncertainty right now, they're still willing to move forward with some additional deals," said Julie Whelan, CBRE's global head of occupier research. Despite the fact that overall office vacancies are at 18.9%, just under the 30-year high of 19%, nearly half of the companies surveyed said they were concerned about the availability of high-quality office space over the next three years. That concern is most significant when it comes to prime space, which accounts for only 8% of the total office inventory and has much lower vacancy rate than the rest of the market.

"We're operating in a very volatile macro environment, obviously a great deal of uncertainty on tariffs, so until we have greater resolution on what the tariff picture looks like, we didn't think it made sense to issue guidance," CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC in an interview. "It's the uncertainty around the tariffs that make things more difficult." The company has already raised prices by $1 to offset tariff costs and is working to expand its business outside of the U.S. I never thought I would see a day that I'm happy to see 55% tariffs, but it's a lot better than 170%, so I think once we have that resolution, we'll be in a better spot."

Article: Elizabeth Warren is calling on the FTC and DOJ to consider blocking Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed acquisition of Foot Locker , writing in a letter to the agencies that the merger could cut jobs, raise prices and reduce competition. Warren, D-Mass., argues in the letter, which was seen by CNBC, that the tie-up could create a duopoly in sneakers and other athletic shoes between the combined companies and its next largest competitor, JD Sports. "This is particularly concerning given that more than half of parents 'plan to sacrifice necessities, such as groceries,' because of rising prices for back-to-school shopping," Warren wrote, citing a July survey from Credit Karma. "Higher prices on athletic footwear could lead to further economic hardship for parents." Warren said the risks of the merger are compounded by the rapidly consolidating athletic shoe store sector. If Dick's Sporting Goods' acquisition of Foot Locker is approved, two companies – JD Sports and the combined entity – would own 5,000 athletic shoe stores in the U.S., which could squeeze smaller businesses, Warren said. "This could mean that independent retailers are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating with suppliers, which could give Dick's and Foot Locker an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct to restrict suppliers from dealing with independent retailers." Under President Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission took an aggressive approach to mergers and quashed a number of high-profile planned tie-ups, including Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri and Kroger's bid to acquire Albertson's . Steel – but it's unclear how new leadership at the FTC and Department of Justice will view mergers in the retail industry, which can be felt more acutely by consumers. Amanda Lewis, who spent close to a decade scrutinizing mergers at the FTC and is now a partner at Cuneo Gilbert and LaDuca, previously told CNBC the merger is unlikely to raise many concerns because combined, Dick's and Foot Locker would represent around 15% of the sporting goods market.

On Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that OpenAI's GPT-5 service would be launching across platforms including Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI Foundry — prompting a response from Musk that "OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive."

CNBC has reached out to Musk-owned X for comment. Altman and Musk have frequently exchanged barbs as part of a long-storied feud that dates back to their disagreement over the ultimate mission of OpenAI, which they co-founded in 2015 as a nonprofit AI research lab.

Article: In this article .FKRX300 Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Ryu Young-sang, CEO of South Korean telecoms giant SK Telecom, told CNBC that AI is helping telecoms firms improve efficiency in their networks. Manaure Quintero | Afp | Getty Images South Korea has tasked some of its biggest companies and promising startups to build a national foundational AI model using mainly domestic technology, in a rare move to keep the country apace with the U.S. The project will feature South Korean technologies from semiconductors to software, as Seoul looks to create a near self-sufficient AI industry and position itself as an alternative to China and the U.S. "The country aims to combine its dominance in memory chip production with the development of indigenous AI." The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) for Korea announced that five consortia have been selected to develop the models. So Korea, at the national level, is focusing on ensuring that we lay the technical foundation to have our competitiveness," Kim Taeyoon, head of the foundation model office at SK Telecom who also leads the company's consortium, told CNBC. "This means the country possesses the entire AI stack, from chips to cloud to AI models, and also benefits from a robust community of advanced AI researchers who are actively publishing papers and securing patents," The Futurum Group's Patience said. Meanwhile, SK Telecom will train the models it develops on its own Titan supercomputer, which is made up of Nvidia GPUs, as well as an AI data center the company is developing with Amazon . The company launched a beta version of its first chatbot based on its own large language model in 2022 called "A." which is pronounced "A dot." Since then, it has developed more advanced versions of the model and chatbot. Any AI models coming out of South Korea's project will face intense competition from players including OpenAI and Anthropic as well as many of the strong open-source offerings out of Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek. "Our first goal is to create a very strong state-of-the-art open source model and we already have an example of those open source models which are on par in terms of performance with those large tech (players) like OpenAI or Anthropic," Kim told CNBC. An open-source national AI model could also provide benefits by giving businesses across the country access to the latest technology without having to rely on a tech giant from abroad.

Article: Meta debuted the Instagram Map tool on Wednesday, pitching the feature as way to "stay up-to-date with friends" by letting users share their "last active location." The tool is akin to Snapchat's Snap Map feature that lets people see where their friends are posting from. Although Meta said in a blog post that the feature's "location sharing is off unless you opt in," several social media users said in posts that they were worried that was not the case. "Instagram randomly updating their app to include a maps feature without actually alerting people is so incredibly dangerous to anyone who has a restraining order and actively making sure their abuser can't stalk their location online…Why," said the user in a Threads post. "We're double checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too," Mosseri wrote on Thursday. "We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share)." Still, some Instagram users claimed that that their locations were being shared despite not opting in to using the map feature. A Meta spokesperson reiterated Mosseri's comments in a statement and said "Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on." "If you do, only people you follow back — or a private, custom list you select — can see your location," the spokesperson said.

A centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles. Tesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis. On Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be "operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents," referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips. On the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent. Musk said the companies "are doing different things." He said, "xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models." Tesla uses "100x smaller models," he said, with the automaker focused on "real-world AI," for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for "artificial super intelligence." Musk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because "they wanted to work on AGI," one reason he said he formed a new company.

Article: In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT WASHINGTON, DC August 6: US President Donald Trump shakes hands with CEO of Apple Tim Cook during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday August 6, 2025. "The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back." Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt. "CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time," said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple. "What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters," said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S. For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning , in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an "investment" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning "already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets," adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year. While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that "the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook." Trump had a different take. In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach.

Article: Novo Nordisk's stock has cratered about 47% since the start of the year, as doubts emerged about the outlook for its GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity. "We note that LLY's upcoming 2Q call is scheduled for 8:30am ET on Aug 7th, as opposed the company's standard 10am ET time slot for earnings calls after the market opens, suggesting potential materiality via topline trial results alongside earnings," Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider wrote in a July 28 research note. According to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, the first few weeks of the switch showed that patients changing from Zepbound to Wegovy was eclipsed by the number of patients starting the drug with a new prescription. Citigroup: Buy rating, $1,190 price target Citi analyst Geoff Meacham said Lilly remains one of its favorite stocks, and he placed a 90-day catalyst watch on it on July 30. We think this is particularly noteworthy given vials from LillyDirect now represent ~20% of TRx [total prescriptions] and highlight increasing potential for a consumer angle in GLP-1 sales … driving uptake going forward (2Q25e $3.1B; +$99M vs. Weight loss of 12-15% is the efficacy bar and continuation of a squeaky-clean safety profile that we saw at ADA for ACHIEVE … will be paramount." Morgan Stanley: Overweight, $1,135 In early July, Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn tweaked his price target, increasing it to $1,135 from $1,133. … Interim Ph3 data for LLY's Kisunla in preclinical Alzheimer's (potentially later this year) could be a de-risking event for treating earlier in the disease course and expand the opportunity for the category, as well as provide lateral read-through to BIIB/Eisai's Leqembi (where Ph3 is also ongoing)" Bernstein: Outperform, $1,100 Bernstein, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all have a $1,100 price target for Lilly's stock, which suggests it could rise nearly 44% from Tuesday's close. Given most of the street follow scripts closely in the US, the upside here arises from additional unexpected pricing (rebate adjustments), underreporting in IQVIA (a possibility), and ex-US performance (due to lower visibility). … Despite the potential for a top-line beat (we see potential for modest 1.2% beat above consensus at 14.6B), we don't anticipate LLY will be rushing to increase guidance, given last years back half challenges and the uncertainty for Q3 that remains on CVS caremark (although initial signs look strong)." Wells Fargo: Overweight, $1,100 "NVO lowering their guidance on Ozempic and Wegovy headwinds could be limited to NVO itself, as they cite continued compounding, competition, and slower market expansion. … Therefore, we would be buyers of LLY on the weakness since we expect a strong 2Q and a catalyst-rich 2H'25." JPMorgan: Overweight, $1,100 "Overall, we are expecting a solid 2Q for LLY with upside to Mounjaro/Zepbound (based on strong TRx growth trends), and we estimate total sales in the qtr of $14.8bn (+$370mm vs cons). Looking forward, we expect some moderation in Zepbound growth as the CVS formulary change takes effect on July 1 but expect the product to still grow TRx in 3Q and accelerate in 4Q. And for the year, our estimates are near the high end of the company's 2025 guidance on both topline ($60.8bn sales, +$1.3bn vs cons) and the bottomline ($22.09 EPS, +$0.07 vs cons) and we would not be surprised to see LLY raise guidance at some point in 2025 (although the company may take a more conservative approach on the timing/magnitude of the increases given 2024 guidance dynamics)." Goldman Sachs: Buy, $883 Haider's $883 price target is about 15% above where Lilly shares closed on Tuesday. " … we expect another revenue beat, driven by an [foreign exchange] tailwind and strong TRx growth for Zepbound/Mounjaro where our and consensus estimates have tracked higher into the print. Into the 2Q earnings call, we also note significant investor discussion on the magnitude of potential upward pressure on the company's FY25 revenue guidance where we expect management could tighten the range of $58-$61bn for the year by bumping up the low-end (based on 1H trends, GS/consensus estimates are $60bn/$60.6bn for 2025). These trends are now well-understood with investor focus higher on trying to triangulate the impact to 3Q25 sales for Zepbound/Mounjaro from the CVS formulary change in favor of Novo that took effect on July 1st."

Article: That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and Eli Lilly 's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance. In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a "cost-benefit review." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services "does not comment on potential models or coverage," the department added. In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for "weight management" purposes. Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far "not been met with a widespread shut-down." But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is "a slight positive as far as industry sentiment." It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen , Roche , AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.

Article: "We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders," Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release. The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in "extremely productive" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us." In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan. When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs.

Article: Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, David Sacks, AI & Crypto Czar and Amy Gleason, Acting Administrator, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) attend the "Making Health Technology Great Again" event in the East Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 30, 2025. The letters come after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, known as the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations – and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank. But he said those proposals "promised more of the same: shifting blame and requesting policy changes that would result in billions of dollars in handouts to the industry." He said moving forward, he will only accept commitments from drugmakers that provide "American families immediate relief from the vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the free ride of American innovation by European and other developed nations." Trump said a collaborative effort towards lowering U.S. Here are the steps Trump is asking companies to take: He called on drugmakers to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations – or what he calls the most-favored-nation price – to every single Medicaid patient. He asked drugmakers to adopt models that sell their medicines directly to consumers or businesses, which effectively eliminates middlemen and aims to ensure that all Americans get the same most-favored nation prices that companies offer to third-party payers. Alex Schriver, senior vice president of PhRMA, the industry's largest lobbying group, said "importing foreign price controls would undermine American leadership, hurting patients and workers." The group added that to reduce price differences with other countries, U.S. officials should "rein in health care middlemen driving up costs for Americans and get foreign countries to pay their fair share for innovative medicines." PhRMA is referring to pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and other payers. AstraZeneca added that it is considering selling some drugs to patients directly, which is a move that companies like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have adopted as patients struggle to afford drugs in the U.S.

Article: The two companies have spent their Covid vaccine windfall differently: Moderna doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, while BioNTech used the money to do deals and diversify, including into one of the hottest emerging areas of cancer drugs. "Just their name was made based off the pandemic and the vaccines that they very quickly brought to people around the world to help get us through that period of time," said Evercore ISI analyst Cory Kasimov. "But the approach they're taking now and the outlook for these two companies is distinctly different at this point." Investors will get a fresh look at both companies' performance as they post quarterly results in the coming days. "From our perspective, the pandemic really showed that the science of what we're doing worked, and the natural sort of response to that was to continue down that path and do more," said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. "We're moving into a time where being a vaccine company is going to be more expensive, tedious and onerous," Foroohar said, citing changes at the Food and Drug Administration under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. "The reality is that we think over the last 10 years, that focus has actually made us successful, and in the pandemic, it certainly had a big impact and obviously was something that sets us up for the more diverse pipeline we have right now," Hoge said. "So we recognize that we may be going through some cycles, but we're pretty confident in the long-term trajectory we're on, and we're looking forward over the years ahead to showing with all these additional medicines what we're really capable of." An mRNA model is placed in front of the "Area 100 R&D" research laboratory for personalized mRNA-based cancer vaccines at a new facility of BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, on July 27, 2023.

Article: Mounjaro met the main goal of the nearly five-year study, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke by 8% when compared to Trulicity in adults with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results come as Trulicity – also a top-selling drug for Eli Lilly – faces a patent expiration in 2027, which could further boost Mounjaro's position in the diabetes market. Eli Lilly said it believes the new data bolsters the case for Mounjaro to be prescribers' first choice for patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without the disease. But the difference in the rate of death from any cause between Mounjaro and Trulicity is "really quite profound" and "definitely something clinically meaningful to us as clinicians," said Dr. He said the data helped quantify the difference between Mounjaro and Trulicity, which will further help providers and patients determine the best treatment to move forward with in their shared decision-making. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, called Mounjaro a "winner" in the trial, with the only downside coming from it having slightly more side effects than Trulicity. Weintraub said he expects there to be a lot of "digging" into the data when the full results are presented at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal in the fall. The results "take away any doubt of why this is the right medicine for a patient with Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular risk," he said, adding that it "makes it even harder to say no to covering this medicine for patients." The results also come as Eli Lilly solidifies its lead over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly plans to submit the heart health data to global regulators by the end of the year, and the company said that could lead to approvals — and by extension insurance coverage — of Mounjaro for this purpose in 2026. Any approvals would not apply to Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro but is specifically cleared for patients with obesity and not diabetes. That's because Mounjaro's current approval for Type 2 diabetes already covers many of those patients: Around 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease, according to the Heart Foundation. In a June research note ahead of the data, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said he believes uptake of tirzeptide "would be largely unaffected" if it shows similar heart health benefits as Trulicity. He said experts agreed that regardless of whether tirzepatide's cardiovascular benefits were superior or matched those of Trulicity in the study, the results "would not significantly alter" the decisions of doctors.

Article: CVS Health on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as it sees strength in its retail pharmacy business and some improvement in its insurance unit. In an interview, CVS CEO David Joyner said the quarterly beat and guidance hike is in part "a tribute to the work and the effort underway within Aetna," the company's insurer. He was referring to a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been grappling with higher medical costs in privately run Medicare plans like the rest of the insurance industry. He also pointed to the company's investments in labor and its new prescription drug pricing model, which has benefited payers and "separated the pharmacy from the pack." But the company's release said the strength in those two business units was offset by a decline in its health services segment. But he said CVS is also "focusing on being in the right geography," noting that the company is still buying stores in the Pacific Northwest because it doesn't have a big footprint there.

Article: On top of higher medical costs, the updated outlook removes about $1 billion from "previously planned portfolio actions" that the company is no longer pursuing, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel said during an earnings call Tuesday. The report Tuesday adds to a growing string of setbacks for the company, which owns the nation's largest and most powerful insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and is often viewed as the industry's bellwether. The company expects its insurance unit's 2025 medical care ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — to come in between 89% and 89.5%. Higher expenses in Medicare Advantage plans have dogged insurers over the past year as more seniors return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. "When we prepared our 2025 Medicare Advantage offerings back in the first half of 2024, we significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing," Noel said during the call. Here's what UnitedHealth Group reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.08 adjusted vs. UnitedHealth raked in $111.62 billion in revenue for the second quarter, up more than 12% from the same period a year ago due to growth within UnitedHealthcare and the company's Optum unit.

Article: In this article UNH Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT watch now UnitedHealth Group Chairman and CEO Stephen Hemsley will face the first real test Tuesday of his ability to regain investor confidence as the largest private U.S. The Dow component has seen its share price cut nearly in half since mid-May, with the stock on pace for its worst year in more than a decade, after earnings in its flagship Medicare program and Optum Health physician practices plummeted. Now, investors want to know how Hemsley plans to steer the company out of the whirlwind, after assuring them last June that "we're humbly determined to earn back your trust and your confidence." Here are three key things investors will be looking for from the company's earnings report. "Anything below $18 — that would be viewed as a negative by the street," Hynes said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix has set his estimate above consensus at $23.36, but said Wall Street remains bearish on UnitedHealth. "While we base our more optimistic outlook on management's assertion that Medicare Advantage remains profitable with the 3% low-end of target MA margin in sight for 2026, clients we've spoken to have expressed concern over continued margin compression in OptumHealth and accelerating (medical cost) trend in core Medicare Advantage," he wrote in a note earlier this month. "Investors with duration were investing in United really for the power of … Optum Health, the power of United steering their own Medicare Advantage members, extracting considerable margin that they hadn't been able to before," said Baird analyst Michael Ha. Analysts said the plunge was due in part to a Biden-era change in Medicare reimbursement standards known as V28, which is making it harder for insurers and doctors to bill for extra services. Mizuho's Hynes said prior billing coding rules left a lot more room for plans to add billing codes related to chronic conditions, such as overall heart conditions, which would provide a higher risk score and reimbursement rate. "V28 is very black and white, so you don't have that kind of ability to add codes, and a lot of codes are removed," she said, adding that has now "led to a structural shift in margins for Optum Health." But Ha noted the V28 changes began in 2024, at a time when seniors started utilizing more care. "We're still confident that Optum Health and United can recover and rebuild unit economics, but we think over the next one to two years, it may potentially worsen."

Article: UnitedHealth Group revealed Thursday it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices, adding to a string of setbacks for a company that owns the nation's largest and most powerful private insurer. In the filing, UnitedHealth said it "has full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process." UnitedHealth Group shares dropped around 2% on Thursday. Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities health-care strategist, said in an email to clients on Thursday that the announcement is "not shocking," but noted that the company previously denied DOJ investigation claims. He said UnitedHealth's decision to admit to the probes and cooperate with the department "all sounds logical as it moves forward with a new CEO." The company announced the abrupt departure of former CEO Andrew Witty in May. UnitedHealth's announcement on Thursday comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in May that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In response at the time, the company said it stands "by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program." In July, the Journal also reported that the DOJ interviewed several doctors about UnitedHealth's practices and whether they felt pressured to submit claims for certain conditions that bolstered payments from the Medicare Advantage program to the company.

Article: On Friday, University of Florida researchers said findings from a new study could lead to the development of a universal shot that can jumpstart the immune system to fight cancer. The vaccine is not designed for a specific virus or cancer cells, but engineered to "wake up" the immune system against the disease, "spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus," according to a UF release. That's unlike current approaches to cancer vaccines, which involve finding a target expressed by many cancer patients or, in the case of Moderna and Merck , developing personalized vaccines tailored to each patient's specific tumor. Here's how the vaccine works: The mRNA shot essentially tells the body to produce certain proteins that stimulate the immune system, including one called PD-L1, which is often found on the surface or inside of cancer cells.

Article: Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty Images For well over a decade, Grace Hamilton, 27, experienced hair loss, heavy periods, infrequent menstrual cycles, mental health issues and difficulty losing weight without knowing why. After 10 months on the treatment, Hamilton lost 50 pounds, saw hair regrowth and reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety "I'm so glad that I stuck with it because it was just clear as day that it was the missing link for me," said Hamilton, who works at a nonprofit in Arvada, Colorado, adding that she maintained diet and exercise while on the drug. She is just one of several women who have reported improvements in symptoms of PCOS after using GLP-1s, a growing class of obesity and diabetes treatments that have drawn massive patient demand and investor buzz over the last few years. "Primary therapies used for PCOS symptoms haven't changed in nearly 50 years." Cree, who is also a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, has been studying the effect of GLP-1s in adolescents with PCOS for more than 10 years. Cree said that's because the Food and Drug Administration has not established specific "endpoints" or goals drugs must meet in clinical trials to demonstrate how effective they are for PCOS. In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company welcomes "independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products, including semaglutide." Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is still unclear if GLP-1s can help address or resolve all PCOS symptoms, or whether the effect differs depending on a patient's age or the specific drug, Ottey said. Why GLP-1s may address PCOS symptoms More research is needed to fully understand why GLP-1s may help some PCOS patients, but Cree said their effect on symptoms appears to be largely indirect. She said a key finding in several previous studies motivated her to start studying GLP-1s: In adults with PCOS, losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve insulin sensitivity. That lowers insulin levels, which Cree and some researchers believe causes the ovaries to produce less testosterone and, as a result, can help reduce symptoms such as irregular periods, acne and excess hair growth. In a recent survey of 1,700 people by the birth control app Natural Cycles, 64% of women with PCOS who took a GLP-1 reported more predictable periods, and 20% said their bleeding days were shorter. Tang added that diet and exercise alone often fall short of addressing symptoms: "A lot of people can exercise very aggressively and regularly or watch what they eat and still struggle with hormone imbalances, weight, and blood sugar." Haley Sipes a patient with PCOS taking GLP-1s. "All the symptoms and being overweight might not seem like big things, but when you have 20 little things that are constantly nagging you, then you're going to be in a bad mood sometimes," Sipes said. More than one-third of employers now cover GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, while 55% only cover them for diabetes, according to a recent survey from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.

Article: The Bank of England voted by a fine margin to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday as the central bank resumed what it describes as a "gradual and careful" approach to monetary easing. The BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at its latest monetary policy meeting, but traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the decision among the bank's policymakers. As it turned out on Thursday, the nine-member MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce the key interest rate, the "Bank Rate," by 25 basis points rather than keeping it on hold. Policy makers have had to weigh up sticky inflation — the consumer price index (CPI) rose to a hotter-than-expected 3.6% in June from 3.4% in May — with a cooling jobs market and lackluster growth. In a statement Thursday, the bank said the MPC "remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term." The MPC was initially split on reducing or holding interest rates with four members wanting to hold rates, four others voting to cut and one policymaker voting for a larger 50-basis-point cut.

But as it faces the specter of rebuilding its devastated state after 13 years of war under a new government with a very shaky hold on power, the country needs all the help it can get, regional analysts say — not further punishment. "After years of devastating civil war, the country is in urgent need of substantial foreign direct investment to begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and development," Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of risk consulting firm Gulf State Analytics, told CNBC. "While the recent lifting of many U.S., U.K., and EU sanctions was a welcome development for Damascus' economic ambitions, Washington's imposition of steep tariffs now threatens to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the United States." A collapsed state Syria had been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorist attacks, with the Islamic State taking over parts of the country in 2014 and a subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group. Yosri Aljamal | Reuters The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December 2024 stunned the global community and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified "penalty" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

Trump did not commit to taking that approach but conceded that it is "a possibility." Trump nominated Powell for the Fed job in 2017, during his first term as president. The central bank lowered its policy rate a full percentage point from September through December 2024, moves that Trump has said were politically motivated to help Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

Article: The Kremlin, an important trading partner of India's and one which had stayed silent as the spat erupted in the last few days, commented Tuesday that Trump's tariff threats are "attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia." "We do not consider such statements to be legitimate," Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday. And to choose those trade and economic cooperation regimes that are in the interests of a particular country." The dispute between Trump and New Delhi is being closely watched by investors after Trump threatened on Monday that he would be "substantially raising" the tariffs on India, although he did not specify the level of the higher levies. He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours. so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy," Trump said.

Article: Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago. Tilley cites concerns over the longer-term hit from tariffs that could depress consumer spending, which drove 68% of all economic activity in the first quarter, as well as business investment and hiring. "If consumers are shouldering the burden, they're spending more for imports and they will cut back on recreational spending, airlines, Disney trips, fun parks, hotels, all of that," he said. "The most likely outcome is still weaker economic growth in the second half of 2025 and early 2026 compared to 2024 and the first half of this year, but no recession," Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote following the jobs release Friday. "It is easy to see how very weak job growth and higher tariffs could cause consumers to cut back on their spending and businesses to cut back on their investment, pushing the economy into a recession." Goldman Sachs forecasts growth to be just 1% in the final two quarters due in part to slower consumer spending and "a sharp slowdown in real income growth that reflects weaker job growth, higher tariff-driven inflation, and reductions in transfer payments in [the fourth quarter] that were included in the recent fiscal bill." "Friday's payrolls report brings payroll growth closer in line with big data indicators of job gains and the broader growth dataset, both of which have slowed significantly in recent months. Trump himself pushed back hard against the July jobs report, firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he called the numbers "FAKED" and "RIGGED" in a Truth Social post. But absolutely that jobs number, if the revision turns out to be true, does suggest that there's less momentum than we thought," said Hassett, director of the National Economic Council who is thought to be a leading contender for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. "What are we doing with a national average 30-year mortgage rate still close to 7% in an economy growing at 1%?" veteran economist and strategist Jim Paulsen wrote in a Substack post. "To me, today's jobs report is what entering a recession looks like," Josh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, wrote after the Friday report.

President Donald Trump plans over the next several days to name replacements for two key vacancies, one to fill a spot on the Federal Reserve and other to replace the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Both spots opened up Friday — the Fed position through the surprise resignation of Governor Adriana Kugler, and the other from Trump's stunning decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As a Fed governor, Kugler was a permanent voter on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's key funds level used as a peg for interest rates across the U.S.

Article: Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced Friday she is stepping down from her role at the central bank, creating an important vacancy at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing for lower interest rates. In a letter addressed to Trump, Kugler, 55, did not state a reason for her decision to leave, only noting that she will be returning to Georgetown University as a professor in the fall. "I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market." Kugler's term was set to expire at the end of January 2026. Two of his prior appointments, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted against the decision at Wednesday's meeting to hold the Fed's key rate steady, instead indicating they wanted to lower. Fed Chair Jerome Powell wished Kugler well, saying "She brought impressive experience and academic insights to her work on the Board." Trump has said he would litmus test any potential nominees and would only support those in favor of lower interest rates.

"When you have health care and social assistance essentially doing the lifting on private payrolls growth [and] federal government and government both shedding jobs here where the local government had sort of previously helped on the June participation, you have to say that … there's a substantial part of it that is essentially frozen," Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CNBC.

"The labor market is deteriorating quickly." The weak report, including the dramatic revisions, could provide incentive for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it next meets in September. They need to adapt to a new cost structure, which means holding off on hiring." There were few signs of strength in the July jobs count, with gains coming primarily from health care, a sector that has continued to show strength in the post-Covid recovery. However, federal government employment continued to decline, down 12,000 for the month and 84,000 since its January peak, before Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began paring down the jobs rolls. And now the test we have is really to figure out, to what extent is this slowdown likely to persist and get us into a more troublesome position," Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC.

Article: Businesses breathed a sigh of relief in April when the country swerved initial plans for a 31% tariff, being handed an interim 10% duty along with most of the world. Another potential reprieve came as the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs told Reuters on Friday it understands the 39% tariff will not include the pharmaceutical sector, which is separately facing volatility from Trump's latest comments on drug pricing. Switzerland's federal council said it had "great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland." It added that it continued to seek a "negotiated solution" and was in contact with U.S. Manufacturing association Swissmem said a 39% tariff would hit the tech industry, exports and therefore the whole country "extremely hard," noting that every second franc brought into the economy was made from foreign trade. "This will lead to a weakening of the Swiss economy, the Swiss Franc and the Swiss equity market, particularly the all-important export sector." watch now The Swiss government needs to recognize that the time for "cherry picking, carve outs and special deals" is over, particularly for small, highly-exposed states, Wittmann added. Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that a 39% tariff rate would knock around 0.6% off Switzerland's GDP, or more with the inclusion of pharmaceuticals — but that he expected it to be negotiated down. watch now With the Swiss stock market closed for national day, indicators are instead feeding through other avenues such as the performance of London-listed Watches of Switzerland, which fell nearly 9% in morning deals. In a Friday note to clients, analysts at investment bank Jefferies cited the company, along with Richemont and Swatch Group, as among those that would take the biggest hits from the news, particularly relative to previous expectations. The rally has delivered challenges to the economy, which in May marked a return to deflation for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic — spurring the Swiss National Bank to cut interest rates to zero in June. 'I do not think it is the end' Rahul Sahgal, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" the tariff news was "very disappointing" after many rounds of negotiations with the U.S.

Article: That topped the Dow Jones estimate for 2.3% and helped reverse a decline of 0.5% for the first quarter that came largely due to a huge drop in imports, which subtract from the total, as well as weak consumer spending amid tariff concerns. "The consumer is hanging in there, but still on edge until the trade deals are done." The period reported Wednesday includes President Donald Trump's April 2 "liberation day" tariff announcement. "The anti Trump story has been that we're going to have a recession or a depression because of the tariffs, which are going to jack up prices and cause consumers to run for the exits" Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, said on CNBC.

Article: When the Federal Open Market Committee releases its interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon, the narrative is almost certain to look a lot like the June meeting, with little changed in the statement and officials again holding off on any cuts. The Fed has plenty to ruminate over when it comes to the economy, including the possibility that Trump's tariffs may not be having the inflationary impact that many economists feared. "They're not going to get anything if they ease, other than they'll look like they're knuckling under to the president," said Bill English, the Fed's former head of monetary affairs and now a professor at the Yale School of Management. "So I think their best policy for sure is just to look at the data, make their best judgment, make their policy decision and explain it as well as they can." Arguments for a cut Powell will have his hands full outlining the committee's position considering the likely opposition coming from Waller and Bowman. In the run-up to the meeting, both have argued for cutting, saying essentially that with the tariff pass-through to inflation not yet apparent and a labor market "on the edge" as Waller described it in a speech less than two weeks ago, it's time for the Fed to ease. "With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate," Waller said in the speech titled "The Case for Cutting Now." Those comments likely will resonate with Trump, though a CNBC poll of market experts and economists showed just 14% believe Waller will get the nomination to replace Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

Here the UK benefits from its major trading partner averting a recession which could have resulted in a decline in UK exports to the EU," he said in written comments. "If the US had proceeded with 30% tariffs against most EU goods, UK goods with a 10% tariff, which is paid by the US importer in most circumstances, could have appeared significantly more attractive," she said.

Article: President Donald Trump talks to the media as he meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (not pictured) at Trump Turnberry golf club on July 28, 2025 in Turnberry, Scotland. tariffs on incoming goods look to be settling in only slightly less than what President Donald Trump had threatened in April, but the difference has been enough to ease some of Wall Street's worst recession fears. With the U.S.-European Union trade deal over the weekend, it now appears that the effective tariff rate, or the net impact aside from the nominal level, will end up in the 15%-20% range. That's well above the low single-digit rate in place at the beginning of the year, but well off the feared 25% rate or worse that could have happened as a result of the April 2 announcement. Tariffs still a danger Commentary around Wall Street following the U.S-EU deal for 15% tariffs echoed the belief that the recession risk had dimmed, even if tariffs still have the strong potential to exert a stifling impact on growth. "We still believe the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation: Not a recession, but a backdrop where the adverse effects of trade and immigration controls on growth outweigh the boost from deregulation and fiscal largesse," Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Zezas wrote. economy skewing toward a slowdown, but with more clarity on the fiscal situation and deficits now front-loaded, the risk of a substantial recession is easing." The U.S.-Europe deal will give the Federal Reserve more to chew on this week when it discusses the impact that tariffs will have on inflation. Since Trump has taken office, the Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate steady, in large part because policymakers are cautious over the impact tariffs will have on inflation. The Fed is expected to approve a rate cut in September, and the chances of that happening seemingly would increase if the economy weakens while inflation is held in check. "But with major trading partner tariffs stabilizing closer to 15% than the much higher rates proposed on April 2, markets and Fed officials will be increasingly confident that the drag on growth and upside risk to inflation will be modest."

Article: "I got that to mean that I think he's going to start recommending lower rates." Powell and his fellow policymakers have been reluctant to lower rates as they wait to see the impact Trump's tariffs have on inflation. Prior to Trump's remarks, White House budget director Russell Vought kept up the heat on the Fed's renovation project, pushing the case for a review of the central bank while pressing for lower interest rates. "There's a whole host of issues with regard to the Fed, and we want to make sure that those questions get answered over time," Vought said during the "Squawk Box" appearance. "This is not a pressure campaign on the Fed chairman." The tone following Thursday's meeting was more conciliatory after months — and even years — of rancor between the Trump White House and the Powell Fed. Both sides characterized the tour as positive, with a Fed official releasing a statement Friday saying the central bank was "honored" to welcome Trump as well as other Republican officials.

Instead of relying on a single conveyor, the Detroit automaker will construct EVs on a three-pronged “assembly tree”—an innovation the company likened to the Model T, aka the world’s first mass-produced automobile. Ford will also invest $2 billion to retool a Kentucky plant that currently makes gas-powered cars, where it’ll use the manufacturing method to produce midsize EV pickup trucks priced at around $30,000 starting in 2027. Potential game changer Ford is betting the new production process—which was developed by a small Silicon Valley-based team led by Tesla veteran Alan Clarke—will save it time and money: The company says it’ll be 15% faster than its current assembly process, and will involve 20% fewer parts, as well as reduce physical strain for workers.

Article: The idea is simple: Rip up at least some of your grass-only lawn—which is like an empty buffet table for biodiversity—and replace it with an array of native plants, which creates a real smorgasbord. But amid a nationwide shortage of native seeds that stems from environmental restoration projects (like wildfire recovery), the anti-lawn movement is putting pressure on the landscaping industry: A nationwide shortage of native seeds is leading to delays, substitutions, and out-of-state imports in some landscaping projects as re-wilding demands rise faster than plant nurseries can nurse, Fast Company reported last week. Lawn companies are rethinking their supply chains: One LA-based landscaping architecture firm even opened its own plant store in an attempt to boost the local supply of native flora, per Fast Company. Some local governments are trying to help with availability—earlier this year, Ohio signed off on a new law that makes it easier for residents and grassroots groups collect and share native seeds, and New York greenlit a grant program to boost its own stash.—ML

Article: Death, taxes, and severely not chill homeowners associations: If you’re one of more than 75 million Americans living under an HOA, you may be caught between the rock and a hard place of neighborhood upkeep rules and local climate-conscious lawn ordinances. One extreme case: Irena Green of Florida had to spend a week in jail in May after minor HOA violations snowballed into a lawsuit, then into a warrant for her arrest. In Texas last summer, at least one resident was getting brown lawn warnings from her HOA while also receiving reminders from her utility company not to exceed water limits—both of which carried potential fines. Homegrown efforts to redo lawns so they need less water also haven’t gone over well—even when local governments encourage it: A Long Island village recently tried to sue one of its residents for $2,000 after she used her town’s $350 native plants grant to re-wild her yard, which the village mayor called “hideous.” (They compromised with a 4-foot cap on the garden’s height.) Clover and moss are becoming more popular as low-maintenance grass lawn alternatives, but HOAs usually categorize them as weeds that could warrant a fine.

Article: AI is the economy’s steroid Kedrosky estimates that AI spending already makes up a larger share of GDP than spending on telecom and internet infrastructure did during the dot-com bubble in 2000. While Wall Street seems bullish that Big Tech’s bet on AI is justified—especially with a recent rise in AI services and cloud revenues—some economists are worried that the boom could end in a bust. If AI doesn’t deliver the productivity gains its biggest boosters are hoping for, the Great Data Center Buildout could be a repeat of the early 20th-century railroad boom or the dot-com bubble, when tech optimists overestimated demand.

Article: President Trump signed an executive order yesterday instructing the Department of Labor to review its guidance on historically riskier investment markets, like private equity, real estate, and crypto, for employers and retirement plan administrators. An executive order won’t update your retirement account dashboard directly, but it will urge the Labor Department and other government agencies to make it easier for your nest egg to include alternative assets. Right now, no law prohibits employers and plan sponsors from offering these kinds of assets, but they are required to act as fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal and ethical duty to protect investors: Traditionally, plan sponsors have been extremely conservative about including anything that could get them sued, especially when it comes to deciding what investment options are available through your 401(k). Most of the groups advocating for these assets to be included in 401(k) investments are the ones that would benefit from gaining access to the roughly $12.2 trillion currently in retirement funds.

Article: On top of trying to restore a troubled chipmaker to its former glory, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan now has President Trump calling on him to step down over his connections to China. But his position is more sensitive than someone juggling friendships with two exes: Intel is a key Pentagon supplier and the biggest recipient of federal dollars from the Chips Act, which is meant to help the US compete with China in chipmaking: Cotton noted that when Tan served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, the company supplied a Chinese military university with semiconductor tech in violation of US export controls—which it pleaded guilty to last week. Also…Tan steering cash-strapped Intel to scale back its US manufacturing plans is not likely to please Trump, who this week announced plans for 100% semiconductor tariffs, with exemptions only for companies investing in US-based production.—SK

Then, instead of Apple shifting its supply chain to the US—a Trump administration goal that Apple has called a non-starter—the company moved much of its manufacturing operations from China to India: Thanks to that move, India has overtaken China as the top smartphone exporter to the US for the first time ever, the research firm Canalys reported last week. Scoring another exemption this time around could save Apple (and its customers) serious cash, especially in light of an additional tariff against India Trump announced yesterday: Imports from India will face an additional 25% levy—bringing the total to 50%—to punish the country for buying Russian oil, Trump announced before Cook stopped by the White House. In January, a group backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced its intention to spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years…but the venture has struggled to close a single data center deal and is now scaling back its goals, the Wall Street Journal recently reported.—ML

Article: President Trump alleged that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America—the two biggest banks in the US—refused to handle more than $1 billion of his money after his first term, the president said in an interview with CNBC yesterday. Per the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s claims could serve as the catalyst for an executive order as early as this week designed to punish the banking industry for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. Reputational risk Per Reuters, during the Biden administration, regulators were able to ask banks why they were providing services to Trump in spite of the “reputational risk” issue, which is a way for banks to turn away customers or entities who could hurt the bank’s image. Thus, this is one area where Trump and the banks now appear aligned: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Trump is “after the right thing, which is the laws, rules, and regulations around our industry.” Zoom out: While banks legally can’t say “your money is no good here” because of political affiliation, they can say it if, for instance, someone has been convicted of fraud.

As of 2021, at least 17 states explicitly banned automakers from selling their own vehicles: The rules stem from concerns about automotive giants like Ford and GM gaining too much power through vertical monopolies. Ohio is just one battleground…with Tesla having successfully lobbied state lawmakers across the country to pass laws allowing it to sell directly to customers or use workarounds like operating showrooms but making customers order cars online.

Article: Like a straight-A student living the nightmare that their teacher called their parents to say they’re on the verge of failing math, famously conflict-avoidant Switzerland is racing against the clock to get out of the fight President Trump picked with the country last week. The trade barrier—which one Swiss newspaper called the country’s biggest defeat since France beat it in the Battle of Marignano in 1515—came after a phone call between Trump and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter last week. The country’s leaders are now getting flak for bungling talks and are working to change Trump’s mind before the new tariff rate is slated to kick in on August 7. Switzerland’s claim to fame as a top-shelf goods supplier is what made it a target for some of Trump’s heaviest tariffs: The land of bougie chocolate and watches has the 13th-largest annual trade surplus with the US, amounting to $38 billion last year. Though a chunk of that comes from Swiss gold exports (the country is a major transit point for the precious metal), some local business leaders blamed the country’s pharma giants for inspiring Trump’s ire. Even though pharma is currently exempt from the import duty, Switzerland-based Novartis and Roche’s US subsidiary Genentech were among the major pharma purveyors that POTUS recently gave 60 days to lower drug prices. But Switzerland’s business minister Guy Parmelin said the country could try to win Trump over by offering to buy more American liquefied natural gas or ramping up investments in the US economy.—SK

Article: Last night, with a self-imposed midnight deadline looming for the end of the tariff pause, meaning countries that hadn’t reached a new trade deal with the US would get turned into a pumpkin slapped with higher tariffs, President Trump rolled out new tariffs to be imposed on imports from dozens of countries—but pushed off their implementation until Aug. A senior US official told Bloomberg that the rates fell into roughly three groups: 10% for countries where the US has a trade surplus, 15% for those where the US has a small trade deficit, and higher for countries with a large deficit or that didn’t strike deals: For countries that did make deals–including Japan, Britain, the EU, Indonesia, and South Korea—the order appears to reflect the tariffs that were agreed to, even though the details are still being worked out. Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada to 35% from 25%, but that this would exclude any goods covered by the trade deal he brokered with Canada and Mexico during his first term. There’s no getting around them: The order imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods deemed “transhipped,” which means made in one country with components from another to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile…a federal appeals court appeared skeptical yesterday of Trump’s legal power to set tariffs without congressional approval while hearing the Justice Department’s appeal of a federal trade court’s May ruling that struck down the tariffs (but was then halted).

Article: Trump ordered a takeover of Washington’s police President Trump said yesterday that he was temporarily taking control of the police force in Washington and deploying 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in the U.S. During a news conference, the president painted a dystopian picture of Washington, a city that he said had been taken over by “bloodthirsty criminals” and “roving mobs of wild youth.” His remarks contrasted with official figures showing that violent crime in the city had hit a 30-year low. Trump added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” Trump has been threatening to take federal control of Washington for weeks, but he has railed against crime in largely liberal cities for decades. The Washington deployment is the latest example of Trump’s use of the military to achieve his domestic goals; earlier this year, he sent 4,700 National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles and deployed about 10,000 troops to the U.S.

Article: Ukraine and its European backers insist that the United States and Russia cannot decide on land swaps behind their backs at a summit this week in Alaska German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, left, and the head of the Chancellery Thorsten Frei talk during a cabinet meeting at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025, (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, left, and the head of the Chancellery Thorsten Frei talk during a cabinet meeting at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025, (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) BRUSSELS -- Ukraine and its backers in Europe insist that the United States and Russia cannot decide on land swaps behind their backs at a summit this week, but the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds. “As we work towards a sustainable and just peace, international law is clear: All temporarily occupied territories belong to Ukraine,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on the eve of the ministerial meeting. On Sunday, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Germany cannot accept that territorial issues in Ukraine would be discussed or decided by Russia and the United States “over the heads” of Europeans or Ukrainians. “In the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling at this moment, factually, a part of Ukraine has to be on the table" in any peace talks after the Alaska summit, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on CBS on Sunday. hosted the diplomatic missions of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 1940 to 1991, “acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting (it) in a legal sense.” Giving up claim to any territory, especially without a ceasefire agreement first, would be almost impossible for Zelenskyy to sell at home after thousands of troops have died defending their land. Ultimately, Putin is seen as being not so much interested in land itself, but rather in a more “Russia-friendly” Ukraine with a malleable government that would be unlikely to try to join NATO, just as pro-Russian regions in Georgia stymied that country's hopes of becoming a member.

Article: Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald ... WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded. Yet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Matt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.

Article: Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know By ISABEL DEBRE Associated Press and PAOLA FLORES Associated Press Bolivian presidential candidate Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga attends his campaign rally ahead of the upcoming presidential election, in La Paz, Bolivia, Thursday, Aug. Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth. In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin. The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president — both of whom have run and lost three times before — and a young leftist Senate leader. “The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers. “But the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,” Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom. A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia’s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term. Dubbed the “eternal candidate,” he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia’s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader's popularity. Now once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size. “These are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization." Doria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation's foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising “No more lines!” If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales.

Article: Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers have been heading home from Thailand as the two countries seek to keep a ceasefire in armed clashes on their border Shuttles packed to the brim with Cambodian migrant workers and their belongings drive away from the Daung International Border Check Point between Cambodia and Thailand, in in Kamrieng, on Wednesday, Aug. Delgado) Shuttles packed to the brim with Cambodian migrant workers and their belongings drive away from the Daung International Border Check Point between Cambodia and Thailand, in in Kamrieng, on Wednesday, Aug. Delgado) KAMRIENG, Cambodia -- Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers have been heading home from Thailand as the two countries work to keep a ceasefire in armed clashes along their border. The retreat has left many of the workers streaming back to Cambodia wondering how to get by after they left jobs that enabled them to send money back to their families. “I have no idea if the fighting will really stop and with fewer and fewer Cambodians in Thailand, I got nervous,” said Kri Phart, seated on a stoop with two big bags of belongings and a big electric fan. “I didn’t want to be the last Cambodian migrant in Thailand.” “I got scared because of the border conflict,” said Kri Phart, one of thousands of Cambodians streaming shoulder-to-shoulder through the Daung International Border Gate last week, hauling rainbow colored bags, appliances and even guitars in the 40 Celsius (104 F) heat. “Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents. Handing over her belongings to be strapped into the back of a precariously packed van, Thouk Houy said the clincher was a claim by influential former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet, that Thailand was preparing to invade. The loss of that income can be devastating for families relying on it to manage big debts, said Nathan Green, an assistant professor of geography at the National University of Singapore. “We are talking about the poorest of the poor, who will be deprived of incomes.” Meng Yeam, who was trying to wave down a taxi while keeping an eye on his belongings, said he managed to send his family back home 20,000 baht (roughly $600) while working as a manager at a rubber factory in eastern Thailand’s Chonburi Province. “I hope we can work in Thailand again one day, but who knows, maybe I will be retired by the time we stop fighting.” ___ Sopheng Cheang reported from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Article: Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes: The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement. Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Article: To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an x-ray, an ultrasound machine, and a bone density scanner -- all owned by the town. "This is important for our community," said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, "in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important." According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents. Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians -- including 6,000 primary care doctors -- by 2035. "This is a huge, huge issue," said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. "It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community." In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here. "It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends." Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said. "We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last 3 to 5 years than we ever heard before," he said, "and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on." Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. He was kind of a different kind of physician." Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a 3-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June. Camron Browning, MD, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist. "My goal," he said, "was to be able to come home and serve my hometown." Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice. After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency. "This was always my dream."

Article: Australia's central bank said on Wednesday that monetary policy was restrictive with the current cash rate causing financial pain for many households, but it could not rule out further tightening if necessary to tame inflation. Australia's central bank cut its policy rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday, as low inflation allows the country room to loosen its monetary policy and boost its slowing economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia said that inflation had dropped "substantially" since the peak in 2022, with steeper interest rates bringing aggregate demand and potential supply "closer towards balance." Inflation in Australia came in at 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest since March 2021 and near the end of the RBA's 2%-3% range. The CBA analysts are also forecasting an additional cut for November, and also see the possibility of one more in "early 2026." — This is breaking news, please check back for updates.

Article: NEW YORK — Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl." The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter made the announcement early Tuesday in a short clip from her upcoming appearance on New Heights, the podcast hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason, on a new episode that will premiere Wednesday.

Article: Colombian senator and presidential hopeful dies 2 months after shooting toggle caption Fernando Vergara/AP BOGOTA, Colombia — A Colombian senator and presidential hopeful whose shooting at a political rally in June recalled some of the darkest chapters of the country's drug-fueled violence died Monday. Uribe, 39, was shot three times, twice in the head, while giving a campaign speech in a park and had since remained in an intensive care unit in serious condition with episodes of slight improvement. "I ask God to show me the way to learn to live without you." Sponsor Message A teenage suspect was arrested at the scene of the June 7 attack in a working-class Bogota neighborhood. The shooting, which was caught on multiple videos, alarmed Colombians who have not seen this kind of political violence against presidential candidates since Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar declared war on the state in the 1990s. "If my mother was willing to give her life for a cause, how could I not do the same in life and in politics?" Uribe, who was just 5 when his mother was killed, said in an interview last year with a Colombian news outlet. We have not persecuted any member of the opposition, nor will we." In the immediate aftermath of the attack, tens of thousands of people dressed in white and waving Colombian flags took to the streets to reject the violence. By declaring his aspirations to higher office, Uribe sought to become the country's youngest president, although he was not on the list of favorites in the early stages of the race when he was shot. Javier Garay, a political science professor at the Externado University of Colombia, said Uribe has already "become a symbol of the Colombian right." However, he considered it premature to predict whether the senator's death will strengthen the political faction, given the current lack of unity and diverse proposals from dozens of politicians vying to represent the bloc on next year's ballot.

Article: Sheila Jordan, who never achieved the name recognition of a Billie Holiday or Sarah Vaughan but who came to be recognized as one of the great singers in jazz, died on Monday in New York City. Her first album under her own name, “Portrait of Sheila,” arrived relatively late in her career, in 1963, when she was 34, but its release on the Rolls-Royce of jazz record labels, Blue Note — which had never before recorded a singer, by policy — heralded an important new voice in jazz.

Article: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said that Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, is “in denial” about the suffering inflicted on Gaza, and the international community is now saying, “Enough is enough”. A day after announcing that Australia will recognise Palestinian statehood at the United Nations next month, Albanese said that frustration with the Israeli government amid the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza had contributed to Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state. “[Netanyahu] again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,” Albanese said in an interview with state broadcaster ABC on Tuesday. Albanese said he spoke with Netanyahu last week to inform him of Australia’s decision to join France, Canada and the United Kingdom in recognising a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly meeting in September. Netanyahu, he said, continued to make the same arguments he made last year regarding the conduct of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has now killed more than 61,500 Palestinians since October 2023. “That if we just have more military action in Gaza, somehow that will produce a different outcome,” Albanese said, recounting his call with the Israeli leader, according to ABC News. Advertisement “The toll of the status quo is growing by the day, and it could be measured in innocent lives,” Albanese said, adding the decision was made as part of a “coordinated global effort” on the two-state solution, which he had discussed with the leaders of the UK, France, New Zealand and Japan. “A two-state solution is humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,” he said. Albanese had said just last month that he would not be drawn on a timeline for recognition of a Palestinian state, and has previously been wary of a public opinion backlash in Australia, which has significant Jewish and Muslim minorities. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched across Sydney’s Harbour Bridge this month, calling for aid deliveries to be allowed to enter Gaza as the humanitarian crisis worsens and Israel’s military continues to block relief efforts. Israel also plans to take military control of Gaza City, risking the lives of more than a million Palestinians and instigating what a senior UN official said would be “another calamity”, as deaths from starvation and malnutrition continue to grow across the enclave. “This decision is driven by popular sentiment in Australia, which has shifted in recent months, with a majority of Australians wanting to see an imminent end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” Jessica Genauer, a senior lecturer in international relations at Flinders University, told the Reuters news agency.

Article: over the Panama Canal toggle caption Matias Delacroix/AP UNITED NATIONS — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." Sponsor Message U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security.

"I’m running to serve as Tennessee’s next governor to ensure Tennessee is America’s conservative leader." Rose, who announced his bid for governor in March, likewise has voiced strong support for Trump in a state that Trump has easily won in the past three presidential elections.

Patients have told File on 4 Investigates how they were left immobile or addicted to painkillers after receiving the NexGen knee implant, because it ended up slipping out of place. It took me a long time to come off of the morphine because I was addicted." She has since had a second knee replacement, but the problems caused by the initial failed implant have caused long-lasting health problems, she says. However, File on 4 Investigates has discovered that concerns were first flagged in 2014 by the National Joint Registry (NJR) which keeps a record of implant surgery across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. "You spend a lifetime building up a career and a reputation, and it's very easy to have that career shredded." When he raised questions with Zimmer Biomet representatives, they assured him there wasn't a widespread problem, he says - an account echoed by NHS surgeons who told us they had found themselves in similar situations. Prof Eric Masterson said the failure rate of the implant started to impact his career and reputation Prof Masterson asked to be put in touch with surgeons in the UK to compare notes. However, confidential internal company documents seen by File on 4 Investigates reveal the company was only willing to contact surgeons on his behalf if they were considered "friends of Zimmer Biomet" and "happy with their NexGen patients".

Article: Nepal offers free climbs to 97 peaks as tourism to Everest surges Climbing fees brought in $5.9m for Nepal last year, with Everest accounting for more than three quarters of that Mountaineering generates a significant source of revenue for Nepal, which is home to the world's 10 tallest mountains. It comes as permit fees to summit Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, during peak season will go up to $15,000 (£11,170) from September - the first increase in nearly a decade. In April 2024, Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to limit the number of mountaineering permits issued for Everest and several other peaks, saying that the mountains' capacity "must be respected". For those attempting the summit outside the peak April to May season, it will now cost $7,500 to climb Everest during September to November and $3,750 during December to February.

Article: North Koreans tell BBC they are being sent to work 'like slaves' in Russia 8 minutes ago Share Save Jean Mackenzie Seoul correspondent Share Save BBC The BBC understands more than 50,000 North Koreans will eventually be sent to work in Russia Thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in slave-like conditions in Russia to fill a huge labour shortage exacerbated by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the BBC has learned. Now, with many of Russia's men either killed or tied up fighting - or having fled the country - South Korean intelligence officials have told the BBC that Moscow is increasingly relying on North Korean labourers. One of the workers, Jin, told the BBC that when he landed in Russia's Far East, he was chaperoned from the airport to a construction site by a North Korean security agent, who ordered him not to talk to anyone or look at anything. All six workers we spoke to described the same punishing workdays – waking at 6am and being forced to build high-rise apartments until 2am the next morning, with just two days off a year. Getty Images Kim Jong Un has sent Vladimir Putin weapons and soldiers to fight his war in Ukraine "Waking up was terrifying, realising you had to repeat the same day over again," said another construction worker, Tae, who managed to escape Russia last year. At night the lights are turned out and they work in the dark, with little safety equipment." The escapees told us that the workers are confined to their construction sites day and night, where they are watched by agents from North Korea's state security department. In the past, tens of thousands of North Koreans worked in Russia earning millions of pounds a year for the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, and his cash-strapped regime. Then in 2019, the UN banned countries from using these workers in an attempt to cut off Kim's funds and stop him building nuclear weapons, meaning most were sent home. While most are working on large-scale construction projects, others have been assigned to clothing factories and IT centres, they said, in violation of the UN sanctions banning the use of North Korean labour. In June, a senior Russian official, Sergei Shoigu, admitted for the first time that 5,000 North Koreans would be sent to rebuild Kursk, a Russian region seized by Ukrainian forces last year but who have since been pushed back. KCNA These flowers were sent to Kim Jong Un by various Russian construction companies in April, according to North Korean state media These overseas construction jobs are highly coveted in North Korea as they promise to pay better than the work at home.

Article: While indications are growing that the tragedy is starting to register among Israelis, the willful blindness of much of Israeli society must be discarded for Israel to begin pulling itself out of the quagmire in Gaza and repairing its own tattered image. But it is also important to understand the powerful underlying emotions that have led many Israelis to close their eyes and ears to the suffering of Gazans and accept a different version of reality. There is a profound sense of unfairness over demands that Israel allow large transfers of aid to Gaza when many returning hostages describe being starved and abused even when there seemed to be enough food for their captors. It includes the 2005 disengagement of Israel from Gaza, followed by Hamas’s 2007 takeover, and nearly two decades of cyclical attempts to deter and contain the organization with limited military operations and economic carrots, like permits for Gazans to work in Israel. 7, combined with the cheering chorus from enemies and the silence from many friends, hardened the conflict for many Israelis to the fundamental, zero-sum and inherently violent struggle for land and sovereignty that so many of the kibbutzniks murdered in their homes that day had sought to overcome with their peaceful intentions.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) President Donald Trump, right, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino carry the championship trophy at the conclusion of the Club World Cup final soccer match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, July 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) ATLANTA -- Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America. It's not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar’s scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers’ lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034. “The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they’ve stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA’s human rights work for 2026. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.” Miami-Dade officials referred The Associated Press to the local host committee, which did not respond to requests for comment. More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. It’s not about human rights in any meaningful way.” FIFA’s human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men’s 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations’ guiding principles.” A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia. In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights" seriously and she wouldn’t be participating in the effort if she didn’t think that was possible. Candace Stanciel, Atlanta’s chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. The International Labour Organization called FIFA’s human rights framework "an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.

Article: The President of the Government, Pedro Sanchez, gives a press conference, after a meeting with King Felipe VI, at the Marivent Palace, on 29 July, 2025 in Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. "Spain is an interesting case in Europe because it is really the only country that is openly antagonizing Trump whereas everybody is trying to keep their head down for the most part," Federico Santi, a senior analyst focused on southern Europe at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by video call. A flight deck crew signal to F-35 jet on USS George Washington during Freedom Edge trilateral exercise among United States, Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea, south of the Korean peninsula and west of Japan's main islands November 14, 2024. Kim Kyung-hoon | Reuters The opportunity to focus on big-ticket foreign policy issues such as defense, Eurasia Group's Santi said, could help Sanchez to distract the public from his own domestic woes. So, unlike the South Africa's or Brazil's of the world that faced a very direct backlash from Trump in the form of higher tariffs, they are somewhat shielded from that," Santi said. Trump's NATO outburst Spain's defense ministry said last week that it was no longer considering the option of buying U.S.-made F-35s, Reuters reported, preferring instead to replace its ageing fighter jet fleet with European military aircraft. The decision to snub Lockheed Martin 's fighter jets came after Trump said it was "terrible" that Madrid wouldn't commit to the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. Brian Snyder | Reuters Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands in late June, Trump said the Spanish economy "could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening." The U.S. Ignacio Molina, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank in Madrid, said Spain's geographic distance from Russia and the distinct features of its foreign policy stretching back to its last war in 1898, which was against the U.S., means that Madrid views its relationship with Washington as "less vital" than other EU countries. Even with regard to Ukraine (whom Spain strongly supports) Spain's main focus is on its EU accession bid and the reception of refugees, not on its NATO membership or arms deliveries," Molina told CNBC by email. The Spanish Navy's Juan Carlos I (L 61) amphibious assault ship seen during NATO's largest annual maritime drill, Exercise Dynamic Mariner / Flotex 25, continues in the Gulf of Cadiz off southern Spain on March 28, 2025.

Article: lawmakers from both parties are urging the Trump administration to maintain a three-way security partnership designed to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines — a plea that comes as the Pentagon reviews the agreement and considers the questions it has raised about the American industrial infrastructure's shipbuilding capabilities. “This is getting back to restoring our defense industrial capacity so that we don’t have to face these awful choices but rather can be in a position where we can produce not only for ourselves, but for our allies." As part of the $269 billion AUKUS partnership, the United States will sell three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, with the first delivery scheduled as soon as 2032. “The delivery pace is not where it needs to be" to make good on the first pillar of AUKUS, Admiral Daryl Caudle, nominee for the Chief of Naval Operations, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. production rates and maintenance to enable the delivery of Australia’s future Virginia-class submarines.” The three nations have also jointly tested communication capabilities with underwater autonomous systems, Australia's defense ministry said on July 23. At the recent Aspen Security Forum, Kevin Rudd, the Australian ambassador to the United States, said his country is committed to increasing defense spending to support its first nuclear-powered sub program, which would also provide “massively expensive full maintenance repair facilities" for the U.S. Rudd expressed confidence that the two governments “will work our way through this stuff.” Bruce Jones, senior fellow with the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy and Technology, told The Associated Press that the partnership, by positioning subs in Western Australia, is helping arm the undersea space that is “really crucial to American deterrence and defense options in the Western Pacific.” “The right answer is not to be content with the current pace of submarine building. “This is not a deal that just benefits Australia." Defense policy is one of the few areas where Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the Trump administration, but their resolve is being tested with the Pentagon’s review of AUKUS. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told the AP that support for AUKUS is strong and bipartisan, “certainly on the Armed Services Committee.” "There is a little bit of mystification about the analysis done at the Pentagon,” Kaine said, adding that “maybe (what) the analysis will say is: We believe this is a good thing.”

Article: -- The Milwaukee area began drying out Monday after weekend rain hit unofficial records in Wisconsin of more than 14 inches (36 centimeters) in less than 24 hours, leading multiple rivers to flood at record-high levels, washing out vehicles, flooding basements and cutting power to thousands of homes. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency after touring some of the damage in suburban Wauwatosa on Monday and called the flooding “unprecedented.” Rob Sieracki lives across the street from a dog park that he said was completely underwater. "Some water did come in, it’s stinky water, we think it’s sewage, but we’ll be OK.” The flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis outside of Milwaukee on Sunday, as well as USA Triathlon’s Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he’s hearing stories of residents across the city, including his own uncle, who had water all the way up to the top of their basement. Unofficial two-day rain totals in the 10- to 12-inch range, with one reading exceeding more than 14 inches (about 35.6 centimeters) in northwestern Milwaukee County, would set record highs for the state once verified over the coming weeks, Marquardt said. A teenager clinging to a tree branch and standing on a submerged log was rescued by firefighters in an inflatable boat on Sunday afternoon after getting swept away as the Root River flooded a road in Franklin, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southwest of Milwaukee.

The designation of the Balochistan Liberation Army and its fighting wing, the Majeed Brigade, blamed for deadly attacks in insurgency-hit Balochistan province, coincides with the visit of Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, to the U.S. It also comes less than two weeks after Washington and Islamabad reached a trade agreement expected to allow American firms to help develop Pakistan’s largely untapped oil reserves in resource-rich Balochistan and to lower trade tariffs for Islamabad. In a statement, the State Department said it is “designating the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and adding the Majeed Brigade as an alias to BLA’s previous Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) designation.” The BLA was first designated an SDGT in 2019 after several terrorist attacks. In 2025, the group said it carried out the hijacking of the Jaffar Express train traveling from Quetta to Peshawar, killing 31 civilians and security personnel and holding more than 300 passengers hostage, according to the U.S. Separatists in Balochistan have opposed the extraction of resources by Pakistani and foreign firms and have targeted Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Article: President Donald Trump to defend their security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine FILE - President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to cow the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. In a statement early on Tuesday, the leaders said that they “welcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.” But, they underlined, “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” “A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force,” they said.

Article: President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia’s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation’s capital FILE - President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has taken control of the District of Columbia's law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation's capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are in response to an urgent public safety crisis. Even as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the president promised a "historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse." His rhetoric echoed that used by conservative politicians going back decades who have denounced American cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressive politicians, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action. Communities had been preparing for a potential federal crackdown in the district since the summer of 2020, when Trump deployed National Guard troops during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd. “The president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations — from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,” Hopkins said. Conservative lawmakers have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major American cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. President Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a "law and order" agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his “Southern Strategy.” Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians ranging from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from cities like Washington for decades. The mayor kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference following Trump’s announcement but decried the president’s reasoning as a “so-called emergency” and said the district’s residents “know that access to our democracy is tenuous.” Trump threatened to “take over” and “beautify” the nation’s capital on the campaign trail and claimed the district was “a nightmare of murder and crime.” He also argued the city was “horribly run” and said his team intended “to take it away from the mayor.” The president repeated comments he’d previously made about some of the nation’s largest cities during his news conference, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and his hometown of New York City. The president’s rhetoric "paints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people’s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,” Wiley said. She added that the playbook has special potency in the capital because the district’s local law enforcement can be directly placed under federal control, a power Trump invoked in his announcement. Wes Moore said Trump’s plan “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous” in a statement and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump's characterization of the city “fearmongering.” The administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles despite opposition from California Gov.

Article: (AP Photo/Alex Brandon), File) ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump has endorsed Burt Jones' Republican bid for governor in Georgia, a boost to the incumbent lieutenant governor's effort to set himself up as the 2026 frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Trump announced the nod Monday, noting that Jones was among the first Georgia Republicans to endorse Trump's first bid for the White House in 2016 and saying Jones “worked tirelessly to help us win” in all three of Trump's bids. “I know his family well and have seen Burt tested at the most difficult levels and times.” Republicans including Attorney General Chris Carr are vying with Jones to be their party's nominee to succeed Gov. “For Burt Jones, fealty to extreme, partisan politics has always trumped doing what’s right for Georgia — and that’s why this endorsement shouldn’t surprise anyone,” Democratic Governors Association spokesperson Kevin Donohoe said in a statement. Jones was one of 16 state Republicans who signed certificates stating that Trump had won Georgia in 2020 and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors even though Democrat Joe Biden had been declared the state’s winner.

(Kim Min-Hee/Pool Photo via AP, File) FILE - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung delivers a speech during a news conference to mark his first 30 days in office at Yeongbingwan of Blue House in Seoul, South Korea, July 3, 2025. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country’s top export to the United States. Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump’s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs. Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies’ defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a “future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance” to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn’t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East. “What’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger against DPRK — that we might have the flexibility as we modernize our alliance so that we could go do other things,” Brunson said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. They met three times in 2018 and 2019 but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North’s steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. Kim’s powerful sister recently dismissed Washington and Seoul’s stated desires to restart diplomacy aimed at defusing the North’s nuclear program, indicating that Pyongyang feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. North Korea labels the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.

Article: (AP Photo/Jessie Alcheh) A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island’s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants’ misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.” Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training." The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable." “This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project," the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani’s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.” The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.” Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga) TAITA TAVETA, Kenya -- For farmers in the Taita hills in southern Kenya, elephants are a menace: they raid crops and will occasionally injure or even kill people. “The places and infrastructure that we humans develop hinder the migratory routes and paths which elephants used to take,” explains Yuka Luvonga, who researches human-elephant coexistence for conservation organization Save The Elephants. “They will try touching a fence, and once they realize that it is not electrified, they charge through.” If farmers try to chase them off, as Shika did, the elephants will sometimes turn and defend themselves. “Over the years, the elephants have become too destructive.” Farming practices that deter elephants – like beekeeping and growing sesame – have made coexistence much easier for farmers like Shika and Jackim. “We have to live harmoniously with these elephants,” says Yuka Luvonga from Save the Elephants, “and to create awareness and sensitize the communities to change their attitudes towards the animals that we have.” Only then can both people and elephants here continue to thrive.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) The Justice Department identified some three dozen states, cities and counties as so-called sanctuary jurisdictions on Tuesday, two months after the federal government quietly removed a much longer list that included many localities that support the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Attorney General Pamela Bondi warned in the announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.” “Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” she said. The new list is composed overwhelmingly of Democratic jurisdictions, including states like New York, California and Connecticut, cities like Boston and New York City and a handful of counties, including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois. The administration never fully explained the errors in the first announcement, which included hundreds of jurisdictions, including places that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump and at least one that had declared itself a “non-sanctuary city.” The list was published in late May on the Department of Homeland Security's website but within three days was replaced with a “Page Not Found” error message. The administration has filed a series of lawsuits targeting state or city policies it says are interfering with immigration enforcement, including those in Los Angeles, New York City, Denver and Rochester, New York.

Article: and China agreed to extend the tariff truce for another 90 days — major sticking points are holding up a deal, and both sides are planning a leaders' summit later this year to break the impasse. Reaching a durable deal, however, will be a feat that requires prolonged and contested "bargaining-like negotiations," said Xinbo Wu, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. "The tariff extension was necessary for trade negotiations to continue while [the] planning for a possible summit continues through diplomatic channels," said Jeff Moon, president at consultancy China Moon Strategies and a former assistant U.S. and China may eventually sign a final trade deal, it may not address issues central to the trade war — namely, China's industrial overcapacity, which is driven by heavy state subsidies, Moon said. The Chinese Ministry of Finance said in a notice that both countries will continue to pause 24% tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days while retaining a 10% levy. In separate statements, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it would extend the suspension of restrictions on companies targeted in its unreliable entity list and export control list for another 90 days. In May, the two sides agreed to a 90-day tariff truce that rolled back the prohibitive 145% duties in April and paused other punitive measures, allowing negotiators more time to pursue a lasting deal. Tech export controls Technology export controls have been top of the agenda in bilateral talks, as Trump struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD to share part of their revenue from sales to China in exchange for permissions to sell to the country. Trump has undercut a tool that limited China's ability to compete with the United States in artificial intelligence and other new technologies," Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and former head of IMF's China division, said in a recent commentary for The New York Times. Critical minerals The leverage that Beijing wields through its dominance of rare earths could be another factor that pushes Trump to offer concessions, including those on export controls, according to experts. China's grip on rare earths is seen as a key reason behind the recent easing of restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip exports to the country, according to Paul Triolo, partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, who expects Beijing to press for broader tech relaxations in upcoming negotiations. in June and moved to expedite licensing process after a series of negotiations, although few details were made available about its commitment to speeding up shipments of the critical minerals.

Article: Four reactor units at one of France’s largest nuclear power stations have been forced to shut down due to a swarm of jellyfish in the plant’s water pumping stations, French energy group Electricite de France (EDF) said. Three reactor units were automatically shut down on Sunday evening at Gravelines on the English Channel, followed by the fourth early on Monday morning, EDF said, adding that the safety of the plant, its employees and the environment was not at risk. The beaches around Gravelines, between the major cities of Dunkirk and Calais, have seen an increase in jellyfish in recent years due to warming waters and the introduction of invasive species. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists wrote in 2021 that jellyfish swarms incapacitating nuclear power plants is “neither new nor unknown” and there was substantial economic cost due to the forced closure of power plants. Advertisement “Jellyfish breed faster when water is warmer, and because areas like the North Sea are becoming warmer, the reproductive window is getting wider and wider,” Derek Wright, marine biology consultant with the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the Reuters news agency. EDF said it did not know the species of jellyfish involved in the shutdown, but this is not the first time jellyfish have shut down a nuclear facility, though such incidents were “quite rare” – the last effect on EDF operations was in the 1990s. There have been cases of plants in other countries shutting down due to jellyfish invasions, notably a three-day closure in Sweden in 2013 and a 1999 incident in Japan that caused a major drop in power output.

Instead, the NBC Select editor-favorite service is a grocery delivery method that offers a lot of the same benefits and customizations as other meal kits on this list — you take an initial quiz on your preferences and dietary needs, and Hungryroot creates a personalized grocery plan. With the ability to choose the type of meal you want (breakfast, lunch or dinner) and to customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot essentially “allows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,” says Leonard. Pricing The price of meal kit delivery services varies based on several factors, including the quality of meals and ingredients you’re getting, the frequency of your deliveries, how many people you’re cooking for and the meal plan you choose. More budget-friendly services like EveryPlate and Dinnerly will typically cost around $5 per serving, while most other popular services like HelloFresh will cost anywhere between $8 and $11 per serving. If you’re choosing a plan that sends you all the ingredients, you should be prepared to take the time needed to prepare each dish, says Christine Wansleben, owner and culinary director at Mise En Place, which offers cooking classes, private events and more. “That said, for special diets that are usually choice-based, such as veganism or low carb, I think these services are an excellent choice.” Delivery dates and times Before committing to a specific plan, you should consider when you’ll be able to receive these meals to avoid ingredients spoiling or not getting delivered, according to Resnick.

Lula’s office said the two leaders agreed on the role of the Group of 20 and BRICS in “defending multilateralism”, discussed efforts to negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine, and committed to expanding cooperation to sectors such as health, oil and gas, the digital economy and satellites.

Ethan Guo, 19, is alleged to have illegally landed his plane in Chilean territory after embarking on a solo trip to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research, according to local authorities. Mr Guo made headlines last year when he began an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and collect donations for research into childhood cancer. Having already visited six of seven continents, in June he flew his small Cessna 182Q aircraft from the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, to King George island off the Atlantic coast, which is claimed by Chile and named after the UK's King George III. "I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission." Mr Guo has been staying at a military base on the island for the last six weeks, AP reported. Mr Guo is hoping to become the first pilot to complete solo flights across all seven continents in the Cessna aircraft, and has already spent 140 days in the air on his travels.

Article: Israeli airstrike kills a prominent Al Jazeera journalist and colleagues in Gaza toggle caption Anas Baba/NPR GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Journalists cried out in disbelief Sunday night as they stepped into a press tent in Gaza City that had been hit in an Israeli airstrike targeting the territory's most prominent and well-recognized journalist, Anas al-Sharif. In all, six Palestinians journalists were killed in that attack, five of them reporting for Al Jazeera: Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qraiqea, Ibrahim al-Thaher, Mohamed Nofal, and freelance reporter Mohammed al-Khaldi. The attack on the journalists, and al-Sharif in particular, was roundly condemned by groups representing journalists, even as Israel's Arabic military spokesman shared what he said was proof that the correspondent was a Hamas cell commander- an allegation first levied last year. A video recorded on a journalist's phone shows the immediate aftermath of the attack, with 28-year-old al-Sharif's lifeless and bloodied body lying on the ground next to the maimed bodies of his colleagues. His boyish face and neatly combed hair belied the raw force of his live broadcasts in besieged areas of northern Gaza, under bombardment by Israeli fighter jets, or among the rain-flooded tents of displaced families, and in damaged hospitals and school shelters. Sponsor Message Al Jazeera questioned the timing of the attack on al-Sharif and his colleagues, which comes just as Israel plans a sweeping invasion of Gaza City in an effort to take control and occupy it. "The order to assassinate Anas al-Sharif, one of Gaza's bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza," the Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement. The military published digital graphics of documents it says show al-Sharif was a quote "terrorist within the ranks of Hamas." The military declined to answer NPR's questions on why al-Sharif was killed now- 10 months after Israel first levied accusations against him. "This is part of a pattern that we've seen from Israel in which Israel alleges that journalists are terrorists and then fails to produce any real credible evidence," CPJ's chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg, told NPR after Israel first made allegations against al-Sharif and other Al Jazeera journalists last October: She says smearing local journalists is a feature of what authoritarian regimes do to cast doubt on the reporting. These scenes brought the father of two to tears on camera recently, but Israel's Arabic military spokesman released his own video after, accusing him of pretending to be pained, and promoting Hamas propaganda. The CPJ, Reporters Without Borders and others report that more journalists in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks in a single year of war than in any conflict on record, anywhere.

Article: toggle caption Aurelien Morissard, left and center, Pavel Bednyakov, right/AP MOSCOW — President Trump said he was quickly moving forward with plans to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday — a snap summit that will see Trump once again pursue his goal of a negotiated end to Putin's war in Ukraine. Trump indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was unlikely to be included in talks he described as a "feel out meeting" to better understand Russia's demands for ending the war. Over the weekend, leaders from the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland and the European Commission issued a statement insisting Kyiv be included in any talks about its own future. "I'm going to meet with President Putin and I'm going to see what he has in mind," said Trump, adding he would then inform NATO and European partners as well as President Zelenskyy. Putin may be talking about peace, said Zelenskyy, but "certainly not getting ready for a ceasefire or an end to the war." "There is no sign that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a postwar situation," Zelenskyy said. Confusion over Russia's position Given the summit was just announced last week, planning has unfolded at breakneck speed — with the exact time, place and length of the meetings still largely unknown. "For both." Publicly, Putin has shown little sign of pulling back from maximalistist demands that include an end to Ukraine's NATO ambitions, Ukraine's disarmament and Kyiv's formal ceding of all land claimed but not totally controlled by Russian forces. From sanctions to summit Russians have largely celebrated news of the Alaskan summit — which appeared to at least postpone a Trump threat to impose massive secondary sanctions and tariffs on most Russian energy exports. Instead, Putin will hold his first summit with an American leader since 2021, when then-President Biden sought to convince him to stand down his forces ahead of what would become the largest land war in Europe in a generation. "In my view, Vladimir Putin showed was nothing short of a masterclass in diplomacy," wrote Yury Podolyak, one of a group of Russian pro-war bloggers that have gained notoriety — and influence — amid the war in Ukraine. "In general, the very fact that a summit being held in Alaska without Zelensky and his European sponsors — is a substantial diplomatic victory," Podolyak chimed in an article in the daily tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets . Trump, too, inadvertently highlighted Alaska's Russian roots when he misspoke at the White House Monday and said "I'm going to Russia on Friday." The irony: Russian nationalists have long argued that Alaska should be returned back to the Russian fold — part of a Russian focus on empire and history that, in many ways, led to the conflict unfolding in Ukraine.

Article: Zelenskyy says Putin 'definitely' not preparing to end war despite Trump summit LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for "new offensive operations" despite Friday's looming peace summit in Alaska. Ukrainian representatives are not expected to attend, though a source in Zelenskyy's office told ABC News on Monday that "everything is very fluid." Zelenskyy and his officials have gone on a diplomatic offensive ahead of the meeting, seeking to shore up foreign support behind Ukraine's key demands in any peace deal. Putin is determined only to present a meeting with America as his personal victory and then continue acting exactly as before, applying the same pressure on Ukraine as before." Ukrainian Presidential Press Service on June 27, 2024, in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky looks on during a signature ceremony of Agreement on Security Cooperation and Long-term Support between Ukraine and Estonia during the European Council Summit at the EU headquarters in Brussels, Donald Trump looking on during a meeting with France's President at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on December 7, 2024, and Russian President Vladimir Putin as he gives a speech during an event to mark the 1160th anniversary of Russia's statehood in Veliky Novgorod on September 21, 2022. "On the contrary, they are redeploying their troops and forces in ways that suggest preparations for new offensive operations." "If someone is preparing for peace, this is not what he does," Zelenskyy said. Among Moscow's demands are that Ukraine cede several regions -- not all of which are controlled by Russian troops -- in the south and east of the country, accept curbs on the size and sophistication of its military and be permanently excluded from NATO. Russia's demands, Zelenskyy has said, constitute an attempt to "partition Ukraine." President Donald Trump on Monday described the coming summit as a "feel out meeting," telling reporters, "I'm going in to speak to Vladimir, and I'm going to be telling him, 'You got to end this war. You got to end it'." "And at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made," Trump said.

Article: Late on Sunday, an Israeli attack hit a media tent outside the main gate of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, killing Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, 28, along with colleagues Mohammed Qreiqeh, 33, Ibrahim Zaher, 25, Mohammed Noufal, 29, and Moamen Aliwa, 23. Hazami Barmada, one of the organisers of the Washington, DC protest, told Al Jazeera the media organisations had helped to create “public consent for the murder of these journalists … by making excuses for the Israeli government to target and kill them”. She added: “After their death, [the media organisations] continue to justify the illegal death, shooting, bombing and murdering journalists, which is a crime against humanity and a war crime.” Press freedom group PEN America said the killing of the five journalists in Gaza “raises grave concerns” and “could amount to a war crime”. “This attack not only wiped out an entire team of journalists – at a time when there are fewer and fewer voices able to report from Gaza – but also took six more Palestinian lives in an onslaught that has already claimed thousands of lives,” said Liesl Gerntholtz, managing director of its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Center. “The fact that [Anas] al-Sharif’s family, friends, and colleagues must now defend him from unsupported accusations rather than being able to mourn him and honour his legacy as a journalist adds to the disgraceful nature of this crime,” Gerntholtz added. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), the largest organisation representing journalists in Australia, said al-Sharif’s “reports brought to the world the reality of the horrors being inflicted by the Israeli Government on the civilians in Gaza”.

Article: A Palestinian activist was killed by the violence he sought to stop toggle caption Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images UMM AL-KHAIR, West Bank — In this village of 500 people in the West Bank, a bulldozer worked steadily at a pile of boulders near cement-block houses. The sounds of shoveling and heavy machinery could be heard under the cries of mourning from where dozens of villagers and visitors gathered on July 31 to grieve for Awdah Al Hathaleen, a beloved 31-year-old Palestinian activist, father of three and documentary filmmaker who was shot here four days earlier. His story is that of many Palestinians living in the West Bank under Israeli occupation, with their lives and livelihoods under increasing threat from a strongly supported settler movement that is urged on by Israel's current right-wing government. toggle caption Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images In a widely circulated video, a settler who brought his bulldozer to the village in late July is seen waving and shooting his handgun toward villagers at the time Hathaleen was struck by a bullet. According to Muslim tradition, burial of the dead should take place within 24 hours, but Israeli authorities held Hathaleen's body for 10 days, keeping his loved ones in agony while authorities insisted on restrictions around his funeral. Hathaleen was widely known and respected around the world Nadav Weiman is a former Israeli soldier who heads an organization of former soldiers called Breaking the Silence, which is working to end Israel's occupation of the West Bank. "He could really speak to crowds and that's why we brought so many people to meet him — because he gave a very interesting angle of what it is to be a Palestinian under Israeli occupation." Because of his work on No Other Land and his years of activism, Hathaleen, who was also an English teacher, had friends from all over the world. But the moment you leave, they're going to come here." Attacks by settlers have increased since 2023 Israeli activist Guy Butavia has worked in the South Hebron Hills for 15 years to help communities keep their land as settlers try to take it away. Sponsor Message Between January and June of this year, there have been more than 2,000 settler attacks resulting in casualties or damage to property, according to OCHA, the United Nations humanitarian coordination body. Now they can't reach their lands and can barely get out of the doors of their homes without coming under threat." toggle caption Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images He says activists have changed strategies — they are now staying overnight inside Palestinian homes to try to protect them and bear witness to settler violence. Because, he says, "If it's not on camera, it didn't happen." Since the war, he says, some settlers are now serving in the Israeli military and come back to patrol West Bank communities near their own settlements, where they behave with impunity. They decide where you can go and where you cannot." Sponsor Message In Hathaleen's last message to his large WhatsApp group when the settler bulldozer rolled into his village on Sunday, July 27 — read aloud at the gathering with foreign diplomats and dignitaries before his funeral — he warned that settlers were trying to cut water to his community. "If they cut the pipe, the community here will literally be without any drop of water." A mother's grief In the women's mourning tent, Hathaleen's mother Khadra Al Hathaleen said her son was getting ready for a trip to the U.S. Villagers hoped No Other Land's success would help protect them "Awdah was our friend and he was a partner," says Rabbi Avi Dabush, CEO of Rabbis for Human Rights, who was among many Jewish activists present in the mourning tent ahead of the funeral. We believe in the core values for us of Judaism and even Zionism, of living together, or reaching out in peace." toggle caption Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images People in this village say they believed the Oscar-winning documentary that helped highlight their struggle with settler violence might bring them a measure of protection — perhaps even lay the groundwork for peace. "He was the person that always gathered us — and he was shot in front of the community center that he built for the kids to play and to have summer camp and to learn." Sponsor Message It's been more than two weeks now since Hathaleen lost his life.

Article: — A customer is waiting as Patrick Gormandy steers his deep-water trawler — the Captain Sam B — back to the dock after a day of shrimping on Mobile Bay. Gormandy blames the decline in part on a federal project to expand and maintain the Mobile ship channel, the route through the bay that allows big ships to get from the Gulf of Mexico into the Port of Mobile. Army Corps of Engineers has a permit to put the material they dig out of the channel into other parts of the expansive Mobile Bay, which critics say is choking the estuary with dredging mud. "We want to leave this bay better than we found it, and it's going to be hard to do that." toggle caption Debbie Elliott/NPR Gormandy is a part of a wide-ranging and unlikely coalition that includes both commercial and recreational fishing interests, property owners, environmental groups, and Republican elected officials. "But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it, and the way they are doing it is wrong." Sponsor Message Barnes builds and repairs shrimp nets for a living. "The federal government probably looks at us like the back end of a northbound horse is about as delicate as I can put it." toggle caption Debbie Elliott/NPR "We're fighting foreign imports. toggle caption Blake Jones for NPR Baykeeper has been trying to get the Corps to stop the practice for years, and is now asking Congress to intervene by banning it in the upcoming appropriations bill, or through the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) next year. Sponsor Message Strickland wants to see the Corps use more of the dredge material for coastal restoration projects, or take it offshore to the open Gulf, as was the practice between 1986 and 2014. "That's where the real disconnect in the public perception right now is." McDonald says they dredge four million cubic yards of material a year on average, the equivalent of about 200,000 large dump truck loads. And turbidity, if you get a good south wind blowing, or you get a big rain event, the bay turns to chocolate milk." Sponsor Message The Alabama Port Authority supports the project because it will allow the Port of Mobile to accommodate the much larger cargo ships now coming through the Panama Canal. "There is no port on the Gulf of Mexico presently that can take any of those ships." He says the chamber supports the Corps permit in part based on assessments from the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program, and the U.S. "There's no more silt around my house on Mobile Bay today than it was when I moved in 24 years ago." Still, the coalition's fight against what it calls "mud dumping" is gaining traction. I'd like to get five pounds of big daddies," says Alabama state Senator Chris Elliott, looking over the iced-down tubs of locally-caught shrimp at a rustic waterfront seafood market in Bon Secour, on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. "I just want to make sure that what we're doing for the big guys, for the port to keep that up and operating so that big container ships are coming in, which I'm fully in favor of and supportive of, that it doesn't squeeze out these locals, these guys that have been here forever that are trying to make their living catching seafood." A local heritage, he says, that's worth protecting.

Article: The president warned that the "homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY." A general view of a homeless encampment outside the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., U.S., Aug. President Donald Trump vowed this week to rid Washington, D.C., of homeless encampments, issuing a warning that the "homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY." Though what those plans will look like, including where people will go, is unclear, sparking concerns among advocacy groups. While previewing an announcement regarding D.C., Trump told those experiencing homelessness in a social media post on Sunday, "We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital." In his remarks the following day, Trump said that the federal government will be "removing homeless encampments from all over our parks" in D.C. But they'll not be allowed to turn our capital into a wasteland for the world to see," Trump said during a press briefing on Monday while announcing plans for the federal government to take over the D.C. "What is particularly startling is the vague language about removing them from the district altogether, without any details about where they would go, who would transport them, how that's funded, what that means for their human and civil rights," White said of Trump's recent remarks. Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the D.C.-based National Coalition for the Homeless, said that though Trump mentioned homelessness during Monday's press conference several times, there was "no concrete information about how to address the issue," such as resources that would be developed to address the issue in a non-punitive matter, or where people will be moved. "It points to it being more of a stunt than an actual conference about solutions to homelessness." President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Aug. "We really haven't gotten any more detail about the plan, about the words that he said," she said during a press briefing Monday afternoon when asked about Trump's remarks on homelessness. "It wasn't referenced in the executive order that came down." "I believe he had a previous executive order that also identified Attorney General Bondi as a point of contact as it relates to homelessness and such, so we'll follow up with her," Bowser continued. Last month, Trump also signed an executive order seeking to make it easier for cities and states to remove homeless people from the streets and into treatment centers by reversing judicial precedents and ending consent decrees. "When we clear encampments, we disconnect people from the services they need to survive and to start the process of being housed, and often disconnects them from their belongings and from the communities that they formed in encampments," White said. There certainly isn't enough housing." According to D.C.'s most recent census of people experiencing homelessness, released in May, there was an overall 9% decrease in homelessness in 2025 from the previous year, including an 18.1% decrease among families and a 4.5% decrease among single individuals.

Article: On sales rose 32% in the Swiss sportswear company's second quarter, leading it to raise its full-year revenue guidance even as it contends with new tariffs on imports from Vietnam. The buzzy sneaker brand, which has been credited with taking market share from Nike , now expects full year-sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs ($3.58 billion), up from its previous outlook of 2.86 billion francs ($3.52 billion). "We have a lot of confidence in our lifestyle business, so we skewed the price increases more towards the lifestyle business, while trying to stay a bit more where we were on our running products," Hoffmann explained. "So far, we don't see negative impact from the price increases." The company, which has grown more than 30% in nearly every quarter since 2023, beat Wall Street's sales expectations for the second quarter. Here's how On did in its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Loss per share: 9 cents in francs ($0.11) adjusted. 705 million francs ($868 million) expected On's net loss in the three months ended June 30 was 40.9 million francs ($50.4 million) or 12 cents ($0.15) per share, compared to a net income of $30.8 million ($37.9 million), or 10 cents ($0.12) per share, in the year-ago period. In a sneaker category that's been relatively soft in recent years, On has consistently grown sales in the mid-double digits and still has more room to grow given how low its brand awareness is in some parts of the world. While On doesn't break out its performance in China, Hoffmann said it's been a bright spot for the company, as sales grew about 50% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. "We have seen basically 50% same-store growth in our retail stores, even bigger growth in our [e-commerce] channel, and then the new stores come on top so … China is a very strong market for us."

The rescue group said civilians were “killed either by stray bullets or direct executions” at the camp, located on the northern outskirts of el-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur still held by the Sudanese army. War and famine The war between Sudan’s army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and created what the United Nations describes as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis.

Article: When Camp Mystic wanted to build in Central Texas areas considered high risk on Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance maps, it did what many property owners do: It hired engineers to take a closer look. From 2013 to 2020, the overnight girls camp asked FEMA to redesignate the flood risk for 65 of its buildings at its sprawling facilities in Texas’ Guadalupe Valley — more buildings than previously known. The government agency told NBC News that in that period of time it altered the status of 60 buildings, changing the risk designations of both decades-old buildings and its new construction from “high” to “moderate” or “low,” on paper. This summer, late on July 4 into the early hours of July 5, a flood beyond anyone’s expectations killed 28 campers and staffers, inundating many of the Camp Mystic buildings. A review of documents related to Camp Mystic — from county floodplain development records, an engineering study, FEMA flood map determinations and federal flood insurance studies — offers a window into a process that experts say plays out for thousands of properties each year, quietly shrinking the footprint of the nation’s flood risk on paper, even as climate change makes flooding a more severe threat on the ground. “One of the problems with FEMA is it appears to be negotiable as opposed to an empirical or science-based understanding of risk,” said Jeremy Porter, the chief economist at First Street, a research firm that studies housing and climate risks. “It’s based on the ability to create an engineering study and negotiate with FEMA.” Properties in flood zones are often required to get costly flood insurance, and being in this area, on paper, can drive down property values. In Kerr County, site of the most devastating Texas floods last month, property owners have to elevate structures at least 12 inches above the base flood level and take other flood precautions if they’re found to be in the floodplain. “The unknown is whether being drawn out of those flood lines affected the choices the camp made of where to develop further cabins and structures,” said Sarah Pralle, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School who has studied federal flood policy.

Article: The demonstrations scheduled for Saturday — branded as "Fight the Trump Takeover" — are being organized by more than three dozen groups, including the Democratic National Committee, according to plans shared first with NBC News. "Trump knows the only way he can hold the majority after his budget betrayal is by changing the rules in the middle of the game to avoid accountability for ripping health care and food away from millions of Americans," said DNC Chair Ken Martin in a statement, referring to Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill that he signed into law last month. Drucilla Tigner, executive director of the group, said the protests will focus on "the future of our democracy." "Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here," Tigner said in a statement. The announcement comes as Democratic state legislators from Texas remain outside of the state in an effort to deny Republicans a necessary quorum to move forward with redistricting plans that could ultimately help Republicans pick up five seats in the U.S. "It lasts 30 days, and as soon as this one is over, I’m going to call another one, then another one, then another one, then another one." Abbott also said that if the Democratic legislators return to Texas, "they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol." Several Democratic governors, meanwhile, have vowed to pursue redistricting efforts their states to offset potential GOP congressional gains if Texas moves forward. Gavin Newsom sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Monday, urging him to ask Abbott to abandon redistricting efforts, or he would be "forced" to work to redraw California's map.

Article: As war rages, she is living among the ruins of the Islamic University, a once-bustling educational institution that, like most others in Gaza, has become a shelter for displaced people. Ali is part of a generation of Palestinians in Gaza – from primary school through university students – who say they have been robbed of an education by nearly two years of Israeli air strikes that have destroyed the enclave’s institutions. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, according to the latest satellite-based damage assessment in July, 97 percent of educational facilities in Gaza have sustained some level of damage with 91 percent requiring major rehabilitation or complete reconstruction to become functional again. Israel plans a new Gaza offensive, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he expected to complete “fairly quickly”, as the UN Security Council heard new demands for an end to the suffering in the Palestinian enclave.

Article: In that scenario, a separate inflation measure preferred by the Federal Reserve would rise to 3.2% in December, well ahead of the central bank’s official 2% target, the analysts said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that if it weren’t for Trump’s tariffs, the Fed would have lowered interest rates by now in order to make borrowing in the economy cheaper and thus help boost employment. In remarks delivered Saturday, Michele Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said any inflationary impact from tariffs should be considered a “one-off,” and that excluding those effects reveals a pace of price growth that is much more subdued. “Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.” Some economists estimate it could take as long as 18 months for the tariffs’ impact to fully make their way through the economy. While inflation-adjusted weekly earnings ticked up last quarter, approximately 43% of workers saw their paychecks grow less than the cost of living as of June according to Indeed, with most concentrated at the low-to-middle end of the pay spectrum, according to Indeed. A separate measure of current and future family financial situations tracked by the Conference Board research and consulting group deteriorated in July, with the share of consumers expecting a recession over the next 12 months still above the levels seen in 2024.

Article: In a statement, European leaders said "the people of Ukraine must have the freedom to decide their future." European leaders have warned against Ukrainian borders being redrawn by force – two days before a US-Russia summit on Ukraine is due to take place in Alaska. The statement underscored the nervousness felt by Europeans about Moscow's actions in Ukraine, which many countries – particularly those bordering Russia or those in which the memory of Soviet occupation still lingers – believe could pose a direct threat in the near future. US President Donald Trump has insisted that any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" and could see Russia taking the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and keeping Crimea. In their statement, European leaders said "Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has wider implications for European and international security", and stressed the need for a "just and lasting peace". In a post on social media its leader Victor Orban said he had opted out of supporting the statement as it attempted to set conditions for a meeting to which the EU was not invited and warned leaders not to start "providing instructions from the bench". He also urged the EU to set up its own summit with Russia – though EU leaders have been shunning direct talks with Moscow since it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They will be hoping to put the security of the European continent and Ukrainian interests at the forefront of his mind – at a time when nervousness is growing that the peace imposed on Ukraine may end up being neither "just" nor "lasting".

Government minister Baroness Jacqui Smith told the BBC this was an "unacceptable number of people" but pointed to the "one in, one out" returns deal with France as a deterrent.

Article: With hours left on the clock before the looming midnight Tuesday deadline, Trump's executive order acknowledged that China was taking "significant steps" toward addressing American concerns on "economic and national security matters." Beijing announced the truce extension at the same time. Sponsor Message The extension gives the two sides a further 90 days to iron out their differences on a range of issues as Trump seeks to reshape the global economy in favor of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. announces several trade agreements with countries including South Korea and Japan on the one hand, while it levies steep tariffs on several nations on the other — for example, Trump has threatened to raise U.S. "Today's news all-round stabilizes the situation, increases confidence for American consumers, for importers of goods who sell those goods in the U.S., and for manufacturers in China," said David Meale, the head of Eurasia Group's China Division and a former diplomat and deputy chief of mission for the U.S. and China will come to some kind of trade arrangement, and the next steps are likely to be driven by the prospect of a leaders' meeting between President Trump and President Xi later this fall." Meale says he thinks the next steps for both sides will involve more meetings between trade and economic officials like the ones held in Stockholm last month, to lay the groundwork for an eventual face-to-face meeting and a more concrete trade agreement which could be signed before the latest truce expires on Nov. At a meeting in Geneva in May, however, tensions cooled when the two sides announced a 90-day truce , with both countries lowering tariff rates and easing other trade barriers including deliveries of Chinese rare earth minerals. and China have been complex and included several issues, ranging from American concerns about Chinese overproduction and purchases of Russian oil to Chinese complaints about Washington's decision to limit exports of semiconductors that China needs to power AI systems. Meale says the American priority for these negotiations will be to lower its trade deficit with China, to secure and diversify its supply chains away from reliance on China and to make sure the flow of rare earth minerals from China will be stable. Sponsor Message China, Meale says, is "looking for stability" in its relationship with the U.S., as it faces a slower-growing economy and seeks a more predictable environment for its businesses. Nicholas Lardy, a nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, also says a final U.S.-China trade deal may include easing of technology restrictions, and a less likely possibility might be Chinese promises to invest in U.S.

Some Russians, including Kremlin envoy Kirill Dimitriev, are pointing to that period on social media, posting photos of Russian Orthodox Churches, with their onion domes, that were built in Alaska in the 19th-century and still stand. Sponsor Message "Some Americans might know that we bought Alaska from Russia, but they don't know necessarily that it was a real colony there," said Lee Farrow, a history professor at Auburn University at Montgomery and author of Seward's Folly: A New Look at the Alaska Purchase. They had a strong presence in California as well." Farrow was referring to Fort Ross, an outpost the Russians established in what's now part of Sonoma County in northern California. Sold for a pittance Russia's decision to sell Alaska was motivated by its need to pay off war debts accumulated during the 1853-56 Crimean War, which Russia lost to the combined forces of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. By this time, Russian hunters in Alaska had killed off most of the accessible bears, wolves, otters and other animals with valuable furs and pelts, and therefore the Russians saw little economic reason to stay. "There has been a very strong narrative in Russia that we either did not pay for it or it was a lease, and we should have returned it already."

They would be split into two groups of 300 and stationed at military bases in Alabama and Arizona, with purview of regions east and west of the Mississippi River, respectively.

The Trump administration is relying on a shaky legal theory that the president can act broadly to protect federal property and functions said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice who specializes in legal issues germane to the U.S. “You don’t want to normalize routine domestic deployment.” Advertisement The strategy is further complicated by the fact that National Guard members from one state cannot operate in another state without permission, Nunn said. “It actually makes it more likely that you’re going to see domestic deployments — because why else have a task force?” The proposal represents a major departure in how the National Guard traditionally has been used, said Lindsay P. While it is not unusual for National Guard units to be deployed for domestic emergencies within their states, including for civil disturbances, this “is really strange because essentially nothing is happening,” she said. “There is a well-established procedure that exists to request additional assistance during times of need,” Carter said, “and the Trump administration is blatantly and dangerously ignoring that precedent.” Advertisement Advertisement One action memo contained in the documents, dated July 22, recommends that Army military police and Air Force security forces receive additional training for the mission.

Article: Flush with cash from a period of resilient earnings, a growing number of European companies are shunning high-stakes deals in favor of smaller and targeted "bolt-on" acquisitions to pursue growth. "This is a time again as part of playing offense, where we're definitely considering what M & A might be on the table," Hanneke Faber, CEO of Swiss-American hardware maker Logitech , told CNBC's " Squawk Box Europe " after announcing its first-quarter results. Sawan said those are the type of deals that can help Shell "grow without having to do a big splash." Sawan is not alone in rethinking large-scale M & As. "Given the situation on golden power, there was no other place to go, and at some point, you need to catch your losses, eliminate your drag, and focus on what you control," Orcel told CNBC, referring to the Italian government's power to block deals in strategic sectors. "We are much more into being very selective, very value accretive in terms of how this complements country by country, our portfolio of customers and technologies." The company announced that three such deals made in Canada, Peru and Italy were closed in a single week in July, on top of larger acquisitions in Australia and Latin America. "This is really part of the strategy of Givaudan, which is around the bolt-on acquisitions, to buy small competitors, which give us a very nice and interesting portfolio of clients that we don't necessarily have, and the two, combined with Givaudan, is a great way to grow," said CEO Gilles Andrier. Dutch grocer Ahold Delhaize , which has been the subject of rumors about a potential mega-merger with France's Carrefour in late 2024, pointed instead to its recent 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) acquisition of Romanian supermarket chain Profi as proof of its active M & A strategy. "We also look at other opportunities to grow the company inorganically through M & A, and that's why we are always looking at what we can do in Europe and the US," said chief executive Frans Muller. We have a strong balance sheet where we have the strength to do these kinds of things." "We're actively looking and where things fit our strategy agenda and fit also, let's say, the right economic values, we are open to these kinds of things," Muller added. Executives are also keenly aware of the operational burdens that M & As can create in integrating the acquired business into their own firms, highlighting the attractiveness of smaller deals. So we are, at the moment, very cautious in looking at future acquisitions." — CNBC's Juliana Tatelbaum, Karen Tso, Steve Sedgwick, Silvia Amaro, Annette Weisbach, and Carolin Roth contributed reporting.

If Trump’s gambit succeeds — and right now it looks as if it will — then California and other states that could counter the premature Texas redistricting have only one choice — to respond in kind. California Newsom warns Trump in heated letter he’s ‘playing with fire’ on redistricting ‘If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states,’ Newsom wrote to Trump. Advertisement Voices Contributor: Newsom’s cynical redistricting ploy should be rejected by voters Newsom, California Democrats and their attempt to wrest power from the state’s independent redistricting system are no better — and maybe worse — than Abbott and the Texas Republicans. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who represented New York for nearly a quarter century, warned decades ago about the tendency to “ define deviancy down ” and normalize actions that are anything but normal. Gavin Newsom succinctly put it: “California’s moral high ground means nothing if we’re powerless because of it.” Politics Newsom welcomes Texas Democrats who fled to foil Trump’s redistricting plan Gov. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump’s plan to redraw voting maps to hold on to power in the midterm election. The solution Newsom has proposed is a prudent one — redrawing just the congressional lines, not those for the state Legislature as well, and only doing so until the next census, when Trump will have passed from the scene. Cost was a reason to oppose the wishful-thinking 2021 recall election launched against Newsom (which he defeated with more than 60% of the vote), but the argument applies less so today given that Trump’s extreme unilateral actions — budget cuts and slashed programs, ICE raids, the attack on higher education, including the University of California — are putting California’s fiscal future at risk. Czech dissident-turned-statesman Vaclav Havel, in his famous essay “ The Power of the Powerless ,” described the Prague Spring not only as a “clash between two groups on the level of real power” but as the “final act … of a long drama originally played out chiefly in the theatre of the spirit and the conscience of society.” We do not know how the current drama will play out. If Trump continues to goad Texas into abandoning its commitment to the norms of our election rules, Americans who hold onto hope that their voices still matter will be counting on California to show the way.

The film and TV actor is best known for his work in the 1990s series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.” He was no Christopher Reeve or Henry Cavill. “If you want to save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America’s streets.” Later that day, Cain appeared on Fox News to claim he was going to “be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.” a role Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin later on clarified to the New York Times would be only honorary.

(Chris Pizzello / Invision / Associated Press) Its appeal to Superman is part of their campaign to cast la migra as good guys while casting all undocumented people as shadowy villains who deserve deportation — the faster and nastier the better. In early June, they put Trump, who couldn’t leap over a bingo card in a single bound let alone a tall building, on the White House’s social media accounts in a Superman costume. In a 1950 poster, as McCarthyism was ramping up, DC Comics issued a poster in which Superman tells a group of kids that anyone who makes fun of people for their “religion, race or national origin ... is un-American.” Advertisement A decade later, Superman starred in a comic book public service announcement in which he chided a teen who said “Those refugee kids can’t talk English or play ball or anything” by taking him to a shabby camp to show the boy the hardships refugees had to endure. It might surprise you to know that in even more recent times, in a 2017 comic book, Superman saves a group of undocumented immigrants from a man in an American flag do-rag who opened fire on them. That’s who Superman né Cain says ICE is pursuing — the oft repeated “worst of the worst” — but Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse found that 71% of people currently held in ICE detention have no criminal records as of July 27 . I don’t think the real Superman — by whom I mean the fictional one whom Cain seems to think he’s the official spokesperson for just because he played him in a middling dramedy 30-some years ago — would waste his strength and X-ray vision to nab people like that.

Article: The scene at the dais in Riverside’s City Council chambers looked a bit different on a recent Monday morning: Instead of men and women in business attire, children wearing navy blue T-shirts emblazoned with vibrant orange and yellow butterfly wings occupied the swivel chairs. The children were participating in a mock council meeting as part of a summer leadership program run by TODEC, a legal center serving immigrants and farmworkers in the Inland Empire and Coachella Valley. Advertisement “When people are going through stuff like that they get emotional and they get sad,” explained incoming fifth-grader Montserrat Garcia, leaning into the microphone as she assumed the role of mayor. After a bit of discussion and guidance from Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson and TODEC executive director Luz Gallegos, the mock city council unanimously voted to fund mental health workshops for their community. “If you read about it, you hear about it in books, it’s nothing like being here and having the privilege of coming in and actually seeing how the process works.” Using civic knowledge to push for change That’s been the intention of Monarcas Luchadoras, which translates to monarchs in the struggle. “We are seeing kids as young as 4 years old knowing what ICE is, knowing that they may be undocumented, knowing that their parents and family and friends are undocumented,” she said. The students took advantage of a rare field trip and explored art installations at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture and learned about the historical figures whose statues make up the city’s Civil Rights Walk. At the museum, a few kids lingered in front of a painting of a low rider, while others ran toward an installation with glass seashells typically used to call out to gods such as the Aztec goddess Cihuateotl, who was depicted at the installation. Advertisement “They’re teaching me how to keep up our culture, how to help other people, not just ourselves, how to be nice and kind, how to be respectful,” fifth-grader Garcia said. Stepping up for Riverside’s immigrant community The children have learned a lot just by being in the environment, said Linda Cruz, whose three children soaked in the new experiences, including her 3-year-old daughter Mia, who joins the group at events like Monday’s field trip. “It’s giving them confidence that I think a lot of people in our community lack.” Gallegos and other TODEC leaders have pushed kids to think about solutions even if they’re not old enough to vote.

Article: At the start of the spring semester in January at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, a dozen military veterans waited for their GI Bill student benefit checks to show up. “They’ll only answer questions about one student at a time, so I have to hang up and start over again.” Nearly 600,000 veterans received a total of about $10 billion worth of GI Bill benefits last year for education, according to the VA. But Trump administration efforts to scale down the size of the VA by about 30,000 positions and to dismantle the Department of Education, which manages some student aid for veterans, have caused funding delays and are hampering students’ ability to understand and get answers about their education benefits, advocacy groups say. Advertisement “Part of the challenge of wrapping our arms around this is the opaqueness of the whole thing,” said Barmak Nassirian, vice president for higher education policy at Veterans Education Success. “We’re sort of feeling our way around the impact.” Frustration mounting “The whole process” has become a mess, said one 33-year-old Navy vet in Colorado, who asked that his name not be disclosed for fear of reprisal from federal authorities.

Vets struggle to get benefits The VA disruptions threaten “access to veterans’ education benefits , just as even more veterans and service members may be turning to higher education and career training,” the American Council on Education, or ACE — the nation’s largest association of colleges and universities — wrote in June. “Eligibility rules can be confusing,” ACE wrote, and are rife with “time-consuming red tape.” As a result, “many students and the institutions that serve them rely on VA staff to interpret the rules, resolve disputes, and ensure benefits are processed on time. Ten colleges and universities with the largest veteran enrollments in the nation — including San Diego State, Georgia State, Angelo State, Arizona State and Syracuse — also did not respond to, or declined to answer, questions. Advertisement In the military city of San Diego, where thousands of former and current service members go to college, student veterans at Miramar College this year waited months to hear about VA work-study contracts, which previously had been approved within days.

Article: At the LAPD, the number of Black recruits — especially women — has been dropping for years, leaving the department far short of diversity goals put in place decades ago to counter discriminatory hiring practices. Advertisement California How ICE is using the LAPD to track down immigrants for deportation LAPD leaders say the department has strict limits on cooperating with immigration officials, but court records show federal authorities are nevertheless using local police information sent to national databases to find new targets. The Oscar Joel Bryant Assn., which represents the LAPD’s 700 or so Black officers, said conversations about responding to attacks on pro-diversity programs “do not need to wait for the future.” Advertisement “[T]hose concerns are here today for all groups,” Capt. “When we swore an oath to protect the Constitution and the organization’s very mission statement elevates DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) principles, I do not see how we can step away from them now or ever.” Privately, some Black department officials expressed frustration with recent promotions announced by McDonnell. California LAPD undergoes first major leadership shake-up with McDonnell as chief LAPD Jim McDonnell has given new assignments to more than a dozen officials from the Police Department’s upper ranks, elevating three deputy chiefs to top positions and resurrecting a long-dormant bureau. Several high-ranking Black LAPD officials, including Tingirides and Deputy Chiefs Gerald Woodyard and Alan Hamilton, have already enrolled in the deferred retirement program, meaning they probably will exit before the 2028 Olympic Games in L.A. This year, an officer from the department’s recruitment unit filed a complaint alleging he had recorded racist, sexist and homophobic comments by colleagues, which McDonnell and other officials condemned and pledged to investigate. Over the last decade, the department has paid out more than $10 million in settlements or jury awards for officers alleging that they were discriminated against based on their race. But a succession of LAPD leaders have said that diversifying the agency’s ranks is a priority, arguing that doing so can counter generations of distrust of police by Black Angelenos. Since the start of his second term in office, Trump has called diversity hiring efforts “illegal,” encouraging federal agencies to investigate and withhold funds from institutions that promote DEI practices. Ivonne Roman of the Center for Policing Equity, a nonprofit think tank based at Yale University, said the president’s anti-affirmative orders will undoubtedly undercut efforts to turn the tide on declining Black officer numbers nationwide.

Sherman, who represents parts of the San Fernando Valley and Pacific Palisades, said that one of the two detainees at B-18 on Monday rested with his head on a table. A federal judge last month temporarily barred the government from mass sweeps in Los Angeles and seven nearby counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that the targets are in the U.S. The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which sued the federal government over the sweeps, described B-18 as “dungeon-like” and accused the administration of failing to “provide basic necessities like food, water, adequate hygiene facilities, and medical care.” Detainees were allegedly subjected to overcrowding and did not have adequate sleeping accommodations. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has said that claims of poor conditions at ICE detention centers are “false” and that the agency “has higher detention standards than most U.S. She said the representatives replied, “That’s not us, and we go in if there’s probable cause, if there’s a warrant out there.” Gomez, who has been repeatedly turned away from entering the B-18 facility since the crackdown started earlier this year, is part of a group of Democratic House members suing the federal government over the lack of access. The lawsuit, filed last month in federal district court in Washington, said the individuals attempted to visit a detention facility, either by showing up in person or by giving Homeland Security Department officials advance notice, and were unlawfully blocked from entering.

July 27 Update No ongoing storms are currently in the Atlantic Basin, and the National Hurricane Center doesn't have any areas highlighted for potential development over the next 7 days either. July 26 Update While the Pacific Basin remains active with numerous potential storms, the Atlantic Basin is staying nice and quiet with no active storms and no potential storms over the next 7 days. NHC continues to monitor the system for possible development, giving it a 10% chance of becoming a depression over the next day or two as it approaches the Texas Coast. The system is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northern Gulf coast and still has only a 10% chance of developing into a tropical depression. While it's unlikely to develop, it is likely to bring a surge of tropical moisture to Southeast Texas Friday and Saturday, boosting the chances for heavy downpours to 60% and 70%, respectively. We also will have to keep an eye on the Gulf in the second half of this week as moisture rounds an area of high pressure and moves into the northern Gulf. It's actually remnants from the unnamed system that brought flooding to Louisiana last week, but regardless of it's origins or any future development, it could spread some rain into Southeast Texas by the end of the work week. The NHC does have a 10% chance of development on a separate system in the Central Atlantic, but it seems unlikely to develop and/or to pose a threat to Texas. The National Hurricane Center is highlighting a disturbance in the central Atlantic with a 20% chance of development, but as of now models are not particularly aggressive with development in the area. Of slightly greater interest is the potential for the remnants of the disorganized system that brought flooding rains to Louisiana to cycle around high pressure in the southern US and end up back in the northern Gulf by the end of this upcoming week. Looking ahead beyond the 7-day span, we'll be keeping a watch on the northern Gulf as a spot that could potentially spin something up, but it is not a pressing concern, just something we'll be keeping an eye on. July 4 An area of low pressure has developed off the east coast of Florida over the Atlantic Friday, and only time will tell if this could then organize enough to become the next named storm of the season. Regardless, this system will at the very least keep showers and storms in the forecast throughout the weekend and into early next week across parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. This wouldn't pose a threat to Houston or Southeast Texas but will likely give a rainy holiday weekend to Florida and portions of the East Caost even is a storm doesn't develop. Regardless of whether or not this storm becomes Tropical Storm Barry, our local impacts are the same, just an increase in moisture leading to about a 60% chance of showers and storms. This will be a short-lived system though as Potential Storm Two will move ashore over Mexico late Sunday night or early Monday morning, potentially making landfall as a weak tropical storm with 40 mph winds. A small area of thunderstorms east of Bermuda has become better organized and is likely to become a short-lived tropical storm later today before the system encounters an unfavorable environment. In the eastern Pacific, Erick has weakened to a low pressure system and will continue to produce additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches to parts of southwest Mexico. Based on the forecast Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland over the mountains of southern Mexico, with the system likely to dissipate by Thursday night or early Friday. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Bay of Campeche over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. There are signs that something may try to spin up over the Gulf over the next couple of weeks, but it's too far out to get more specific than that. Over the span of the next two to three weeks the National Hurricane Center is highlighting an area of potential development in the southern gulf and western Caribbean which could eventually produce a tropical cyclone, but it is not an immediate threat and for now it remains just an area we will watch closely. After a record season for the Gulf Coast in 2024, which included Hurricane Beryl making landfall in southeast Texas, ABC13 Meteorologist Elyse Smith has a preview of what to look out for this year. This hurricane season is more than likely going to be an ENSO neutral year, or a "La Nada." This means the Trade Winds over the Atlantic are in their usual position at normal strength. Of those, 6-10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

Article: “I laugh at the Democrats who are now all of a sudden so interested in the Epstein files,” Vance said in an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. And now President Trump has demanded full transparency from this, and yet somehow the Democrats are attacking him, and not the Biden administration, which did nothing for four years.” Vance is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger. And it was Trump’s Department of Justice that gave Epstein a so-called “sweetheart deal.” But on top of that, Vance is only making the case for releasing the Epstein files stronger. The allure of the Epstein files, for those most interested in them, is the conviction that Epstein’s social scene reveals a secret world of elite exploitation and impunity that spans the political spectrum. And insofar as the rumors about Epstein track with the (preposterous) QAnon conspiracy theory, its proponents believe that politicians and plutocrats on the left side of the spectrum stand to lose the most. A Reuters-Ipsos poll from mid-July found that about a third of Republicans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the issue and that 62% believed that the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list. That poll also found that 82% of Democrats disapproved of Trump’s handling of the issue, and that the same percentage believed the government was hiding information on Epstein’s client list. They’re calling out Trump his allies out for promising to release the Epstein files and boasting that the Epstein client list was allegedly sitting on the attorney general’s desk, and then saying there was no list.

Article: He specifically called out New York Attorney General Letitia James, the trailblazing prosecutor who beat Trump and the Trump organization in court; a judge found that Trump and the organization improperly inflated assets in financial documents to get favorable loan terms. In November 2023, as the trial was ongoing, Trump made a social media post characterizing James’s prosecution against him as a “ridiculous Political Witch Hunt against me” and wrote, “She should be prosecuted!” At a campaign rally in January 2024, he said the judge and James “should be arrested and punished accordingly.” He appears to be actively making good on those vows to pay back the people he says wrong him even though the facts and evidence don’t appear to justify it. NBC News reported Friday that Attorney General Pam Bondi has made MAGA activist Ed Martin a “special attorney” to probe mortgage fraud allegations against James made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William J. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, sent James’s office two subpoenas last week that seek to discover if she violated the rights of Trump and his businesses, as well as the rights of the National Rifle Association. In fact, that panel refused to extend his appointment, and the DOJ got around that rejection with a maneuver that appears to have never been used for the appointment of a U.S. According to a letter The New York Times obtained from the Justice Department’s human resources division, Sarcone has been named “special attorney to the attorney general” indefinitely and is, bizarrely, serving as the acting U.S. His consolation prize was being made DOJ’s pardon attorney and director of DOJ’s “weaponization” working group, which Bondi established with the apparent mission to investigate public officials who — following the facts, law and court rules — secured indictments against Trump. Of the two, Martin is the bigger threat to the rule of law — that is, treating like cases alike — and the bigger threat to the DOJ’s post-Watergate norm of keeping partisan politics out of DOJ decision making. James’s lawyer told ABC News that the accusation was a “lie based on a purposeful misreading of documents in a lawful real estate transaction.” In a letter to Attorney General Bondi in April, that attorney, Abbe D. James’ principal residence and at the same time absolutely ignored her very clear and all caps statement two weeks earlier to the mortgage loan broker that “[t]his property WILL NOT be my primary residence.” Lowell attached email messages that he said show that James was clear that the property would be her niece’s primary residence and that the “broker understood this” because he responded that James would be considered “a non-occupying co-borrower.” Another allegation from Trump’s FHFA says James wrongly claimed that a five-unit dwelling she bought in Brooklyn in 2001 only had four units — as the Times explains “possibly in order to receive better interest rates.” But in the letter Lowell sent Bondi in April, the attorney writes, “The co-occupancy dwelling has four floors and, for as long as Ms. James has lived there, the property has always functioned as a four-person residence.” Lowell said that a 24-year-old certificate of occupancy mistakenly says it’s a 5-unit property, but he attached copies of multiple public documents that he say prove it’s a 4-unit property. What Trump’s DOJ is doing now appears to have been pulled from the same playbook his DOJ used against Democratic governors in New York and New Jersey during his first term. According to that report, in 2020, most of the nursing homes with the lowest quality of care during the Covid pandemic were in the Republican-governed states of Texas and Indiana. However, the report mentions an alarming text message a senior official with DOJ’s Office of Public Affairs sent to at least one colleague on October 17, 2020, weeks before the presidential election. Using DOJ shorthand for the civil rights division and the civil division respectively the text, according to the IG report, said, “I’m trying to get [CRT] and CIV to do letters to [New York/New Jersey] respectively on nursing homes. Will be our last play on them before election but it’s a big one.” “Our last play on them before the election.” Put plainly, DOJ officials were weaponizing the department’s vast powers to attack the president’s political opponents for partisan purposes.

Article: Since President Trump’s return to office, the Department of Justice has increasingly targeted the president’s critics and opponents, including an investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted the Trump Organization for fraud. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell, who is representing James, says that Trump’s “retribution” agenda “makes George Orwell’s ‘1984’ look like a Mother Goose nursery rhyme.” “The manipulation of language” from the administration, Lowell says, “makes your head spin." This politicization of the DOJ, Lowell argues, makes “Department of Weaponization” a more fitting name. He says that Trump’s end goal in this, it seems, is a regime where “only Democrats get scrutinized” while Republicans and Trump allies “get a free pass.” Lowell notes that he does not view his work as partisan, and he has represented figures across the political spectrum, including both Ivanka Trump and Hunter Biden.

Article: England defender Jess Carter said she felt a sigh of relief when her non-Black teammates missed penalties during their shootout win over Sweden in the Women’s Euro 2025 quarterfinals, fearing Lauren James would suffer “astronomical” racist abuse if the forward had been the only player to miss her spot-kick. “It’s horrible to say but it’s almost like a sigh of relief when other players that weren’t Black missed a penalty, because the racism that would have come with LJ (James) being the only one that missed would have been astronomical,” Carter told United Kingdom broadcaster ITN on Monday. “It’s not because we want them to fail – it’s about knowing how it’s going to be for us (England’s Black players) if we miss.” Carter said in July that she had been the target of online racist abuse since Euro 2025 began in Switzerland and announced that she is stepping away from social media for the duration of the tournament. She also admitted to feeling fear when England manager Sarina Wiegman informed her she would be playing in the final against Spain, which England won 3-1 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. “I think it was a mixture of such a big game, but then on top of that (I was) scared of whatever abuse might come with it, whether it’s football-based or whether it was going to be the racial abuse that was going to come with it because I did something wrong.”

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that "all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same." Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. Reaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes - tariffs - on almost every country on earth. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. warn of price hike as new tariffs set to take effect "By overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,'' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. "The administration's desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris."

Article: A survey of 500 pharmacies by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) also found 87% had experienced at least one instance of intimidating behaviour towards workers, while 22% said they had seen staff physically assaulted. "I'm not just talking about petty crime, small incidents of shoplifting, I'm seeing wanton vandalism," he told BBC Breakfast, noting instances of what he believed were "sinister organised crimes, where people are trying to access our dispensaries". Mr Cohen said: "Every incident of crime in our pharmacy isn't just a statistic but it makes my staff feel unsafe and it also stops our patients accessing healthcare." The NPA says pharmacies have tightened security, including bringing in private security guards, employing body cameras and panic buttons, and installing CCTV and security shutters. Last month, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed retailers in England and Wales have seen the highest levels of shoplifting since records began more than two decades ago. When asked about whether it was appropriate for images of known shoplifters to be displayed in places such as shop windows, she replied: "It's on all of us to be aware of what is going on in our local communities." Nick Kaye, the former NPA chair, noted that instances of aggression were not always linked to shoplifting, but were often people going into pharmacies after being let down by other parts of the NHS.

Article: Thailand’s army is warning that it may have to“exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines Thailand warns it may act in 'self-defense' after soldier hurt by a mine blast near Cambodian border BANGKOK -- Thailand’s army warned that it may have to “exercise the right of self-defense” in response to continuing incidents it blames on Cambodia, in which Thai soldiers patrolling along the two countries’ border have been wounded by land mines. Winthai Suvaree said a sergeant was patrolling the border with seven other soldiers Tuesday morning when he ”stepped on an anti-personnel landmine covertly planted by the Cambodian side, resulting in severe injuries to his left ankle.” The incident and the Thai reaction indicates the precariousness of the ceasefire that took effect on July 29 with the aim of ending five days of armed clashes over disputed territory along their border. “This incident serves as clear evidence that the Cambodian side has violated the ceasefire agreement and shows no respect for international humanitarian law, particularly the Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use and placement of all types of anti-personnel landmines,” said the Thai army statement about the latest incident. The statement noted the multiple similar incidents and declared that Thailand “has consistently adhered to peaceful approaches and has not been the initiating party.” “However, should circumstances become compelling, it may be necessary to exercise the right of self-defense under international law principles to resolve situations that cause Thailand to continuously lose personnel due to violations of ceasefire agreements and sovereignty encroachments by Cambodian military forces,” it warned. “Cambodia, as a proud and responsible State Party to the Ottawa Convention, maintains an absolute and uncompromising position: we have never used, produced, or deployed new landmines under any circumstances, and we strictly and fully honor our obligations under international law,” she said, echoing previous official denials. Ly Thuch, senior minister and first vice-president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, noted that Cambodia has cleared more than 1 million mines and nearly 3 million other pieces of unexploded ordnance left over from more than three decades of war and civil unrest that began in 1970, according to an interview with the Cambodian state news agency AKP.

European leaders, including Zelenskyy, are set to meet for a virtual summit later on Tuesday, which will reportedly focus on ways to pressure Russia, the fate of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and possible security guarantees for Kyiv. When asked about how the EU could react should Trump agree to cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia, she said: "How would that work in practice, like really, if Ukraine doesn't agree to this, then how would it really work?" Putin clearly just wants concessions, she said, adding that before any talks about ceding territory, a ceasefire should be discussed. Hungary, which has previously created hurdles for the approval of EU sanctions against Russia, this week chose not to endorse a statement by the bloc that said Ukraine must be free to decide its own future.

In fact, based on mortality rates, it seems that lung cancer is only a problem in South Africa — the richest country in the region — and, in particular, the Western Cape — the province with the most efficient and well-resourced health care system. toggle caption Simar Bajaj for NPR Africa's hidden lung cancer epidemic, as Koegelenberg calls it, is part of a larger crisis in global health, as infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV have increasingly come under control and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become an existential threat. Sponsor Message Why lung cancer goes undiagnosed There are almost no nerve endings in the lungs, so in the early stages, the most common symptom of lung cancer is no symptom at all, says Dr. "Patients would go through the whole treatment regimen for tuberculosis and not really be investigated for lung cancer," says Lorraine Govender, a nurse and the national manager of health promotion at The Cancer Association of South Africa. Those lost six to nine months of possible treatment can be deadly, since 55% of people with lung cancer die within a year, according to Cancer Research UK "The lack of training for health care providers to identify lung cancer is a big problem," she adds. Tuberculosis may play an even more direct role, given that patients with this disease are twice as likely to get lung cancer than those without — likely due to this bacterial disease causing lung inflammation and DNA damage. "In Africa, where we don't have the screening and diagnosis available, we may see deaths from cancer but not know what cancer the patient actually died from," Govender says, "or maybe have deaths and not know it was cancer." Sponsor Message Autopsies could help answer these questions but are rarely performed for religious and cultural reasons, says Dr. Okonta thinks sub-Saharan Africa is in a catch-22 on lung cancer, where systemic undercounting leads to limited data and limited data allows governments to ignore this disease and the need for better record-keeping. "Once you are actually so far gone, there's really no point." toggle caption Simar Bajaj for NPR Skyrocketing smoking rates across sub-Saharan Africa means the lung cancer problem is likely to get worse, as tobacco companies target the region to replace falling sales in the West. Especially at risk are communities like Khayelitsha, a racially segregated township on the outskirts of Cape Town, as tobacco companies often flood poor areas with cheap cigarettes and aggressive marketing. Mbulelo Shicani, a lung cancer patient here, says that he buys a pack of cigarettes for 10 rand, or 50 cents, and that these prices have actually been coming down . "We obviously diagnose lung cancer a lot better compared to the rest of the country and the rest of the continent," Mnguni says, given that the Western Cape has the strongest health care system in South Africa and perhaps all of sub-Saharan Africa. and lung cancer patients only receive palliative care upon diagnosis" — For those in Khayelitsha, they're almost always facing such advanced disease that "we don't even refer them to the oncologist," Mnguni says. Why screening isn't an easy solution One way to find tumors and treat them early is with lung cancer screening , especially given that pharmaceutical companies , such as AstraZeneca and Chinese firm BGI Genomics, see Africa as a key region for innovation and investment. So, in 2019, Koegelenberg and Dheda created the first lung cancer screening guidelines in sub-Saharan Africa, and Discovery, the largest private health-insurance provider in South Africa, started covering screening several months ago, Koegelenberg says. Dheda openly acknowledges that lung cancer screening isn't practical for the 84% of South Africans in the public system, or even most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, "although we should be screening and we know we should be screening," he says. Even if there were enough CT scanners to screen high-risk individuals, there wouldn't be capacity to biopsy nodules and treat all these cases, given budget shortfalls and rapidly growing waitlists. "For most limited resource countries, the best bet is to prevent people from getting the disease." This too is easier said than done, given pressure from tobacco companies and the need for greater social support to help people manage addiction. "What are you going to offer in the place of smoking when communities are living in stress?" Change may be on the way Despite these challenges, Meyer is hopeful about the future. South African lawmakers are considering a new smoking law that would ban all tobacco and e-cigarette advertising, as well as raise penalties to 15 years of jail time for businesses that sell tobacco to children or at cut-rate low prices. Furthermore, recent research from Vietnam suggests that lung cancer screening might be feasible with chest x-rays and artificial intelligence , which is a more realistic, scalable option for sub-Saharan Africa, Koegelenberg says. "Maybe the government will start paying attention to lung cancer." "We must stop hiding behind, 'Oh, it's not going to be affordable,'" Meyer says, since the cost of inaction is far too high. "We must just do it."

Article: A Chinese warship crashed into one of its own country’s coast guard vessels as it chased a patrol boat belonging to the Philippines, officials in Manila said Monday, after the latest territorial dispute in the South China Sea. The dramatic collision near the Scarborough Shoal, a contested island, came as the Filipino vessel was delivering fuel and supplies to more than 30 fishing boats, the country’s coast guard said in a statement Monday. Several videos posted on X by Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson for the Philippines Coast Guard, showed the Chinese ships on both sides of their coast guard vessel, traveling at quite a pace. Another video showed the Chinese coast guard ship bearing the number 3104, appears to be bearing down on the back of the Filipino boat, when the warship appears from the left of shot in front. Instead, it accused the Philippines of “intruding into waters” under the “pretext” of supplies, near the island which it called China’s “inherent territory.” It said it had acted in a “professional, regulated and lawful” manner. The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs said in its statement that it was “seriously concerned” by China’s “dangerous maneuvers.” The collision demonstrated the “importance of adhering to international maritime rules,” it said, adding that the crew of the patrols ship had “without hesitation offered medical aid and other relevant support to the Chinese side.” It is unclear whether this offer was accepted. Beijing claims sovereignty in over 80% of the South China Sea, energy-rich waters with estimated 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil below them. In the last decade, China has been been actively building artificial islands in the region and added military bases, ports, and airstrips, drawing criticism from the Philippines and Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, who also lay claim to parts of the South China Sea. In 2016, an international court ruled overwhelmingly in favor of the Philippines, declaring that many of China’s claims and actions in the South China Sea violated international law and rights of the Philippines.

Article: On August 5, 2019, the Indian government stripped the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state of its special status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, split it into two entities and demoted the two units to Union Territories under New Delhi’s direct control. The bombshell that came on the sixth anniversary was an official order banning 25 books that focus on Jammu and Kashmir’s history and politics – all accused of promoting “false narratives” and “secessionism” – a sweeping judgement that does not stand the test of scrutiny and is not based on any evidence. The government justified the actions of August 5, 2019 on the grounds that they would usher in peace and development in the region, while glossing over the unprecedented physical and cyber-restrictions imposed across the erstwhile state, during which thousands of people, including pro-India politicians (three former chief ministers included), were arrested. Barbed wire and military barricades turned the region, particularly the Kashmir Valley, into a curfewed zone, and communication channels – from internet to telephone lines – were pushed into some black hole. Advertisement Six months later, when some of these restrictions were slightly eased and the internet was partially restored, the stranglehold of the Indian state became even more oppressive, with an exacerbation of raids and crackdowns against journalists, political and social activists, and civil rights defenders. The policy of widespread detentions under laws like the Public Safety Act, which allows the government to detain anyone without charge for up to two years, was ramped up significantly. Focused on the first two years of the revocation of Article 370, and in 12 chapters, I documented what was happening on the ground – the increased suppression of the masses, the lack of space for freedom of expression, the shrinking space for civil society and political activism, the criminalisation of dissent, the continuation of terrorism as opposed to the claims of peace and normalcy, and the hollowness of the development claims by the government even as the new policies and actions robbed the people of their homes and agricultural lands. A paranoid state whose only method of engagement in Jammu and Kashmir is through increasing its military footprint, merciless subjugation of the residents and silencing of all voices of dissent was obviously uncomfortable with what I documented. Advertisement In the last six years, the government has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the world by trumpeting its achievements of bringing peace, normalcy, tourism and development. The ban on 25 books, many of which provide rich, well-researched, and layered historical, political and legal narratives about the complex and trouble-torn region, is an extension of the pattern. Though senseless, shocking and irrational in scale and scope, the ban, which ironically coincides with a government-backed Chinar Book Festival in Srinagar, sends a chilling message: Knowledge and information will be regulated by the state. Last year, during Jammu and Kashmir’s first assembly elections as a Union Territory, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, took a dig at the regional political parties and alleged that while “they (local politicians) gave the youth stones in their hands”, his government had given them “books and laptops”. The hollowness of such claims is laid bare when the daily reality is one of confiscation of digital devices, including laptops, during raids and interrogations, alongside a blanket book ban that only reinforces the central message of my work: Kashmir is anything but normal.

Article: A Texas woman is suing a key group that provides abortion pills by mail and a former sexual partner, who she alleges terminated her pregnancy by lacing her drink with medication he obtained from the group. In the complaint, filed Monday in Texas federal court by a prominent antiabortion attorney, the woman alleges that her ex-partner bought the pills from Aid Access, a nonprofit based in Europe, then pressured her to take them for weeks in the spring, even though she told him she did not want an abortion. doctors affiliated with the group have been able to mail the medication to patients in all 50 states under the protection of “shield” laws designed to safeguard providers from prosecution in states with abortion bans. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The wrongful-death lawsuit alleges that Aid Access violated the federal Comstock Act, an 1873 law that bans the mailing of “obscene” materials, including those related to abortion. Advertisement The attorney behind the case is Jonathan Mitchell, who is known for counseling private citizens on suing people who facilitate abortions — and who designed the Texas law that enables such cases. (The Post is not naming the woman because of the nature of her allegations in the civil suit.) Advertisement Advertisement Monday’s complaint appears to be the first time a woman has filed a wrongful-death abortion lawsuit in federal court. “Some of this is having that really sympathetic case and saying, ‘Look how irresponsible the defendants were, that they were willing to give whomever these medications and that person took it and used it in nefarious ways,’” said Carmel Shachar, a law professor at Harvard Law School. Advertisement She did so, the lawsuit says, because she “viewed this as a last-ditch opportunity to get on reasonable terms.” On April 5, he visited the woman’s home and made her hot chocolate, according to the complaint. When asked about the alleged incident, a spokesperson for the department said Corpus Christi police had “a few reports involving those individuals” but no active investigations as of Monday afternoon. Wade was overturned, abortion advocates have worried that conservatives would use the Comstock Act as a legal vehicle to shut down abortion pill mailing, a network propelled by Aid Access. Attempts from conservative attorneys and state prosecutors, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), to legally target providers affiliated with Aid Access, which is incorporated in Austria, and other physicians who practice under shield laws have stalled thus far. The new effort from Mitchell, the woman’s attorney, couples the Comstock Act with state law, as he did last month in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the California doctor, which also cited the federal law.

Article: As hundreds of thousands of dogs ranged as usual around the back streets of India’s capital on Tuesday morning, it was the city’s humans, dog lovers in particular, who were howling. On Monday, the Supreme Court of India, with its offices in the center of New Delhi, ruled that the current legal practices for taking care of the city’s stray dog population were inadequate. The court’s order seemed to contradict the Animal Birth Control law, which requires strays to be vaccinated, sterilized and then returned to the places where they had been picked up.

Article: Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added.

Article: Finland Moomins Fans celebrate the 80th anniversary of the publication of the Finnish children's classic, "The Moomins and The Great Flood," and the birthday of the author Tove Jansson, in Tampere, Finland, Saturday, Aug. (AP Photo/Tommi Ojala) Finland Moomins Fans celebrate the 80th anniversary of the publication of the Finnish children's classic, "The Moomins and The Great Flood," and the birthday of the author Tove Jansson, in Tampere, Finland, Saturday, Aug. The series, set in the fictional Moominvalley, has been translated into more than 60 languages, and sparked movie and TV adaptations, children's plays, art gallery exhibitions and an eponymous museum — plus theme parks in Finland and Japan. On Saturday, fans flocked to Tampere in southern Finland — home of the Moomin Museum — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the 1945 publication as well as Jansson's Aug. "I just carried that love for Moomin, for Tove Jansson, with me into my adult life.” When Senn met her now-wife, Lizzie, they were initially in a long-distance relationship for the first year and a half. “You buy a Moomin mug, you like the characters, you maybe see something on TV — but we all go back to the books, the original illustrations.” Depictions of the character Stinky, described as a lovable rogue who has captured Moominmamma’s heart, generated debate and outcry in Finland this summer after reports emerged in Finnish media that Stinky was removed from a mural in an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library in New York due to concerns that the cartoon might be perceived as racist. “A single image of Stinky was removed from the youth wing — which had the potential to be negatively misconstrued by young children without a fuller understanding of the Moomin universe,” the library said Monday in a statement to The Associated Press. "However, Stinky does appear in other areas of the exhibition and the Moomins books remain available for patrons to check out as they always have.” Jansson's drawings of Stinky shows the character with a dark, fuzzy body, with skinny legs and antennae. “To me, this became as quite a big surprise because I have more thought about Stinky being close to a mole or a vole," Sirke Happonen, a Moomins scholar and associate professor at the University of Helsinki, said of the library's decision. Her partner of more than 45 years, engraver and artist Tuulikki Pietilä, was memorialized as the character Too-ticky in “Moominland Midwinter.” The couple lived in Helsinki and spent their summers on the small rocky island of Klovharu in the Gulf of Finland until the 1990s. She felt it was very difficult to paint, and she started writing what she called a fairy tale, but she excused herself not to include princesses or princes,” Happonen said.

(Firecrest Films via AP, Pool) In this image made from pool video footage, Nicholas Rossi accused of faking his death and fleeing to Europe to avoid rape charges, appears at a jury trial in Salt Lake City, Monday, Aug. (Firecrest Films via AP, Pool) SALT LAKE CITY -- A man accused of faking his death and fleeing to the United Kingdom to avoid rape charges faced an alleged victim in court Monday as a jury trial in Utah began. Rossi, 38, was arrested in Scotland in 2021 — a year after he was reported dead — when he was recognized at a Glasgow hospital while receiving treatment for COVID-19. The woman, who the judge asked not be identified publicly, described a whirlwind relationship with Rossi that began in November 2008 while she was recovering from a traumatic brain injury. Rossi's lawyers sought to convince the jury that the alleged victim built up years of resentment after Rossi made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship, and accused him of rape to get back at him a decade later when she saw him in the news. And when you start going through everything, you're not going to get a complete picture.” Prosecutors pushed back, saying that if any “puzzle pieces” are missing, it's because Rossi's attorneys fought to have some evidence dismissed.

Article: Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know By ISABEL DEBRE Associated Press and PAOLA FLORES Associated Press Bolivian presidential candidate Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga attends his campaign rally ahead of the upcoming presidential election, in La Paz, Bolivia, Thursday, Aug. Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth. In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin. The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president — both of whom have run and lost three times before — and a young leftist Senate leader. “The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers. “But the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,” Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom. A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia’s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term. Dubbed the “eternal candidate,” he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia’s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader's popularity. Now once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size. “These are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization." Doria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation's foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising “No more lines!” If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales.

The man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, was armed with five guns, including at least one long gun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. A union representing workers at the CDC said the shooting was not random and “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured." It demanded federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation, saying it was putting scientists at risk. Here's what to know about the shooting and the continuing investigation: Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. The police chief added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.” The Georgia Bureau of Investigations said the crime scene was “complex” and the investigation would take “an extended period of time." The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said the CDC and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning vaccine disinformation.” Such a public statement by federal officials is needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news release. is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC’s workforce through "his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust.” Kennedy reached out to staff on Saturday, saying “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.” In a statement provided Monday, HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy “has unequivocally condemned the horrific attack and remains fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of CDC employees.” Nixon added that Rose's “sacrifice to protect the CDC on its darkest day will never be forgotten.” Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the campus. “Forcing a return under these conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and shared with staff. A neighbor of White's told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in unrelated conversations.

Article: Tesla is recruiting test drivers in New York to operate cars with "automated driving systems," but the company hasn't applied for the permits it would need to test autonomous vehicles in the nation's largest city. The hires will be "responsible for driving an engineering vehicle for extended periods, conducting dynamic audio and camera data collection for testing and training purposes." A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation told CNBC on Monday that Tesla has not applied for approvals to test AVs on city streets in New York. Any company that obtains a permit to test AVs in New York has to keep "a trained safety driver behind the wheel, ready to take control of an AV-enabled vehicle at all times," according to the DOT spokesperson. Tesla's EV sales have been on the decline this year, especially in Europe, partly due to Musk's decision to focus on the Cybertruck, rather than producing a more affordable EV with mainstream appeal. Some of the company's struggles are the result of a political backlash against Tesla because of Musk's incendiary political rhetoric, work with President Donald Trump, and endorsements of Germany's anti-immigrant AfD party. Along with its recruiting efforts in Queens, Tesla is also seeking to hire test drivers for its Autopilot team to gather data from drives in cities and suburbs of Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando and Miami, as well as Palo Alto, California, home to Tesla's engineering headquarters.

Article: The soldier’s left ankle was badly damaged on Tuesday after he stepped on the device while patrolling about 1km (0.6 miles) from the Ta Moan Thom Temple in Thailand’s Surin province, the army said. The statement warned that if violations continued, Thailand might “exercise the right of self-defence under international law principles to resolve situations that cause Thailand to continuously lose personnel due to violations of ceasefire agreements and sovereignty encroachments by Cambodian military forces”. “Cambodia, as a proud and responsible State Party to the Ottawa Convention, maintains an absolute and uncompromising position: we have never used, produced, or deployed new landmines under any circumstances, and we strictly and fully honour our obligations under international law,” the Cambodian Ministry of National Defence said in a social media post. Those battles, the worst between the neighbours in more than a decade, saw exchanges of artillery fire and air strikes that killed at least 43 people and displaced more than 300,000 on both sides. Thailand has accused Cambodia of planting mines on its side of the border, which stretches 817km (508 miles), with ownership of the Ta Moan Thom and 11th-century Preah Vihear temples at the heart of the dispute.

Article: President Donald Trump, joined by Republican lawmakers, signs the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act into law during an Independence Day military family picnic on the South Lawn of the White House on July 04, 2025 in Washington, DC. The CBO estimates that the 10% of poorest Americans will lose roughly $1,200 a year as they experience restrictions on government programs like Medicaid and food assistance, while the richest 10% of Americans will see their income increase by $13,600 from tax cuts. Overall, American households will see more income from the tax cuts in the legislation, including middle income households, but the largest benefit will go to the top 10% of earners. "CBO has a troubled track record of getting its estimates incorrect and, like Democrats, is biased in favor of more federal spending and higher taxes," Smith said on social media. "Don't buy it." Republicans have been eager to sell the upsides of the legislation — arguing that the tax cuts will spur economic growth — while they are on a monthlong summer break from Washington. "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill is putting America First like never before, delivering huge savings for hardworking families, boosting our economy, and securing our borders," said White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson in a statement last week.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: Presented with data showing job growth in the United States slowing to a 16-year low, the president fired Erica McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics without cause. He proceeded to tell Americans that his own administration’s job numbers should be seen as “rigged,” “ridiculous,” “phony” and a “scam” — baseless claims that the Republican appeared to make up to justify his own outlandish and authoritarian-style decision. In other words, Trump has already decided that the economy is in great shape, reality notwithstanding, and he’s confident that his handpicked loyalist will produce statistics that meet the White House’s standards for “accuracy.” In the same missive, the Republican described Antoni as a “Highly Respected Economist.” There’s ample evidence to the contrary. Jason Furman, for example, is an accomplished Harvard economist who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, and he responded to Antoni’s nomination this way: “I don’t think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise.” Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, added, “Let’s focus on qualifications: Antoni finished grad school 5 years ago at Northern Illinois with no distinction. Going forward, everyone — from policymakers to economists, Federal Reserve officials to investors, business owners to regular ol’ American workers — will now have reason to question the integrity of the data from the U.S.

Article: inflation was unchanged in July while a measure of underlying inflation rose to its highest level in five months as tariffs push the price of imported goods higher while gas and grocery prices cooled. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. WATCH: As Trump’s tariffs kick in, economist breaks down inflation and recession warning signs The figures suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Tariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. WATCH: Firing of labor statistics head undermines trust in key data, ex-Trump official warns Adding to the BLS’s turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump’s 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.

Steel plant in Pennsylvania The explosion sent black smoke spiraling into the midday Monday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. In a statement, the United Steelworkers, which represents many of the Clairton plant’s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” U.S. The county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors, but lifted the advisory later Monday. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S.

It came after the White House said it would issue a clarification on what it labeled "misinformation" on gold bar tariffs. @GC.1 5D line Gold futures Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, was already bullish on gold — whether or not it was subject to the Trump administration's tariffs regime. He told CNBC earlier this week that he believes gold prices could exceed his $4,000 target price, adding on Tuesday that the president's confirmation that the metal is exempt from so-called reciprocal tariffs frees up room for gold to soar to new heights. This means that the bull market in the yellow metal may only be in its very first inning." Tariffs 'create havoc on the ground' UBS is also forecasting an increase in the price of spot gold. "The recent debacle over the US's gold import classifications signals how tariff pronouncements, interpretations, and subsequent practical application by different parts of the Trump administration can create havoc on the ground," they said. They added that "dramatic events are hard to forget," arguing that even with clarification of a tariff exemption from the White House, the earlier confusion was likely to have some lasting impact on gold investors' mindsets. "Our benchmark target for the London spot price is USD 3,500/oz by end-2025, with even greater upside if economic or geopolitical risks step higher." Uncertainty persists The tariffs exemption for gold came at no surprise for markets, Michael Hsueh, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, told CNBC on Tuesday. The spread of the EFP, or exchange for physical trading strategy, to which Hsueh referred is a measure of the price difference between gold futures in New York and spot prices in London.

Article: Before stepping back into the Oval Office in January, United States President Donald Trump promised numerous times that he would broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine “within 24 hours”. “Between Putin’s senile stubbornness and Trump’s spontaneousness, everything can still change 100 times over,” said Katherine, a St Petersburg pensioner who asked that her surname be withheld because she feared repercussions. “God willing, they agree to end the war, of course.” In recent months, Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin’s unwillingness to halt attacks on Ukraine, calling recent strikes on Kyiv “disgusting”. It is clear this meeting is a symbolic victory for Russia by the very fact it is being held, regardless that no one expects any results from it,” Budraitskis told Al Jazeera. “It is a proof of the effectiveness of [Putin’s] strategy, which is that there is no need to make any compromises – you need to stubbornly repeat your maximalist positions, and at some point, everyone will be so tired of this that they will be forced to accept them, and the international isolation of Russia will gradually disappear.” Budraitskis believes the meeting holds a similar value for Trump. “What the symbolic meaning of this meeting is for Trump is in showing he continues to play a key role in the situation in Ukraine, that he is the only person who is capable of talking to Putin, whom Putin listens to and respects.” While Russia currently occupies vast chunks of eastern Ukraine, Ukraine no longer occupies any Russian territory after being ousted from the Kursk region of western Russia earlier this year. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Russian and US diplomats were hammering out a deal that would allow Russia to keep the territory it has conquered so far, halting its invasion along the existing battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of southern Ukraine. The Polish online newspaper Onet said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff proposed to Putin a de facto recognition of what the Kremlin considers its “new territories” and the lifting of sanctions. Advertisement Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fired back in a Telegram post on Saturday, reiterating: “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.” But Zelenskyy will not be present at Friday’s meeting. “This is an eloquent signal that both Trump and Putin understand the destructive position of Zelenskyy and European officials for the development of mutually acceptable agreements, who, by the way, are persistently trying to include the Ukrainian leader in the agenda of the event.” Budraitskis said certain token measures may be granted without seriously hindering the war effort. “It’s possible that Putin will take some symbolic steps, for example limiting or temporarily refraining from bombing Ukraine, because, in general, this aerial warfare does little to help advance Russian troops.” Although Putin and Trump have spoken several times by phone this year, Friday’s talks will mark the first face-to-face meeting between the two statesmen since they met in Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, but because the United States is not a member of the ICC, it is under no obligation to arrest him.

Article: DALLAS — A week after the DallasNews Corporation board called a shareholder meeting to vote on a proposed merger with Hearst, competing bidder Alden Global Capital increased its buyout offer. 4, the DallasNews Board called for a meeting and asked shareholders to approve the proposed merger with Hearst, calling it "the superior offer." "We are perplexed by your refusal to have a single discussion with us in the weeks since our original proposal was submitted," MNG wrote in a letter to the board. Today, we are submitting this Enhanced Proposal to further demonstrate our commitment to a transaction between MNG and DallasNews." The DallasNews said in its letter to shareholders that Robert W. Decherd previously stated that he will never agree to a buyout offer from Alden Global Capital, and the board argued that without Decherd's approval, a buyout agreement could not be reached. "Should Alden thwart the Hearst Merger, it will have succeeded only in destroying tens of millions of dollars of potential shareholder value represented by the Hearst Merger," the DallasNews said in a press release. "You should not summarily dismiss an offer that is clearly better for Dallas News’ shareholders and the readers of The Dallas Morning News alike." Alden has attracted controversy for focusing on cost-cutting at the newspapers it owns, according to the Dallas Business Journal. By 2018, the newsroom had shrunk by nearly two-thirds to around 70, prompting the editorial board of the Post to publish a public rebuke of Alden, the Dallas Business Journal reported. In a letter to the board, Alden said it is committed to maintaining the print edition of The Dallas Morning News and respects the newspaper's service to the North Texas community.

Article: A dating app, a niqab and a 9mm gun - how a US woman was hired to end a UK family feud 49 minutes ago Share Save Caroline Gall BBC News, West Midlands Lauren Potts BBC News Share Save Police handout US citizen Aimee Betro had virtually no "criminal footprint" before the shooting in Birmingham, UK, police say On an autumn night six years ago, Betro pointed a 9mm gun at Sikander Ali in a suburban cul-de-sac and pulled the trigger, as she had been hired to do. Police handout Betro, pictured in a shop in Birmingham, was extradited to the UK from Armenia earlier this year In 2018, Mohammed Aslam and his son Mohammed Nabil Nazir were injured during a fight at a shop owned by Mr Ali's father, Aslat Mahumad. The clash sparked a violent feud between the families, Birmingham Crown Court heard, which "clearly led Nazir and Aslam to conspire to have someone kill Aslat Mahumad or a member of his family". The pair, from Derby, turned to Betro - a woman not known by police "to have a huge footprint criminally" in the US or anywhere, according to Det Ch Insp Alastair Orencas from West Midlands Police's major crime unit. "On the face of it, a normal-looking individual [but] prepared to do an outrageous, audacious and persistent murder." Police handout Betro was captured firing directly at the family home in Measham Grove Betro, a childhood development and graphic design graduate from the US city of West Allis, arrived in the UK in August 2019 to carry out Aslam and Nazir's vendetta. The court heard she had previously met Nazir via a dating app and slept with him at an Airbnb in London's Kings Cross during a visit to the UK between December 2018 and January 2019, although it remains unclear how she came to be hired to carry out the shooting. Scoping out house On the day of the shooting, Betro - wearing a summer dress, hoodie and flip-flops - bought a second-hand Mercedes from a garage in Alum Rock under the name Becky Booth. When Mr Ali pulled up, she got out and fired the gun directly at him but it did not discharge, prompting him to jump back in his car and flee. West Midlands Police Bullets went through the windows of the house Betro initially fled the scene but returned by taxi just after midnight and fired three shots at the family home. Days later, Nazir followed and according to Betro, the pair rented a car and drove to Seattle "just for a road trip" with stops at an amusement park, Area 51 in Nevada, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The investigation to find Betro and bring her co-conspirators to justice not only spanned several years but was hampered by the pandemic and involved the FBI, National Crime Agency and two UK police forces. West Midlands Police Mohammed Aslam (left) and his son Mohammed Nazir were jailed in November From the start, Betro denied her involvement and told the trial it was "all just a terrible coincidence" that she was around the corner from the scene of the attempted assassination six minutes later. "I think [she] has had a somewhat problematic relationship with the truth in not accepting what she was accused of." Asked if he believed Betro was paid or had acted out of loyalty to her partner Nazir, the officer said: "We've not seen evidence of payments.

Article: The choice of Alaska — a territory the United States purchased from the Russian Empire 158 years ago — for talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is being seen as symbolic by some Russian commentators who are framing it as a nod to historic ties and a chance for closer relations in future. It appears that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not been invited to the summit about the war in his homeland and representatives from Europe have also been excluded, fueling Kyiv’s worst fears that its future might be decided without its input. added that it seemed “quite logical for our delegation to simply fly across the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held specifically in Alaska.” Russian Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov also called the location “very wise,” in an interview on Tuesday with the state-owned news channel Russia24. He added that it was “very far from Ukraine,” which is around 5,000 miles away of Alaska and “very far from, unfortunately, Europe, which is now largely hostile to us.” Russian commentators also praised the choice of Alaska. Among them is Alexander Bobrov, who in an editorial for the state-controlled Russian broadcaster RT on Monday, wrote the summit was “more than just a meeting between two leaders,” and a “return to the logic of direct dialogue without intermediaries.” St. Felipe Sanchez / Alamy file The summit in Alaska — where Russian Orthodox churches still dot the landscape and place names like Nikolaevsk and Voznesensk speak to their shared history — could help build ties across the Bering Strait, which separates the two countries, Bobrov said. “Alaska’s story began as Russian, continued as American — and now has the chance to become a shared chapter, if both sides choose to see it as an opportunity rather than a threat,” he added, referring to Russia's sale of Alaska to the U.S. Ukraine's Zelenskyy said Saturday that any decisions taken without Ukraine were “decisions against peace,” adding, “They will not achieve anything.” The train station and a Christian Orthodox church lie in ruins after Russian bombing in Kostyantynivka, Ukraine, on Monday. Pierre Crom / Getty Images Asked Monday if the Ukrainian president was invited to the Alaska summit Trump said Zelenskyy “wasn’t a part of it” and while he had participated in numerous meetings during the course of the war, little had come of them. European leaders meanwhile, are set to hold a videoconference on Wednesday to to coordinate negotiations to end the war ahead of a separate call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a spokesperson for the German government told Reuters on Tuesday. Sidelined from the Trump-Putin tete-a-tete, a joint statement by European Union leaders on Sunday welcomed Trump’s efforts “towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” but stressed that “a path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.” Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.

Article: Still unclear as the week unfolds: how visible and aggressive the federal presence in Washington would be, how it could play out, who will be targeted — and how long it might last. WASHINGTON (AP) — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation’s capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city’s police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city. “We could contest that,” she said of Trump’s definition of a crime emergency, “but his authority is pretty broad.” Bowser made a reference to Trump’s “so-called emergency” and concluded: “I’m going to work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster.” The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we’re going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump’s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL’s Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. READ MORE: Trump wants the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians to restore their old names She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington’s youth curfew, Chapman said Trump’s latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It’s just about power.” Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. “That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington’s police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. “That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. is ending and ending today.” The action fits a presidential pattern Trump’s declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office: He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer.” In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore.” Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.

Article: The United States and China have extended their tariff deadline for another 90 days, preventing an escalation of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies, with markets rallying after President Donald Trump announced the pause. With the extension, the imposition of higher tariffs on China will be suspended until November 10, with all other elements of an existing truce – which was set to expire on Tuesday – to remain in place. “The United States continues to have discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns,” Trump’s executive order stated, using the acronym for the People’s Republic of China. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a parallel pause on extra tariffs early on Tuesday, with the state media reporting that “a measure to further implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state” would provide stability for the global economy. From early April until then, US import levies on Chinese goods stood at 145 percent, while Chinese tariffs on US exports were 125 percent – rates that resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. Advertisement But the tariff truce agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland, lowered the temperature by temporarily slashing US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent, while Chinese levies on US exports fell to 10 percent. In recent weeks, US-China negotiations have been on a parallel track to other talks Washington has held with trade partners, as it moved to implement sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs – as well as industry-specific levies – on August 7. For Thomas Sampson, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, trade negotiations between the US and China have “been running on their own track … because the US sees China as a long-term economic rival.” Sampson told Al Jazeera that “I don’t think it [Washington] sees the EU or other countries in the same way.” He also noted that the “incipient military rivalry between the US and China” means that bilateral negotiations are sensitive. Flows of rare earth magnets – used in everything from clean energy technology to military hardware – from China to the US rose to 353 tonnes in June, up from just 46 tonnes in May. “Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance told Fox News in an interview. This week’s tariff pause may clear the path for Trump to meet President Xi Jinping in late October, when the president is expected to travel to South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. In the US, economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods has not been fully felt, as many firms have built up their stockpiles of inventories to mitigate the higher duties. For Thomas Sampson, “the tariff pause allows them [the US and China] to maintain the status quo, and it wouldn’t be surprising if, after 90 days, they extend it further.” More broadly, however, he believes that “there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington to push for a de-linking with trade from China.” “Big picture,” he said, “even under a different president, I think you’d still see tensions in the US-China relationship.”

Article: “[Unnamed criminals] fought back against law enforcement last night and they’re not going to be fighting back long because I’ve instructed them and told them whatever happens, you know, they love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform,” Trump said. And I said, ‘You tell them, you spit and we hit,’ and they can hit real hard.” There was, however, a rather obvious problem with Trump’s chest-thumping rhetoric: For all of his apparent concerns for officers, the president maintained very different standards when it came to Jan. 6 rioters, many of whom did far more than just spit on police officers during violent clashes at the Capitol, but who nevertheless received presidential pardons from the Republican just hours after his second inaugural. After this news came to public light, Trump’s DOJ, instead of firing the guy, said about the man who advocated deadly violence against cops, “Jared Wise is a valued member of the Justice Department and we appreciate his contributions to our team.” At the same White House press conference on Monday, the president went on to say that those who “so much as touch” key national landmarks in D.C. will “go to jail for 10 years.” Putting aside the simple fact that Trump can’t simply dictate criminal punishments on the fly, many were also quick to note that the Republican adopted very different standards after Jan. About a month ago during a briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declared from her podium, “This administration wants anyone who has ever committed a crime to be held accountable.” That certainly sounded nice, but it wasn’t long before observers took note of the inconvenient fact that Trump keeps pardoning criminals — including violent felons who attacked police officers on Jan. Customs and Border Protection used its social media platform to issue a statement that read, “Let this be clear: Anyone who assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer or agent in the performance of their duties will be arrested and swiftly prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Attack a cop, and life long consequences will follow!” FBI Director Kash Patel added in a statement of his own: “Hit a cop, you’re going to jail.” Such sentiments obviously should’ve applied to Jan.

Article: The hidden costs of cutting Medicaid Amr Bo Shanab/Getty Images With the passage of the big Republican tax and spending bil l, the federal government is poised to reduce support for Medicaid and the insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. But FQHCs rely on Medicaid patients as their primary source of revenue , and use grant funding from the federal government to cover the costs of providing care to the uninsured. Even with grants amounting to $5.6 billion in 2023 , FQHCs operate on razor-thin margins , and declining Medicaid enrollment following the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated their financial strain. While concern over rural hospital closures led to an additional $50 billion being allocated to a " Rural Health Transformation Program ," an analysis by KFF estimates that this only offsets one-third of the lost revenue from the Medicaid cuts. A paper by economists Craig Garthwaite, Tal Gross, and Matthew Notowidigdo argues that hospitals act as "insurers of last resort." When policy makers cut Medicaid enrollment, hospitals ultimately bear the cost. According to MACPAC (the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission), hospitals provided $22.5 billion worth of uncompensated care to uninsured individuals in 2021, for a total of nearly $40 billion spent on charity care and bad debt (or, around 5 to 6% of hospital expenses). Sponsor Message Medical debt So far, we've found that increasing the uninsured population places financial burdens on two important parts of the social safety net: community health clinics and nonprofit hospitals. Poor health makes us all poorer Being uninsured is, understandably, bad for your health: the uninsured receive less preventative care , have greater difficulty obtaining prescription drugs and dental care, and are less likely to get the specialty care they need.

Elago and five fellow members of the Indigenous Guard trekked across mountainous terrain to confront the guerrillas they suspected of taking her son and another teenager to bolster their ranks. “It was a victory.” Rescue missions like Elago's have intensified for the Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people, which formed in 2001 to protect Indigenous territories from armed groups and environmental destruction such as deforestation and illegal mining. Since 2020, as armed groups tightened their control of Nasa territory to expand illicit crops like marijuana and coca, those guerrillas have ramped up their recruitment of the region's children by dangling offers of cash and protection. Over eight days reporting in the Cauca region, the AP spoke to more than 20 young people affected by the recruitment as well as several families grappling with the same threat. Yet more than 40 Guard members have been slain since the peace deal, according to Colombia’s Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC), a longstanding organization representing Nasa and other Indigenous communities. “They’ve aimed their rifles at us … pressed them to our chests, to our heads.” Elago said the rebels her group confronted three years ago expressed respect for the Guard but claimed the boys had joined voluntarily, which infuriated her. They met with commanders, only to find the 15- and 16-year-old boys did not want to return and were considered by the armed groups to be old enough to decide for themselves. Colombia’s Family Welfare Institute, or ICBF — the main agency protecting children — told AP it funds community programs and Indigenous‑led initiatives that have contributed to 251 children leaving armed groups in the first half of 2025. Her small school in the village of Manuelico — reachable only by a winding road from Caldono — is surrounded by dense forest and coca fields planted and patrolled by armed groups. One young woman who recently fled FARC dissidents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said she joined the armed group at 16 not because she was forced but to escape family problems. As for the parents, she said: “I tell families they need to build trust with their children." Fernández, a woman in her mid-30s who asked to be identified only by her last name for fear of reprisals, was 12 when armed men came looking for her in her rural Cauca community.

Article: The heavily indebted real estate developer, China Evergrande, is set to be delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange on August 25 HONG KONG -- The severely indebted real estate developer China Evergrande, already in the process of liquidation, said on Tuesday it will be delisted from Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Aug. Evergrande was the world’s most heavily indebted real estate developer, with over $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders, when the court handed down a liquidation order in January 2024. “All shareholders, investors and potential investors of the company should note that after the last listing date, whilst the share certificates of the shares will remain valid, the shares will not be listed on, and will not be tradeable on the Stock Exchange," the statement said. The Hong Kong court system has been dealing with liquidation petitions against some Chinese property developers, including one of the largest Chinese real estate companies, Country Garden, which is expected to have another hearing in January. The liquidators said they have assumed control of over 100 companies within the group and entities under their direct management control with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. About $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization “modest." Of this amount, $244 million was derived from subsidiaries’ assets, and not all of them will be available to the company, given the complex ownership structures of the assets. In 2024, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a fine of 4.2 billion yuan (about $584 million) against the firm's subsidiary, Hengda Real Estate Group Company, over violations including falsifying financial records. Chinese authorities in September 2024 banned the accounting firm PwC for six months and fined the company more than 400 million yuan ($56.4 million) over its involvement in the audit of the collapsed property developer.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: A six-year-old Palestinian boy and a 30-year-old man have died from malnutrition, the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza has said, as hunger-related deaths climb and Israeli bombardment continues across the besieged territory. The deaths of Wissam Abu Mohsen and young Jamal Fadi al-Najjar on Tuesday came shortly after Gaza’s Health Ministry said five more people had died of famine within 24 hours, bringing the total number of starvation-related fatalities since the start of Israel’s war to 227, including more than 100 children.. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday urged Israel to allow it to stock medical supplies in Gaza before the military proceeds with its plan to seize Gaza City, a move that has drawn international condemnation. “We want to stock up, and we all hear about ‘more humanitarian supplies are allowed in’, well it’s not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative in the Palestinian territories. “We call on the government of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating.” Israel attacks ‘safe zones’, rescue workers At least 67 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Tuesday, hospital sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera. “A family of four, the al-Nadeem family, has been targeted and a young girl has been rescued, but there are many people trapped under the rubble.” Rescue operations have also come under fire. Footage verified by Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on central Gaza City, with a stream of blood running down the street as people carried a wounded man to a vehicle. Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said Israeli bombardment of Gaza City has intensified for three consecutive days, using “all types of weapons … bombs, drones and also highly explosive munitions that cause massive destruction to civilian homes”. Israel ‘blocking’ food items Israel is also blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into Gaza, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Tuesday. It added that Israel had directly targeted food sources, by not just preventing aid, but deliberately bombing 44 food banks, killing dozens of workers in them, and targeting “57 food distribution centres with bombardment”. Earlier, the Office accused Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the military body reporting on aid deliveries into the enclave, of “a pathetic attempt to cover up an internationally documented crime, the systematic starvation of the population of the Gaza Strip”. This comes a day after Israel targeted and killed a team of Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza City – an attack that has sparked protests in countries across the world. Since May 27, when Israel and the United States introduced the new GHF food distribution system in Gaza, 1,838 Palestinians seeking aid have been killed and more than 13,409 wounded, the ministry said.

Article: WASHINGTON — Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.” The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Frittata brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion. White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS. ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window. The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.” The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC’s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. Every time we win, everybody wins.” Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth. There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. Wherever we ended up, that’s what we’re going to roll with.” White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires.

Article: Mahmud Bassal, a spokesman, said the residential areas of Zeitoun and Sabra had for three days been hit by bombs and drone strikes that "cause massive destruction to civilian homes", with residents unable to recover the dead and injured. The joint statement also demanded an end to the use of lethal force near aid distribution sites and lorry convoys, where the UN says more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by the Israeli military. Separately, the World Health Organisation on Tuesday appealed to Israel to let it stock medical supplies to deal with a "catastrophic" health situation before it seizes control of Gaza City. "We all hear about 'more humanitarian supplies are allowed in' - well it's not happening yet, or it's happening at a way too low a pace," said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative in the Palestinian territories. We need to be able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in." Israel's war cabinet voted on Monday to occupy Gaza City, a move condemned at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council later that day. He also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid in Gaza, including designating safe corridors for aid distribution, as well as more air drops by Israeli forces and other partners. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said that 100 dead had been brought to hospitals across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including 31 people who were killed at aid sites. On Tuesday members of an international group of former leaders known as "The Elders" for the first time called the war in Gaza an "unfolding genocide" and blamed Israel for causing famine among its population. Following a visit to the Gaza border, Helen Clark and Mary Robinson, a former prime minister of New Zealand and a former president of Ireland, said in a joint statement: "What we saw and heard underlines our personal conviction that there is not only an unfolding, human-caused famine in Gaza.

Article: Madonna urges Pope to visit Gaza 'before it's too late' 14 minutes ago Share Save Paul Glynn Culture reporter Share Save Getty Images Madonna released her remix album Veronica Electronica last month Madonna has urged Pope Leo XIV to visit Gaza and bring his "light to the children before it is too late". The US queen of pop shared her plea on social media, saying the supreme pontiff was "the only one of us who cannot be denied entry." Her intervention came as the UK, EU, Australia, Canada and Japan issued a statement saying "famine is unfolding in front of our eyes" and urged action to "reverse starvation". "You are the only one of us who cannot be denied entry." The Like a Prayer singer added: "We need the humanitarian gates to be fully opened to save these innocent children." She signed off by saying: "There is no more time. Love, Madonna." In July, the new Pope renewed his call for a Gaza ceasefire after three people sheltering in the Catholic church in Gaza City were killed in an Israeli strike. According to PA News, he said: "I appeal to the international community to observe humanitarian law and respect the obligation to protect civilians as well as the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force, and the forced displacement of populations." Reuters Pope Leo XIV became the first US head of the Catholic Church in May Madonna - who last month released her long-rumoured remix album Veronica Electronica - has made impassioned speeches on stage about Gaza since the war began. This includes while performing at London's O2 in 2023, when she told fans: "It breaks my heart to see children suffering, teenagers suffering, elderly people suffering - all of it is heartbreaking, I'm sure you agree. "But even though our hearts are broken our spirits cannot be broken." She urged fans to bring "light and love" into the world - both individually and collectively, via words and actions - in order to "bring peace to the Middle East" and beyond. In the caption of her latest online post, she noted how it was her son Rocco's birthday and "the best gift I can give to him as a mother - is to ask everyone to do what they can to help save the innocent children caught in the crossfire in Gaza." The star, who also asked for donations to three different organisations, continued: "I am not pointing fingers, placing blame or taking sides. I pray that they are released as well." U2's solidarity statement Madonna's comments come as U2 frontman Bono - along with the rest of his bandmates - also released a statement letting fans know where they stand on the matter. While condemning the actions of both Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas, the Irish frontman offered: "Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood.

Article: Indeed, to hear the administration tell it, there’s a “public safety crisis” and “public safety emergency” in the District of Columbia, which is reflected in crime in the nation’s capital that is “rising” and “out of control.” The rationale was nonsensical: Crime rates are down across the board in D.C., and violent crime rates have reached a 30-year low. For that matter, at his rambling White House press conference, Trump referenced a handful of other cities by name as if they’d all descended into “Mad Max”-style hellscapes, despite the fact that crime rates have already improved in each of the cities he referenced. President Trump’s decision to send at least 800 National Guard troops into the streets of Washington to fight crime is the latest example of how the president has used the military to advance domestic policy priorities. Americans have, after all, already seen Trump deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles — a spectacularly unnecessary move that proved a debacle in a variety of ways — which roughly coincided with the president deciding to use U.S.

Article: Reports by the French news channel RFI put the number of arrested soldiers at at least 50 while the Reuters news agency reported 36 to 40 soldiers have been detained. Abass Dembele, a former military governor of the northern region of Mopti, was arrested on Sunday morning in his home in Kati, a garrison town just outside Bamako, according to RFI. He was active in the northern war of 2012, a civil war that broke out after Tuareg separatists parlayed with armed groups to seize more than 60 percent of the country. Since 2012, Mali’s army has battled a swarm of armed groups in the north, including Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in the greater Sahara (ISGS). RFI quoted an unnamed Malian senior military officer close to the government as saying the soldiers were arrested because “they wanted to destabilise the transition,” referring to the military government, which calls itself a transitional government that is expected eventually to hand over power to a civilian administration. Advertisement Due to the reported cracks, the military government will want to project a strong image, hence its silence, Beverly Ochieng, a Sahel analyst with the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera. Goita’s government, for example, approved a bill in July that would allow him to seek a five-year presidential mandate, renewable “as many times as necessary” and without requiring an election. This month, former Prime Minister Moussa Mara was arrested and charged with “undermining the credibility of the state” after he visited political prisoners and posted about seeking justice for them. “As long as the night lasts, the sun will obviously appear!” Mara had written on July 4 in a social media post, adding: “We will fight by all means for this to happen as soon as possible!” Choguel Maiga, who was the prime minister until his ouster in November, has also accused Goita’s government of targeting him. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are also military led, banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) this year after they withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States.They also created a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations to try to drive out armed groups. Although there were peace agreements made after the 2012 war that allowed the northern region of Kidal to maintain a semiautonomous nature, the military government under Goita has torn up the peace deals and returned to fighting, forcing hundreds of people to flee across the border to Mauritania.

The July data, which was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, provides a clear sign that businesses are more readily passing along tariff-related costs to their customers after a prolonged period in which price gains were muted. companies that import products have largely been able to hold off on raising prices despite a universal 10 percent tariff that has been in place on all imports since April, along with higher levies on steel, aluminum and products from China and Canada.

Article: Take a look at fed rate cut expectations for the final three meetings of the year relative to where they were on Monday — based on interest rates futures data from the CME Group's FedWatch tool: September: 91.8% chance vs. Take a look at what strategists and investors around Wall Street are saying: Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-CIO of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management: "The Fed is getting the data support that the tariff effect on price level will mostly be transitory. Tariffs have yet to drive substantial price increases, as companies continue to offset cost pressures by drawing down inventories and adjusting prices cautiously due to perceived consumer price sensitivity … In essence, this inflation print supports the narrative of an insurance rate cut in September, which will be a key driving force for the markets." Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital: "Tuesday's CPI data was tame enough that it gives the Federal Reserve the green light to cut rates by at least 25 basis points in September and opens the possibility of a larger 50 basis point cut in September. This data, coupled with the weak July employment report from earlier this month, puts the nail in the coffin for lower interest rates." Josh Jamner, senior investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments: "CPI data that was in-line with expectations will not change the outlook for a September rate cut which was already largely priced into markets, but should provide a boost to risk assets with equities higher and interest rates lower as traders unwind hedges they had put in place to protect against the risk of an upside surprise in the data, which failed to materialize." Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Not as bad as we thought, but I mean, still, this is going to complicate the work of the Fed a bit." Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management: "In this environment stocks can continue to move higher and it is going to take a much larger inflation number – or other shock to the market – for a correction to commence. With many strategists expecting volatility in the months ahead, yet recommending that dips should be bought, it's hard to envision a very large pullback absent an actual recession." Daniel Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity at Janus Henderson Investors: "The July CPI report came in broadly in line with expectations, reinforcing the view that inflation is under control, even if not quite at target. The headline print was contained by falling energy and gasoline prices, while services remained the primary driver of the overall increase." Peter Boockvar, CIO at One Point BFG Wealth Partners: "Both Treasurys and the S & P futures are breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn't higher than expected but 3.1% y/o/y core CPI is still well above 2%. I know some on the Fed and one new member joining temporarily seem to be very confident on how the economic data will play out over the next 4 months but I'm much less confident as the tariff impact will continue to flow through the data and I must say, many service companies too are feeling the higher cost of goods prices, it's not just manufacturers." — CNBC's Sarah Min and Alex Harring contributed reporting.

Article: The move, Ron says, is based on his belief that the era of autonomous big rigs on the roads at scale is here, with the freight industry to be transformed by the economics of driverless technology in the semi cab. The region was chosen as the first area of the nation to deploy the technology at scale due to the massive amount of freight that travels in the Sun Belt, from states including Texas and Arizona to California, and the lack of severe weather conditions like snow and ice (removing one variable for the autonomous technology to navigate). Ron grew Uber Freight to a $5 billion annual revenue business over the past decade, working with one-third of Fortune 500 shippers, according to the company, and managing close to $20 billion in freight overall for clients including Colgate, Nestle, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. The ties between Ron and Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun (the two executives have known each other for a decade) — and between Waabi and Uber — are longstanding. Uber is a major investor in her company, and Uber Freight has been a key partner in testing Waabi's autonomous trucking technology on the roads, with a program underway in Texas since 2023 and an existing goal of deploying across billions of miles. "Over the last four years, we've focused on the product development and R&D, and now we're entering the commercialization phase," said Urtasun, who added that Ron will be focused on the "go-to-market strategy, foundational partnerships such as Uber Freight that push the company to the next level, new partnerships, and positioning the business to scale. Now, he added, "It's about the people who buy the trucks." Ron expects a relatively fast adoption cycle — among both logistics firms looking to replenish freight fleets and shippers, such as major retailers, with their own trucking assets and operations.

Article: US President Donald Trump said he is deploying 800 National Guard soldiers to Washington, DC, and taking control of its police department after claiming that crime was “out of control” in the capital city. The nation’s capital is “becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,” Trump said at an August 11 news conference as he invoked the Home Rule Act to take federal control of the city. “Washington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world, and we’re going to make it that.” But many of the details Trump cited do not stand up to scrutiny. In a news briefing after Trump’s announcement, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the district would cooperate with the federal government and added that she speaks with Trump often about the city’s progress on crime. The executive order says federal use of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order; protect federal buildings and monuments; and ensure “conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.” Trump delegated operational control of the department to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.” Advertisement A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.” Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings. This year, through August 9, there have been 188 carjackings compared with 299 during the same time period in 2024, and compared with 607 in 2023, a police spokesperson told PolitiFact. The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25 percent drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year. “Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster … Somebody murders somebody, and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.” “No cash bail” or “cashless bail” allows certain defendants awaiting trial to be released from custody without paying bail. The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that supports reducing the prison population, measured public safety before and after pretrial reforms in four states and nine cities and counties, including Washington, DC. The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6 percent — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system. A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days”.

Article: Russian forces may have punched a small but significant hole through Ukraine’s front lines, Kyiv-supporting military analysts warned Tuesday, a development that could give Vladimir Putin a boost ahead of his Alaska summit with President Donald Trump. Advanced units have pushed farther into Ukrainian-held territory in the Donetsk region, creating two narrow, 10-mile prongs near the battlefield hot spot town of Pokrovsk, according to watchdogs including Ukraine's Deep State and Washington's Institute for the Study of War, two of the top open-source teams tracking the war's battlefield developments. Already claiming he is winning this war, and refusing to stop fighting unless Ukraine surrenders, Putin could use such a development to lobby for an even more favorable peace deal in Alaska. Evgeniy Maloletka / AP Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with Finland’s Black Bird Group, which tracks the conflict, told NBC News that if the Russians do break through and consolidate, “it could be very bad for the Ukrainians.” This push may have been timed ahead of the Putin-Trump summit, he added. “The Russians have had a tendency to intensify military operations in support of ongoing negotiations so the current events would fit into that picture quite well,” Paroinen said, adding that “we don’t have enough information yet” to be sure. A Ukrainian military spokesperson told NBC News that breakthroughs were being made only by small groups of Russian “infiltrators” — who are being quickly found and “destroyed” by its defending troops — rather than larger units capable of taking and controlling territory. “Of course, the situation there is and remains difficult, and the fighting in this region is the most intense compared to other sections of the front line,” he told NBC News. “However, the Ukrainian troops are making every effort to ensure that even those groups of Russians who managed to infiltrate through the first line are destroyed as soon as possible — which is what happens.” The severity of the situation was made clear by the 1st Azov Corps — seen as among the most adept fighters Ukraine has — announcing Tuesday it had been deployed to the region.

Article: HMRC using AI to scour suspected tax cheats' social media 24 minutes ago Share Save Tom Gerken Technology reporter Share Save Getty Images HMRC has confirmed it uses artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor social media posts as part of criminal investigations into suspected tax cheats. "Greater use of AI will enable our staff to spend less time on admin and more time helping taxpayers, as well as better target fraud and evasion to bring in more money for public services," it said in a statement. "AI could help HMRC to streamline its processes and make it easier to compile all the available information about an individual," accountancy firm RSM UK partner Chris Etherington told the BBC. "There will clearly still need to be a human touch in the process to ensure appropriate decisions are made and all the relevant information is reviewed." The tax authority said it had used AI for several years to support its work, though it first emerged it was being used to monitor the social media accounts of suspected tax cheats when reported by the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.

Article: GENEVA (AP) — Environmentalists and Indigenous leaders held signs Tuesday in front of the United Nations buildings in Geneva, where talks for a global accord to end plastic pollution are taking place, asking nations to show courage and agree to a strong treaty. READ MORE: This sculpture at the UN is covered in more trash each day as nations work toward ending plastic pollution Most were from organizations that are part of the Break Free From Plastic movement. “We’ve invested a lot into coming all the way to Geneva, away from our communities, away from our families, because we understand how important an issue this is and how crucial a moment this is,” said Juressa Lee, who is from New Zealand and was representing the Aotearoa Plastic Pollution Alliance. “Civil society leaders from around the world, together with those most impacted, are speaking with a unified voice that we need to show courage, not compromise, and fix the process.” The head of Panama’s delegation to the talks, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, cheered them on as he walked by. Are they standing for them, their citizens, or big oil?” The biggest issue is whether the treaty should impose caps on producing new plastic or focus instead on things like better design, recycling and reuse. “Because if there is no production, there’s no treaty.” Magnus Heunicke, the Danish environment minister, and Jessika Roswall, the European commissioner for the environment, held a news conference to stress the European Union is in Geneva to get a legally binding, international agreement on how plastic is produced, consumed and disposed. It is not, however, up to the EU.” WATCH: New study highlights ‘grave, growing’ danger of plastic pollution to world’s health Heunicke didn’t specify what they would do if plastic production isn’t in the treaty, since the negotiations are ongoing. If we try to address every single issue that every single country has, they will not reach a deal here.” Momentum has been growing for a proposal led by Mexico and Switzerland for an article to address problematic plastic products, including single-use plastics, and chemicals.

If Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Donald Trump, who has already endorsed U.S. “What I was looking for is someone that can be lieutenant governor that will help us deliver more wins for the people of Florida — and then also that is capable of serving and leading as governor, if that need were ever to arise,” the governor said during the news conference in Tampa, which Collins represents. He went on to join the Army Special Forces and ultimately lost a leg, but continued to serve five more years as a Green Beret post-amputation, according to a campaign biography. The appointment is seen as a way for DeSantis to elevate a potential successor in 2026, though the governor has repeatedly talked up his wife, Casey DeSantis, for the job, while taking shots at Trump’s pick.

Article: The program, called Fanatics ONE, will offer members points for purchases across the company's various businesses, which now include its sports merchandise business, collectibles, and trading cards, as well as casino and sportsbook operations. Tucker Kain, Fanatics' chief strategy and growth officer, said this new loyalty program highlights the company's expansion beyond merchandise, and "the opportunity to bring [it] together from a consumer and experience perspective." Kain said that Fanatics has roughly 10 million people already in its FanCash program, which it previously rewarded to customers who bought merchandise through its ecommerce platform and its app. Fanatics has a vision of building FanCash into "the currency of sport," Kain said, where fans will be able to acquire not just a new jersey or hat, but tickets, athlete meet-and-greets, access to Super Bowl parties, or Fanatics Fest, the company's effort to build a Comic-Con-like event for sports that recently held its second edition. Part of that speaks to the depth of Fanatics' relationships across the sports industry that it has forged since Michael Rubin founded the company, a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, in 2011. It also speaks to the company's growth as it has expanded beyond merchandise into trading cards, collectibles and sports betting, with Fanatics earning more than $8 billion in revenue in 2024. Still, the bulk of the company's revenue comes from its core merchandise business, and this new loyalty program will look to expose more sports gear shoppers to what Fanatics has been doing in collectibles and betting.

Article: But even that level of sustained pickup in deals, he said, "is going to feel like a very busy market after the past few years." Kennedy, whose firm specializes in IPO research, says what he expects from IPO market in the near-term is a possible "return to normalcy" rather than a repeat of the Covid-era IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 — the "crazy levels," as he put it on this week's CNBC "ETF Edge," when there was a burst of deals which saw far too many pre-profit companies go public through not just IPOs but a wave of SPAC offerings. Since the April 8 stock market low fueled by fears about President Trump's trade war, the Renaissance IPO ETF has posted a return of nearly 50%, close to doubling the return of the S&P 500 Index . Investors may need to wait at least a few more years until they get a crack at OpenAI as a public company, according to Renaissance Capital senior strategist Matt Kennedy, but investors who bought into the AI-led IPO market of 2025 have booked big gains already. According to Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, the big gap between the IPO market returns since April and the stock market reflects the broader risk of sentiment, "and what you see is when animal spirits are high, it's typically good for IPOs," he said on "ETF Edge." He pointed to two of the most notable deals from the AI and crypto space: Coreweave and Circle . It has helped the ETF industry too, according to Geraci, with a "monster year" for inflows into spot crypto ETFs — $26 billion in all, with bitcoin ETFs taking in $19 billion and ether ETFs taking in $7 billion. Circle had given back a good deal of its gains since going public, but was still up roughly 50% this year before it reported earnings on Tuesday morning, which led to a new surge in the company's stock price. "There's a saying on Wall Street that when ducks are quacking, feed them, so Circle really accelerated the timeline of a lot of crypto companies waiting to go public," he added. Kennedy said there are plenty of other crypto companies that could follow with offerings, including Grayscale and Gemini, which have both filed for offerings, as well as Kraken, which is rumored to be considering an IPO, and Ripple. He said the current environment, in which AI companies just need to declare themselves open for business to get a billion-dollar valuation is "just crazy," but he added that it will be a "good thing in the long run" for a sustained flow of IPOs in the years ahead. While Kennedy said an OpenAI IPO might not arrive until 2028-2029, there are more than just the biggest-name companies going public that have an AI theme embedded in their business, such as design firm Figma and medtech company Heartflow .

Article: Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and agent accused of sabotaging $240M Hawaii real estate project A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development. A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development. A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island's coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants' misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all - celebrity or not." Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. It called Ohtani "Japan's Babe Ruth" and the "1st Resident," giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, "one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii," Hapuna Beach, "rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler" and two golf courses - one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. "He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training." The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and "as part of a bold marketing strategy" signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, "one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable." "This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project," the investment brochure said. "We see Shohei Ohtani's homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives." The suit said Balelo "quickly became a disruptive force," threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. "Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with (Ohtani) than honoring its obligations to its business partners." Last month, in what the suit called "a coordinated ambush," Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

Article: On Monday, Trump — surrounded by heads of the Defense, Justice and Interior Departments as well as the FBI director — vowed to crack down on criminals and unhoused people living in the nation's capital. "Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people," Trump said as he announced a plan to send in the National Guard and take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for at least the next 30 days. Sponsor Message In an interview with Morning Edition, Schwalb called Trump's move "unprecedented" and said his office was watching closely to ensure the Home Rule Act and constitutional law are being followed. Schwalb spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about the takeover and what legal options his office and residents have if they feel policing becomes unlawful under Trump, who said officers will be able to do "whatever the hell they want." This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Schwalb: So I'm very concerned and my office and I are taking a close look at the very question you're asking about operational control, because even under the Home Rule Act, which gives the president some limited authority, command and control over the police department is not divested from the mayor and the chief of police. The law passed by Congress, the Home Rule Act, provides that the president, under limited special circumstances of an emergency, can request the services of MPD for a federal purpose. And we are watching very closely the facts on the ground as to whether or not Chief [Pamela] Smith, as she said yesterday, is in control of MPD and making command and control decisions for the force. And we're watching very carefully as to whether this is going to change the operations of MPD, because even under the limited authority that the President has under the Home Rule Act, he does not have the authority to take over MPD. Schwalb: I'm concerned about a statement like that, because even when MPD, under the limited circumstances of Section 740 of the Home Rule Act — and by the way, this is totally unprecedented in the history of our city. Our MPD is a professional law enforcement agency committed to professional constitutional policing, and that has to remain, even if the limited circumstances of a Section 740 invocation are in place.

Article: Trump's Washington, DC, takeover begins as National Guard troops arrive Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday. Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called - without substantiation - a lawless city. Still unclear as the week unfolds: how visible and aggressive the federal presence in Washington would be, how it could play out, who will be targeted - and how long it might last. "We could contest that," she said of Trump's definition of a crime emergency, "but his authority is pretty broad." Bowser made a reference to Trump's "so-called emergency" and concluded: "I'm going to work every day to make sure it's not a complete disaster." The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that "we're going to take our capital back," Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of "over policing our youth" with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move "is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power." Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. "That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia." Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington's police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. "That should alarm everyone," she said, "not just in Washington." For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement.

"We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer." In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro - standing next to Trump - called his takeover "the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore."

Article: 'We had too much drama' - meet the Real Housewives of London 14 minutes ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save Real Housewives of London Karen Loderick-Peace, Juliet Mayhew, Panthea Parker, Juliet Angus, Nessie Welschinger and Amanda Cronin are the cast of the Real Housewives of London The Real Housewives franchise has spread around the world, with viewers lapping up the partying and catfighting of wealthy socialites in locations from Orange County to Sydney to Nairobi. For Cronin and her five co-stars - Juliet Angus, Karen Loderick-Peace, Juliet Mayhew, Panthea Parker, and Nessie Welschinger - it's just one of the many dramatic moments as the international franchise arrives in the city. Speaking in a West End hotel, Cronin laughs about how quickly the insult went viral and stands by the fact that her co-star Angus, an American socialite who also appeared in Ladies of London, should be banished from SW3. Getty Images Juliet Angus was sent packing to Paddington in a teaser clip for the show Cronin says she "didn't hesitate" when she was asked to be on the show. "It's just a massive opportunity and such a blessing - to be a housewife is huge so I grabbed it and ran with it." Parker, an Iranian-born north London socialite, admits she had her doubts about joining, but didn't want to live with the regret of turning down such a big franchise. Cronin says: "The producers came to my room one day and said 'You're too strong, your blows are too low and there was too much drama'." Parker adds that producers told her they were doing her a favour by cutting out parts of an argument in the first episode. Getty Images Angus says there wasn't enough drama in 2014 reality TV series Ladies of London Perhaps the reason for so much friction is the fact that the group of six women weren't friends before the show. You just have to own it and life is about making mistakes, rising up, brushing yourself off and starting all over again." The group grew closer "because we spend so much time together filming", she adds. We even got to know each other better than how we know some of our closest friends." Getty Images The Real Housewives of Orange County was the first series in the franchise Before stepping in front of the cameras, the London housewives sought advice from women who had previously been in their positions. Loderick-Peace adds that several existing housewives told her the most important thing was to "just be yourself" - and all the London cast insist they have put their authentic selves on screen. Getty Images Karen has previously appeared on The Real Housewives of Cheshire and Jersey UK Most of the housewives are no strangers to reality TV, and as a result tend to forget the cameras are rolling after a while. Then he was regretting it, but I said he was giving himself too much importance and it was probably only going to be two seconds." Cronin and Loderick-Peace's children chose not to appear, but Welschinger says her whole family, particularly her husband, enjoyed the experience. "I think it was because the production team made you feel safe and they know what they're doing so you can trust the process." Getty Images Amanda Cronin previously dated Wham!

Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year — which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida-based company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The New York Times reported that the White House’s trade tariffs have “intensified price pressures across a wider range of consumer goods and services.” From the article: The Consumer Price Index stayed steady at 2.7 percent compared to the same time last year. Two weeks ago, for example, the Republican sat down with New York Post columnist Miranda Devine and made a rather specific claim — not only about the key economic issue, but about his perceived successes. “Prices are way down for everything — groceries, everything.” But grocery prices are up, not down, and inflation obviously hasn’t been “taken care of.” Indeed, the latest BLS data isn’t the only relevant piece of evidence. Soon after, the Commerce Department reported the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — a metric that’s closely watched by the Federal Reserve for evidence of inflation — is also climbing, and as The New York Times reported, the data represented “the latest sign that President Trump’s tariffs are starting to bleed through into consumer prices.” It’s something to consider the next time he pretends he pushed inflation “way down.” This post updates our related earlier coverage.

Article: “Washington, D.C., should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world, and we’re going to make it that.” President Donald Trump said he is deploying 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department. READ MORE: The nation’s capital finds itself at the center of a Trump maelstrom as National Guard troops arrive In a news briefing after Trump’s announcement, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said the district would cooperate with the federal government and added that she speaks with Trump often about the city’s progress on crime. The executive order says federal use of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order; protect federal buildings and monuments; and ensure “conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.” Trump delegated operational control of the department to U.S. Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.” A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.” Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings. The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25% drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year. “Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said. The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that supports reducing the prison population, measured public safety before and after pretrial reforms in four states and nine cities and counties, including Washington, D.C. mayor Bowser calls Trump takeover of DC police ‘unsettling’ The Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office as evidence that cashless bails cause increased crime. The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6% — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system. A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days.” However, once reversed, the return to cash bail did not affect the number of rearrests.

Asked about threats based on misinformation regarding the CDC and its vaccine work, FBI Special Agent Paul Brown said Tuesday: “We’ve not seen an uptick, although any rhetoric that suggests or leads to violence is something we take very seriously.” “Although we are tracking it, we are sensitive to it, we have not seen that uptick,” said Brown, who leads the FBI’s Atlanta division.

CREC ascribes to a strict version of Reformed theology — rooted in the tradition of 16th-century Protestant reformer John Calvin — that puts a heavy emphasis on an all-powerful God who has dominion over all of society. Wilson and CREC are also strongly influenced by a 20th-century Reformed movement called Christian Reconstructionism, according to Julie Ingersoll, a religion professor at the University of North Florida who wrote about it in her 2015 book “Building God’s Kingdom.” WATCH: Bondi launches taskforce on ‘anti-Christian policies’ in government and regulations She sees that theology reflected in the Wilson slogan Hegseth repeated on social media. The ministry has a robust media presence, including Canon Press, publisher of books like “The Case for Christian Nationalism” and “It’s Good to Be a Man: A Handbook for Godly Masculinity.” What is the connection to Christian nationalism? Among them are evangelicals who view Trump, a Republican, as a champion, some of whom are influenced by Christian Reconstructionist ideas; a charismatic movement that sees politics as part of a larger spiritual war; and a Catholic postliberal movement envisioning a muscular government promoting traditional morality.

Article: While Trump's memorandum said the mobilization would end once he determines that the "conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia," the troops were notified they would be deployed until Sept. “Currently, the National Guard is being deployed to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence," a White House official said Monday. Standing alongside Trump as he announced his executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that people should expect to see the guardsmen "flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week" and that they were prepared to bring in other specialized units. Trump's memorandum also directed Hegseth to coordinate with governors across the country and "authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission." In an interview with NBC News, Greggory Pemberton, chairman of the D.C. Pemberton said one of the main reasons local law enforcement "can't get a handle on the crime" is because of a staffing shortage of more than 800 officer vacancies and because of laws the city council enacted "that really prevent us from being able to do our job and being able to hold criminals accountable." "As a short-term, stop-gap measure, if they want to give us 1,000 National Guardsmen and 500 federal agents to help us do our job, we’ll take it," he said. "We’ll take anything we can to try to keep these criminals from victimizing citizens." Pemberton said he is concerned that if longer-term changes aren't made, once federal agents and National Guard troops leave D.C., the Metropolitan Police Department "will be left holding the bag, which will only allow crime to again, you know, regain its foothold and start growing it again." The reactions from Washingtonians to Trump's moves to take over the city were mixed. neighborhood near where guardsmen are mobilizing, told NBC News Tuesday that she agrees with Trump that the city has a crime problem, but she also doubted a short-term surge in law enforcement and the military presence would provide a sufficient fix. Attorney’s Office need to do more to prosecute those who commit crimes and hand down swift punishments that will serve as a deterrent — including holding young people, who she said are a major part of the problem, accountable. Violent crime in the district has decreased by 26% over the last year, according to Metropolitan Police Department statistics, though crime overall has gone down by only 7% during that same period. We haven’t taken our foot off the gas, and we continue to look for ways to make our city safer." Bowser met Tuesday with Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is overseeing the effort, and several other top Justice Department officials. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Bowser said Trump’s takeover of the police department will not change the force's organizational chart or “how we do business.” She emphasized that the city wanted to ensure it was using the new resources, saying she was focused on “the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.” “How we got here, or what we think about the circumstances right now, we have more police, and we want to make sure we’re using them,” she said. is a made-up phony story to distract attention from [a] deteriorating economy, from the ICE raids — which horrify even people who wanted action on immigration — and of course, from the Epstein files, it’s all a game of diversion,” said Lardner, who was holding a “Resist” sign a few blocks north of the White House, where homeless people sometimes set up encampments.

Article: Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next year — which is accounting-speak for having the resources needed to sustain operations. That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida-based company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to bounce back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals since the COVID-19 pandemic.

In neighboring Iraq, Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir discussed with Iraqi counterpart Hayan abdel-Ghani the possibility of reactivating an oil pipeline between the oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and Syria’s coastal town of Baniyas, which is home to one of the country’s two oil refineries. Before the war broke out in 2011, the oil sector was a pillar of Syria’s economy, with the country producing about 380,000 barrels a day, and exports — mostly to Europe — bringing in more than $3 billion in 2010.

Met Police The Met said uninsured driving was often linked to broader criminal activity Luxury vehicles seized included Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bentleys that were either unroadworthy or being driven illegally. One of the two drivers had been in the country for two hours and had been driving for 15 minutes before the car was seized, the Motor Insurers' Bureau said. Several of the seized vehicles had been brought to the UK from abroad, with drivers using motor insurance from their home countries without verifying whether the policy provided coverage in the UK, the organisation added. Andy Trotter, from the Motor Insurers' Bureau said: "Someone is hit by an uninsured driver every 20 minutes in the UK, someone is seriously injured by an uninsured driver every day and one person will lose their lives to an uninsured driver every week." Met Police Police seized 72 vehicles across the three day operation One driver who was stopped by police officers told BBC London: "Apparently the car came up without insurance on this registration. "On DVLA it wasn't automatically swapped from the original reg number to the personalised one, and my mistake was not to call the insurance and declare the new reg with them." Special Chief Officer James Deller, from the Met's Special Constabulary, said the operation was in response to concerns from residents and businesses that high-value vehicles were "causing a nuisance" in central and west London. Seven men and one woman were arrested during the operation: A 22-year-old man who was arrested for ABH and criminal damage A 25-year-old man, who was later charged for possession of a Class B drug A 27-year-old man was arrested for theft of a motor vehicle and released under investigation A 23-year-old man was arrested for theft of motor vehicle, dangerous driving, failing to stop for police, no insurance, no driving licence and drug driving Three men, aged 26, 35 and 39, and a 23-year-old woman, were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences.

Article: Sponsor Message Nonetheless, Trump is authorized to deploy the National Guard and assume emergency control over the MPD under home rule, the form of limited self-governance that Congress granted D.C. A major change happened in 1871, when Congress consolidated multiple local jurisdictions into a single government with a typical territorial structure: a governor appointed by the president, an elected delegate in Congress and a two-chamber legislative assembly. "As that was happening there was a lot of pushback against Black governance and rising Black political participation." In 1874, a wary Congress implemented a new form of governance in D.C: a three-member, presidentially appointed commission. "The committees were sort of notoriously stacked with southern segregationists, so you had quite an antipathy for people who actually lived in the city, especially as the city became increasingly Black" starting in the 1940s, she says. George Derek Musgrove, an associate history professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the co-author of Chocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital, says residents were fed up with being governed by lawmakers from other parts of the country who didn't align with their interests. "And it's run by some of the most retrograde members of Congress in the entire institution." Advocates' efforts paid off: Congress voted to pass the Home Rule Act in 1973. Musgrove says the Cold War was also a factor: "The lack of democracy in the capital of the United States had become a tremendous embarrassment." While Congress was eager to offload some of the logistical responsibilities of running a city, he says, it was apprehensive about the prospect of a majority-Black local government and wanted to make sure the federal government could "serve as a backstop against anything in the city that they might find uncomfortable." That's why Congress left itself the power to overturn local legislation and dictate how D.C.

By 1995, D.C.'s deficit had grown to $722 million and Wall Street dropped its bond ratings to "junk" levels, leaving the city unable to pay its vendors or obtain a line of credit. Sponsor Message Then-Mayor Marion Barry — who served from 1979 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999 — recognized the level of financial disarray and asked the federal government to step in, says Shoenfeld. In 1995, Congress created a body called the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, known as the Control Board (other cities, like New York and Chicago, had their own during periods of financial instability). "The level of control that the Control Board insisted on exercising was not what [Barry] wanted and it sort of ended up being like a hostile takeover, ultimately, where they insisted on appointing the heads of every local agency," Shoenfeld says. It very much felt like an affront to the people of the city." The Control Board took controversial actions like abolishing the city's lottery board, firing the superintendent of schools, replacing the elected Board of Education with appointed trustees and firing hundreds of government workers. regain its financial footing, and by fiscal year 2001 it had balanced five consecutive budgets — allowing the Control Board to dissolve a year earlier than initially planned, according to a Brookings Institution history.

The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan as a proposed class action, said that the police had subjected protesters to false arrest and used excessive force, violating First Amendment rights and retaliating against people who had exercised those rights. Members of the Police Department, the lawsuit said, had engaged in behavior that included “trapping protesters into spaces where they could not escape, beating protesters with batons and fists, throwing protesters to the ground, using pepper spray indiscriminately and ultimately arresting many of the protesters without lawful justification and without fair warning.”

(Philippine Coast Guard via AP) MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine military on Tuesday blamed China for the collision of two Chinese navy and coast guard ships while trying to drive the Philippine coast guard and fishermen from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. The United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines, on Tuesday condemned the “latest reckless action by China directed against a Philippine vessel.” The Chinese coast guard on Monday blamed Philippine vessels for the confrontation and said it was forced to expel the vessels after they intruded into “China’s inherent territory,” despite warnings. Video footage made public by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese navy ship with the bow number 164 slamming into the bow of a Chinese coast guard ship while both try to block and force a Philippine patrol ship, the BRP Suluan, away from Scarborough. BRP Suluan offered medical help by two-way radio to the Chinese coast guard, fearing the collision may have caused injuries to its personnel, but the Philippine coast guard said it received no response. Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese coast guard in Beijing, said Monday that the Philippine vessels intruded into Chinese territorial waters off the shoal, prompting its forces to take “necessary measures, including monitoring, forcing, intercepting and controlling the Philippine vessels to expel them.” The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told reporters in Manila that the video footage clearly showed that the Chinese navy ship maneuvered to ram the BRP Suluan, which had to move to avoid being hit. “We’ll discuss possible steps and our future tactics to counter China’s actions to stop us from getting access (to Scarborough)." Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Brawner’s statement but Gan Yu insisted its forces would be “resolutely safeguarding China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.” ___ Associated Press journalist Huizhong Wu contributed to this report.

(Jung Yeon-je/Pool Photo via AP) South Korea's former first lady Kim Keon Hee, wife of impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, arrives at a court to attend a hearing to review her arrest warrant requested by special prosecutors, in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Aug. (Jung Yeon-je/Pool Photo via AP) SEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate. The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. The investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest. Kim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week’s questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as “someone insignificant.” Investigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company. Min’s investigation team arrested one of Kim’s close associates earlier Tuesday following his arrival from Vietnam, as they look into suspicions that he used his connection to the former first lady to secure millions of dollars in business investments for his financially struggling company. The investigators also raided a construction company on Monday over allegations that its chairman purchased a luxury necklace reportedly worth $43,000, which they believe was the same one Kim wore while accompanying Yoon on a 2022 trip to Europe. Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month following a March release and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, has repeatedly resisted investigators’ attempts to compel him to answer questions about his wife.

Article: Nvidia's market capitalization — its stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding — ended Monday at roughly $4.5 trillion, equal to about 8% of the S & P 500. That's the "biggest weight in the S & P 500 of any individual stock," in data going back to 1981 , according to Apollo Global Management's chief economist, Torsten Slok. Nearly nine out of every 10 analysts who cover Jensen Huang's company on Wall Street rate it a buy, and Nvidia now sells for 59 times its trailing 12-month earnings, according to FactSet data. "There's a reason the stock is up here, which is Nvidia continues to provide most of the most critical equipment for AI and the demand for AI usage," said D.A. "So, inferencing continues to rise as the models become ever so potent." NVDA 3M mountain NVDA, 3-month But there are two areas that could go wrong for Nvidia, according to Luria, who rates Nvidia a neutral and whose $135 price target implies that the stock will slide about 26% over the next year. It's safe to assume that a lot of their other sales are indirectly to China, either to Chinese companies domiciled otherwise, or sales to resellers that ultimately arrive in China. Wells Fargo said Nvidia can grow more than 20% as a result of the agreement, which Luria described as uncertain at the same time as it "probably bodes well for their ability to sell the B30 [chips] either later this year or at some point next year. "What most of their big customers are now talking about is that the chips aren't the bottleneck – it's the ability to have a data center on the power grid with HVAC equipment ready for chips that's holding them back," Luria added. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, told CNBC that, as the market leader, Nvidia may eventually face another challenge as a result of the AI boom: increasing competition. For instance, Amazon Web Services has been making efforts to rival Nvidia when it comes to AI infrastructure , saying earlier this year that it's looking to reduce training costs associated with AI and provide an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. "While they are riding an incredible and massive CapEx spending wave on the GenAI model [and] data center buildout, selling semis is still a very competitive and cyclical business," Boockvar said.

Damascus said the sides had agreed to form a working group “to support the Syrian government’s efforts to consolidate the ceasefire in [Suwayda] province, and work to find a comprehensive solution to the crisis”. His Majesty King Abdullah II, in a meeting with US Special Envoy for Syria and Ambassador to Türkiye Thomas Barrack attended by HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein, noted Washington’s key role in supporting Syria’s reconstruction in a way that preserves the rights of all Syrians #Jordan pic.twitter.com/QrtI0eybiQ — RHC (@RHCJO) August 12, 2025 The Jordanian-Syrian-American meeting was a continuation of discussions held between the officials in Amman on July 19 about deadly clashes in the Druze-majority Syrian province of Suwayda, where a week of sectarian violence killed 1,400 people before a ceasefire put an end to the bloodshed. Advertisement Syria’s minority communities have expressed concerns for their safety since December, when a lightning rebel offensive toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, who had projected himself as a protector of minority groups. While the new Syrian authorities have repeatedly stated their intent to protect all of the country’s ethnic and religious groups, the killing of more than 1,700 mostly Alawite civilians along the coast in March and the violence in Suwayda have brought the issue of sectarian tensions to the fore. Jordan expresses support for Syria’s reconstruction efforts Following Tuesday’s meeting, Syria, the US and Jordan released a joint statement regarding Suwayda, saying that it is “an integral part of the Syrian Arab Republic, and that the rights of its people are protected and preserved in the process of rebuilding the new Syria toward a secure and accomplished future for all citizens of the Syrian state, ensuring their representation and participation in building Syria’s future.” Jordan’s King Abdullah II separately met with al-Shaibani and Barrack, expressing his “support for Syria’s efforts to preserve its security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity”, said a statement from the Jordanian government. The king also said Jordan was ready “to share its expertise in all fields to help develop and strengthen the capabilities of Syrian institutions” and “noted the need to step up Jordanian-Syrian cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and preventing arms and drug smuggling”, the statement added. According to the Syrian statement, the foreign ministers’ meeting welcomed Damascus’s efforts to “restore basic services, hold perpetrators of violations to account, and prepare the conditions for the return of displaced people to their homes”. Syria’s new authorities have worked to attract investment for the reconstruction of infrastructure across the country after the United States and European Union lifted sanctions on Syria in the wake of al-Assad’s ouster. Damascus signed 12 agreements worth $14bn last week, including a $4bn agreement with Qatar’s UCC Holding to build a new airport and a $2bn deal to establish a subway in Damascus with the national investment corporation of the United Arab Emirates. Other major developments on the investment front include the $2bn Damascus Towers project for residential high-rises, signed with the Italian-based company UBAKO; a $500m deal for the Baramkeh Towers project, also in Damascus; and another $60m agreement for Baramkeh Mall.

Article: Ukraine’s military has sent reserves to stem Russian advances near two key cities in the eastern Donetsk region, as Moscow attempts to gain more territory before a meeting between its leader, Vladimir Putin and United States President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, where land swap issues to end the war will be focal. The Ukrainian General Staff said on Tuesday that its forces were involved in “difficult” fighting close to Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, with the extra soldiers needed to block attacks by small groups of Russian troops. The development suggests intensifying struggles in the eastern Donetsk area, where Moscow-backed separatists have mainly held sway since the conflict there erupted there 2014, instigated by the Kremlin and deepened by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s advance is one of the most dramatic in the past year, with its soldiers infiltrating 17km (10 miles) past Ukrainian lines over the last three days, according to Pasi Paroinen, a military analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group. Moscow, which has further isolated the destroyed town of Kostiantynivka, one of the last remaining urban areas Ukraine holds in the Donetsk, hopes to encircle the nearby city of Pokrovsk. Ukraine’s DeepState blog, which has close connections to the Ukrainian military, described the situation as “quite chaotic”, as Russian troops are “infiltrating deeper, trying to quickly consolidate and accumulate forces for further advancement”. In the run-up to the talks, the EU said on Tuesday that it welcomed the US president’s efforts “towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, but emphasised that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and “international borders must not be changed by force.” Trump had earlier disappointed his European allies by saying that Ukraine and Russia would have to accept land swaps if peace is to be achieved.

Article: The two have clashed over interest rates: Trump has pushed for aggressive cuts, while Powell has maintained the bank will make a decision based on financial indicators, not political pressure. “I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.” The president’s attacks on Powell have become a source of concern for economic observers, who worry that Trump is attempting to undermine the independence of the central bank and bring it into closer alignment with his political priorities. The Federal Reserve is currently undergoing renovations on two of its historic buildings, both built in the 1930s, including asbestos removal, major structural work to meet modern safety standards, and the replacement of antiquated systems for ventilation, plumbing, electricity and fire detection. Advertisement “While periodic work has been done to keep these buildings occupiable, neither building has seen a comprehensive renovation since they were first constructed,” Powell wrote in a letter to the Trump administration on July 17. “Both buildings were in need of significant structural repairs and other updates to make the buildings safe, healthy, and effective places to work.” But while the renovation project was initially estimated to cost $1.9bn, that number has increased to around $2.5bn as construction proceeds. “Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board.” Powell and economic policymakers at the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, have expressed concern over Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, which they maintain could increase inflation in the coming months.

Article: China has announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports, a new escalation in the yearlong trade dispute that began with Ottawa’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports last August. China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday that an anti-dumping probe launched in September 2024 had found that Canada’s agricultural sector – particularly the canola industry – had benefitted from “substantial” government subsidies and preferential policies. Advertisement The decision marks a shift from the conciliatory tone struck in June when China Premier Li Qiang said there were no deep-seated conflicts of interest between the countries during a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The move provides an opportunity for Australia, which looks set to regain access to the Chinese market with a few test cargoes this year after a years-long freeze in the trade, Pay said. Australia, the second-largest canola exporter, has been shut out of the Chinese market since 2020 due mainly to Chinese rules to stop the spread of fungal plant disease called “blackleg”. However, even if Australian imports increase, “fully replacing Canadian canola will be very difficult unless import demand drops sharply,” said Donatas Jankauskas, an analyst with commodity data firm CM Navigator. “This is a gut punch no one was expecting.” Ventum Financial broker David Derwin said some traders do not know how to take the Chinese move yet, since it is not a final rule.

Article: WASHINGTON — Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by President Donald Trump began arriving in the nation's capital on Tuesday, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city's police department and reduce crime in what the president called — without substantiation — a lawless city. Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged to work alongside the federal officials Trump has tasked with overseeing the city's law enforcement, while insisting the police chief remained in charge of the department and its officers. The tone was a shift the day before, when Bowser said Trump's plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and call in the National Guard was not a productive step and argued his perceived state of emergency simply doesn’t match the declining crime numbers. city government" to “make Washington, D.C., safe again." The city and Trump have had a bumpy relationship While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we're going to take our capital back,” Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in summer 2020. In Trump's second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasizing common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the NFL's Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington's youth curfew, Chapman said Trump's latest move “is not about creating a safer D.C. It's just about power.” Where the power actually lies Bowser contends that all the power resides with Trump and that her administration can do little other than comply and make the best of it. "That is why you have heard me, and many many Washingtonians before me, advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia.” Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to take over Washington’s police for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. “That should alarm everyone,” she said, “not just in Washington.” For Trump, the effort to take over public safety in Washington reflects an escalation of his aggressive approach to law enforcement. The District of Columbia’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. is ending and ending today.” The action fits a presidential pattern Trump's declaration of a state of emergency fits the general pattern of his second term in office: He has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs, enabling him to essentially rule via executive order. “We are proving that strong enforcement, and smart policies can make our communities safer." In May, Trump abandoned his efforts to get Martin confirmed for the post in the face of opposition in Congress. On Monday, Pirro — standing next to Trump — called his takeover “the step that we need right now to make criminals understand that they are not going to get away with it anymore." ___ Associated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.

Article: No printers or PCs, Starbucks Korea tells customers 1 hour ago Share Save Faarea Masud BBC Business reporter Share Save Getty Images Starbucks customers in South Korea have been asked to stop bringing "bulky items" into cafes to do their office work, after some brought printers and desktop computers. As many people choose to work from home, cafes like Starbucks have been trying to strike the balance between being a casual coffee place and welcoming customers choosing to work there. "If you can't afford an office space and Starbucks is silly enough to let you run your office there for the price of their less-than-mediocre sugary caffeine beverage, go for it," said one user on Reddit. "Starbucks remains committed to being a welcoming third place for coffee and connection, and where community thrives in every cup, every conversation, and every visit", Starbucks concluded, though its mild-mannered response hides the derision many feel for those seen to be hogging seats at cafes. Starbucks's in South Korea move echoes sentiment in cafes across the world, including in England where some coffee shops have introduced policies aimed at stopping remote workers from "hogging" tables and limiting turnover.

Article: British soldiers using sex workers in Kenya despite ban, inquiry finds It was commissioned in October 2024 following an investigation by ITV into the behaviour of soldiers at Batuk, including allegations some army personnel were paying local women for sex. Soldiers at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) used sex workers "at a low or moderate" level, a report said, adding more work was needed to stamp out the practice. The ITV documentary followed previous concerns raised about Batuk after the death in 2012 of a local woman Agnes Wanjiru, allegedly killed by a British soldier stationed at the base. Since then a string of allegations have been made about the conduct of troops at the training site, which lies near the town of Nanyuki 200km (125 miles) north of Kenya's capital Nairobi. It notes that of those, 26 cases happened before training on the new rule was initiated for all army staff in November of that year, with nine reported cases since then. In addition to those detailed in the report, the Foreign Office told the BBC there was a small number - less than five - cases of alleged use of sex workers currently under investigation. The report said that despite the training given by the Army and the control measures in place, the reality was that "transactional sexual activity" by UK personnel in Kenya was still happening, and that "the level is somewhere between low and moderate". "It is not out of control, but the best way for the Army to manage the risk is for the Army to assume it may be at the upper end of that scale between low and moderate," the report added. The report noted efforts by the Army to stamp out the practice, including regular training and the use of "sharkwatch" patrols with a senior officer of Sargeant rank or above deployed to monitor the conduct of junior personnel when they left the base for nights out. The report follows years of controversy about the conduct of soldiers at Batuk sparked by an investigation by the Sunday Times in 2021 which revealed the alleged involvement of a British soldier in the murder of Ms Wanjiru, a mother of one whose body was found dumped in a septic tank near a hotel where she had been seen with soldiers on the night she vanished. Separately in Kenya, MPs have been conducting an inquiry into wider allegations of mistreatment of local people by soldiers at Batuk and have heard claims at public hearings of injuries allegedly sustained through the behaviour of British troops and of soldiers fathering children to Kenyan mothers and then abandoning them when they returned home. The Service Inquiry behind the latest report said it had spoken to many local Kenyans and found "the vast majority" of local residents were happy with the presence of the Batuk camp.

Article: Israel’s targeted killing of an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza over the weekend was noteworthy even for a conflict remarkably blood-soaked for journalists, leaving some experts to marvel that any news at all emerges from the territory. An Al Jazeera executive said Monday that it won’t back down from covering what is going on there and called for news organizations to step up and recruit more journalists. A total of 184 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israel in the Gaza war since its start in October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 7 AP dispatch vividly described the hunger faced by many in Gaza: “A single bowl of eggplant stewed in watery tomato juice must sustain Sally Muzhed’s family of six for the day. She calls it moussaka, but it’s a pale echo of the fragrant, lawyered, meat-and-vegetable dish that once filled Gaza’s kitchens with its aroma.” Other recent AP reports carried images and text reporting from the aftermath of an Israeli strike on Gaza’s only Catholic church, and a profile of an 18-year-old aspiring doctor now trying to survive sheltered in a tent. WATCH: Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Sharif and 4 other journalists killed by Israeli drone strike in Gaza Journalists from The Washington Post and the Guardian recently accompanied a Jordanian relief mission and took images of Gaza from the air, despite some restrictions from Israel. The Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo wrote: “Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient civilization, brought to light after centuries of darkness.” None of the organizations match the power and immediacy of Al Jazeera, however, in part because their correspondents have been in front of cameras. They’ve also paid the heaviest price: CPJ estimates that 11 journalists and media workers affiliated with AJ have been killed in the Gaza conflict, more than any other single organization. In a social media post written in June to be sent if he was killed, al-Sharif wrote that “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent.” In another posting on X on Aug. When I told you on air that it was an ‘indescribable scene,’ I was truly helpless in the face of this horrific sight.” Al Jazeera calls for other news organizations to come forward Salah Negm, news director at Al Jazeera English, said Monday it is very difficult to get people in to Gaza. “A lot of people in Gaza talk to us.” Many of the journalists working in Gaza are facing the same struggles to find food, for themselves and their families, as the people they are covering. Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said she’s concerned about the implications for journalists in future conflicts if what is happening in Gaza is allowed to continue without international condemnation that has real teeth. “They’re essentially admitting in public to what amounts to a war crime,” Ginsberg said, “and they can do that because none of the other attacks on journalists have had any consequences. It’s not surprising that it can act with this level of impunity because no international government has really taken it to task.” Given all that they face, “to me, the most remarkable thing is that journalists are continuing to cover (Gaza) at all,” she said.

Article: Zelenskyy said over the weekend that Kyiv “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done,” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” The remarks came after Trump said a peace deal would involve swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides “to the betterment of both.” For Zelenskyy, such a deal would be disaster for his presidency and spark public outcry after more than three years of bloodshed and sacrifice by Ukrainians. A look at the challenges such proposals entail: Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukraine, from the country’s northeast to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed illegally in 2014. The front line is vast and cuts across six regions — the active front stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers (680 miles) — but if measured from along the border with Russia, it reaches as far as 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles). READ MORE: Trump suggests he’ll know if Putin wants a peace deal with Ukraine soon into their meeting Russia also partially controls more than half of the Kherson region, which is critical to maintain logistical flows of supplies coming in from the land corridor in neighboring Crimea, and also parts of the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Kremlin seized Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian forces are still active in the Kursk region inside Russia, but they barely hold any territory there, making it not as potent a bargaining chip as Kyiv’s leaders had probably hoped when they launched the daring incursion across the border last year. From a military standpoint, abandoning the Donetsk region in particular would vastly improve Russia’s ability to invade Ukraine again, according to the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War. Bowing to such a demand would force Ukraine to abandon its “fortress belt,” the main defensive line in Donetsk since 2014, “with no guarantee that fighting will not resume,” the institute said in a recent report. Ukraine’s constitution poses a major challenge to any deal involving a land swap because it requires a nationwide referendum to approve changes to the country’s territorial borders, said Ihor Reiterovych, a politics professor in the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. “In the constitution it is written that only by referendum can changes to Ukraine’s territory be conducted.” If during negotiations Zelenskyy agrees to swap territory with Russia, “in the same minute he will be a criminal because he would be abandoning the main law that governs Ukraine,” Reiterovych said. Trump said he was “a little bothered” by Zelenskyy’s assertion over the weekend that he needed constitutional approval to cede to Russia the territory that it captured in its unprovoked invasion. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.” Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., brought a copy of her country’s constitution to her interview on Sunday with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and described how the president is “the guarantor of the constitution” and cannot give away land under Article 133. Along with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the partial occupation of Luhansk and Donetsk after that, it would require accepting that the Ukrainian military is not able to retake lost territories militarily.

Article: The United States Department of Justice has accused George Washington University of deliberate indifference to anti-Semitism, making the Washington, DC-based institution the latest to find itself in the crosshairs of the administration of President Donald Trump. “The Division finds that GWU took no meaningful action and was instead deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its Jewish and Israeli students and faculty,” the statement says. In a letter to the university, the Justice Department accused GWU of being “deliberately indifferent” to complaints it received from students and faculty, saying they failed to prevent or remedy abuses despite knowing of them. Dozens of universities may face investigation The Justice Department notice comes as the Trump administration has intensified pressure on institutions of higher education over allegations that they have allowed anti-Semitism to fester, particularly as pro-Palestinian protests and encampments spread across US university campuses in 2023 and 2024. In February, the Justice Department launched a federal task force to investigate allegations of anti-Semitism at 10 university campuses: Columbia University; George Washington University; Harvard University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.

Article: The consumer price index report (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over this time last year and follows a 2.7 percent increase in June, according to the Department of Labor report released on Tuesday. Increases and decreases “Today’s CPI report revealed that inflation beat market expectations once again and remains stable, underscoring President [Donald] Trump’s commitment to lower costs for American families and businesses,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to reporters. “We really are seeing a divergence in the inflation data right now between import-sensitive sectors and those that do not rely on imports,” Daniel Hornung, senior fellow at MIT and former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement Compared with this time last year, hotel prices fell by 1.3 percent and car rental prices tumbled by 2.9 percent as Americans have pulled back on discretionary travel spending. But products like tools and hardware prices ticked up 1.6 percent, car parts rose by 0.9 percent, and footwear surged 1.4 percent, all items that are imported and have to bear the levies. The latest data comes after Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, amid recently revised jobs data showing far fewer jobs were created than originally reported. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, but he has since appointed authors of many of its chapters to several key roles in the federal government, including Brenden Carr, who now leads the Federal Communications Commission and Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget. “It might last even longer because of the way that the tariffs are being put in place, where we’re seeing in April one set of tariff announcements that take a few months to work their way through into consumer prices. Then again, in August, another set of increased incremental tariff rates that will work their way through the system over the course of the fall.” In the private sector, some of the US’s largest businesses have announced a need to raise prices because of tariffs, including big box retailer Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker.

Article: Sherrod Brown has decided to run for the Senate next year in Ohio, according to three sources familiar with his plans, potentially putting the Republican-leaning state in play for Democrats. But a midterm year is typically tougher for the president's party, and Democrats have been aggressively recruiting Brown to run in the special election to serve the remainder of Vice President JD Vance’s Senate term against Sen. Democrats have two ripe targets in North Carolina and Maine, but they would then have to flip two GOP-held seats in states Trump won by double digits last year to take control of the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has traveled to Ohio twice in recent months, the latest visit coming in late June, a source familiar with the meeting, first reported by Axios, confirmed to NBC News. Brown's ability to overperform the national environment in a state that's been broadly trending away from Democrats is one reason they've been so bullish in trying to lure him into the race. Tyson Shepard, a spokesman for Husted’s campaign, said in a statement to NBC news: "Should Brown enter the race as Schumer’s handpicked candidate he will be starting in the biggest hole of his political career. Brown’s slogans will ring hollow as his coalition walks away, tired of the radical policies he’s forced to support to appease his coastal bosses in California and New York.” Brown, who had also been weighing a run for governor in Ohio, has been working to reorient his party, which, in his view, has lost its way among working-class voters. “But I lost in large part because the national reputation of the Democratic Party is that we are sort of a lighter version of a corporation — a corporate party. … It’s a good example of how workers get screwed.” A Senate run by Brown would also provide some clarity for Ohio Democrats as they look to fill out the rest of their statewide slate. Amy Acton, a Brown ally who has been running for governor for months, could ramp up her campaign without the nagging speculation that the former senator might enter the race and push her to the sidelines. Young Democratic mayors like Justin Bibb in Cleveland and Aftab Pureval in Cincinnati could concentrate fully on their uncomplicated 2025 re-election bids, free from the pressure to step up to a Senate race next year, though they could be courted for down-ballot contests.

Article: The Emil Bove-led effort failed to dismiss Adams’ corruption case in a way that would’ve let the administration hold the threat of reviving the prosecution over New York City’s mayor as political leverage. President Donald Trump subsequently appointed the Trump personal defense lawyer–turned–Trump DOJ lawyer to the federal bench, despite his unresolved ethical issues — so perhaps Bove sees the Adams case as a success, or at least benign.) More recently, another judge said “no” to the DOJ’s preferred ending to another criminal case, this one against Trevor Kirk in California. Kirk was a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who was found guilty by a federal jury in February of using excessive force when he assaulted and pepper-sprayed a woman outside a supermarket in 2023. According to DOJ’s news release in connection with the guilty verdict, while he was on top of the victim, Kirk used his police radio “to give a misleading report that he was in a ‘fight.’” But then, the Trump administration installed a new U.S. The office under Essayli moved to delay Kirk’s sentencing so the new top prosecutor could “review the facts and circumstances of this case.” The office then moved to reduce Kirk’s case from a felony to a misdemeanor and proposed a post-trial plea agreement that, if judicially approved, would give him probation. Essayli’s office then moved to fully dismiss the case — over objection of the victim, who observed that the government was “attempting to deploy a motion to dismiss to effectively overturn this Court’s prison sentence.” She said that “if the Government’s unprecedented maneuver works here, it will no doubt serve as a roadmap for other cases.” Wilson declined to allow the gambit. “Instead,” he went on, “the record shows that the Government brings this motion to overrule the Court’s sentencing decision.” The judge’s rebuke might not be the final twist in the story. On top of whatever happens on appeal, Wilson raised another prospect that’s all too real in the Trump era, where clemency is a routine part of the criminal justice process — or a way around it. In a footnote on the final page of his order, the judge wrote that his denial “does not leave the Government without options if it truly believes Defendant should not serve prison time. That power is ‘unlimited’ and, unlike Rule 48(a) [the procedural rule governing dismissals], is not subject to judicial review for whether it is contrary to the public interest.” With a prison surrender date set for later this month, we could soon learn whether Trump will exercise his pardon power or, if he doesn’t feel like sending a message of full vindication but wants to keep the lawman out of prison, commute Kirk’s sentence.

Article: “But now, due to the occupation forces, I hardly go out at all.” The family has lived in this yellow-plastered house for 40 years – longer than Azem has been alive. Unemployment soared over 30 percent, leaving Azem and his two brothers without regular work, and the family now relying solely on the income of Azem’s father, Wael, a taxi driver. Azem says the soldiers tried to frame him as an armed fighter, yelling questions at him like: “Why are you attacking us with Molotov cocktails?” The questions didn’t make sense to Azem, who says he has never engaged in violence. He says the soldiers then pushed him face-first into the ground, and one of them stepped on his head and asked: “Do you love Iran?” Azem said no, that he wasn’t political and that he doesn’t support Iran. “The video mocks us, the people of Palestine.” Though he took the video down quickly, others saw it, including Sebastia’s Mayor Mohammed Azem (no relation), who saved a copy as evidence of the soldiers’ mistreatment. Maha, Azem’s mother, speaks up: “When the Israeli soldier learned he was from Sebastia, they wanted to make this video to send a message to all of Sebastia, to say: ‘I’m here, and I control your village, and I do what I want to do here.’” “If he hadn’t said [what they commanded him to say], they could have hurt him worse, or killed him,” she adds. In the West Bank, soldiers near Hebron have allegedly drawn the Star of David on a Palestinian child’s book and branded the symbol on a man’s face in occupied East Jerusalem. “Israel employs a systematic strategy of humiliation to psychologically impact and break down Palestinian individuals and communities,” writes Ramy Abdu, chairman of the Swiss nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, comparing such acts of humiliation to those witnessed during World War II’s Kristallnacht. Increasingly, and especially since 2019, Jewish settlers have “attempted to impose a separation between the acropolis of the ancient site of Sebastia … and the village”, according to a report from Emek Shaveh, an Israeli archaeological NGO. Last month, it released a paper addressed to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, stating: “Israel’s attempt to appropriate the acropolis and sever it from the town undermines the historical integrity of the site … and violates the cultural rights of the town residents.” In response to Emek Shaveh’s objections, the Israeli military confirmed last year that establishing a military facility at the summit of the Sebastia archaeological site would involve frequent military incursions through the Palestinian town below. “The municipal employees, when they’re working in the street, they attack them.” There is no presence of Palestinian resistance fighters in Sebastia, and locals don’t have weapons to defend themselves, the mayor says. “When they pushed and attacked the girls, the Red Crescent came and took them to the hospital,” because locals can’t use their own cars for transportation to the hospital, for fear of Israeli military violence. These incursions and the intended bifurcation of the village are happening even though Israel is signatory to the First Protocol of the Hague Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from retaining cultural property in an occupied territory. Advertisement But Mayor Azem believes UNESCO has been slow to move forward partly because it doesn’t want to agitate the administration of US President Donald Trump, which has already put UNESCO participation under review due to so-called “anti-Israel sentiment”.

Article: A man who opened fire at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) apparently wanted to send a message against the COVID vaccines, according to authorities in the United States. Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said that documents found at White’s home “expressed the shooter’s discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations” and that he wanted to make “the public aware of his discontent with the vaccine”. “This tragedy was not random and it compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured,” a union representing CDC employees, AFGE Local 2883, said in a statement on Monday. He also downplayed the pandemic’s risks, saying in February 2020: “I think it’s going to work out fine.” Since January, in the opening months of his second term, critics have accused Trump of continuing to sow doubt in vaccination and medical research. Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off CDC employees, said Kennedy was responsible for villainising the CDC’s workforce through “his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust”.

Article: John Cornyn, is in the middle of the debate as one of the Democrats who are holed up in Illinois to deny Republicans the chance to move forward with a plan to net their party up to five more House seats in Washington. Democrats are hopeful that the energy around the redistricting fight, as well as fallout from the Cornyn-Paxton battle, could help them put the Senate race in the traditionally red state on the map. Matt Angle, a longtime Democratic strategist in Texas who runs the Lone Star Project, told NBC News that the redistricting battle has fired up the party’s “activist” base in the state. Talarico is a fresh face and he’s interesting, and Colin also shows a resoluteness and a competence that really plays to his strength." While O’Rourke and Talarico haven’t jumped into the race, their political operations have massively increased their digital spending on Meta platforms in recent days. O’Rourke — who previously ran for Senate and governor in Texas, as well as for president — has spent $380,000 since the state House Democrats announced their quorum break on Aug. There have only been five days within the past six years where O’Rourke has spent more than that $98,000 on Meta platforms dating back to mid-2019 — all were during the summer and fall of 2022, during his campaign against Gov. O’Rourke, who has become one of the more visible Democrats in the state after three high-profile bids for office, has been blanketing the airwaves for weeks, blasting the Texas redistricting plan and calling on national Democrats to “match fire with fire.” He’s also been raising funds for the Democratic lawmakers in the hopes of offsetting the steep financial penalties and other costs they’re facing. And so he comes to our state to grab even more power in the form of these five congressional districts,” O’Rourke said at a rally over the weekend in Fort Worth, one many he’s held in recent days in Texas and around the country. Paxton filed a lawsuit aimed at booting Talarico and a dozen other state legislators from office, while Abbott’s office posted a “wanted” poster of Talarico on its social media channels. Talarico, who had already made waves this summer with a high-profile appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast and other national interviews, has become a constant presence on television and done a slew of other media appearances since the quorum break began. Barbara Jordan, as well as more recent examples such as O’Rourke — Talarico said last week during an interview on The Ringer’s “Higher Learning” podcast that Democrats in the state know how to be bold. Everyone knows the Alamo, that is part of our DNA as Texans, it’s fighting for what we believe in, for standing up for what we believe is right regardless of the consequences,” he said. Later, Talarico took a swipe at Paxton and said that while he’s looking at the Senate race, he has been more focused on the redistricting fight and will decide “once we get past this quorum break and hopefully beat these corrupt maps.” Still, taking the Senate plunge would be a major step for Talarico, who has never had to build out a statewide fundraising or organizing operation before. As a former lawyer who worked on voting rights cases and a former congressman who initially defeated a Republican incumbent on his way to office, Allred has grounded much of his pitch on his own expertise. He has blasted Republicans for their comments that the redistricting plan is solely about accumulating more power in Washington and testifying against the plan in front of the state House. As Allred continues his run and Democrats wait to see what O’Rourke and Talarico decide, Angle lamented that his party may only get the chance to vote for one of these candidates in the general election.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has taken control of D.C.’s law enforcement and ordered National Guard troops to deploy onto the streets of the nation’s capital, arguing the extraordinary moves are necessary to curb an urgent public safety crisis. Even as district officials questioned the claims underlying his emergency declaration, the Republican president promised a “historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” His rhetoric echoed that used by conservatives going back decades who have denounced cities, especially those with majority non-white populations or led by progressives, as lawless or crime-ridden and in need of outside intervention. To some, it echoes uncomfortable historical chapters when politicians used language to paint historically or predominantly Black cities and neighborhoods with racist narratives to shape public opinion and justify aggressive police action. “But as far as (him) trying to get (the) homeless out of this city, that ain’t going to work.” “It’s like a band-aid to a gunshot wound,” said Melissa Velasquez, a commuter into D.C. “I feel like there’s been an increase of racial profiling and stuff, and so it’s concerning for individuals who are worried about how they might be perceived as they go about their day-to-day lives.” Uncertainty raises alarms According to White House officials, troops will be deployed to protect federal assets and facilitate a safe environment for law enforcement to make arrests. “The president foreshadowed that if these heavy-handed tactics take root here, they will be rolled out to other majority-Black and Brown cities, like Chicago, Oakland and Baltimore, across the country,” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s D.C. National Guard and police can lead to abuse, intimidation and civil rights violations — from military helicopters swooping over peaceful racial justice protesters in 2020 to the unchecked conduct of federal officers who remain shielded from full accountability,” Hopkins said. A history of denigrating language Conservatives have for generations used denigrating language to describe the condition of major cities and called for greater law enforcement, often in response to changing demographics in those cities driven by nonwhite populations relocating in search of work or safety from racial discrimination and state violence. President Richard Nixon won the White House in 1968 after campaigning on a “law and order” agenda to appeal to white voters in northern cities alongside overtures to white Southerners as part of his “Southern Strategy.” Ronald Reagan similarly won both his presidential elections after campaigning heavily on law and order politics. Politicians, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President Bill Clinton have cited the need to tamp down crime as a reason to seize power from liberal cities for decades. Bowser kept a mostly measured tone during a Monday news conference but decried Trump’s reasoning as a “so-called emergency,” saying residents “know that access to our democracy is tenuous.” Trump threatened to “take over” and “beautify” D.C. on the campaign trail and claimed it was “a nightmare of murder and crime.” He also argued the city was “horribly run” and said his team intended “to take it away from the mayor.” Trump on Monday repeated old comments about some of the nation’s largest cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland and his hometown of New York City. Trump’s rhetoric “paints a picture that crime is out of control, even when it is not true, then blames the policies of Democratic lawmakers that are reform- and public safety-minded, and then claims that you have to step in and violate people’s rights or demand that reforms be reversed,” Wiley said. Leaders call the order an unjustified distraction Trump’s actions in Washington and comments about other major cities sent shock waves across the country, as other leaders prepare to respond to potential federal action. Wes Moore said in a statement that Trump’s plan “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous” and pointed to a 30-year-low crime rate in Baltimore as a reason the administration should consult local leaders rather than antagonize them. In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee called Trump’s characterization of the city “fearmongering.” The administration already faced a major flashpoint between local control and federal power earlier in the summer, when Trump deployed National Guard troops to quell protests and support immigration enforcement operations in LA despite opposition from California Gov.

Article: State Department slashes its annual reports on human rights Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AP Mandel Ngan/AP The State Department released its long-awaited reports on international human rights Tuesday, and they drastically reduce the types of government repression and abuse that the United States under President Trump deems worthy of criticism. The new report on El Salvador drops references to poor prison conditions — simply saying in the executive summary, "There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses." The same blanket assurance appears in the executive summary for Hungary, and gone is extensive documentation of government corruption there. This year's release was delayed for months while the State Department spent additional time deleting thousands of violations from drafts prepared in 2024 by foreign service officers and their contacts abroad. Trump praised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is widely thought to have ordered the torture and assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying Saudi Arabia's success didn't come from western nationbuilders giving, "lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs." Sponsor Message Traditionally, the Secretary of State presents the reports in a public briefing. But ever since he was confirmed, he seems to have forgotten all that." Two-thirds of content cut from reports Earlier this year, NPR obtained an internal State Department memo instructing employees editing the reports to remove whole categories of violations not "explicitly required by statute," including gender-based violence and environmental justice. They were told to remove roughly two-thirds of the content in what officials there call an effort to conform to administration policies and make the reports "more readable." The deleted material includes issues widely regarded as fundamental rights under international law, such as the right to a fair public trial. Political gatekeeper The memo also orders that reports on 20 specific countries, including Canada, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, be flagged for review by Samuel Samson, a political appointee in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. His resume includes working at "The American Moment," a conservative political organization whose mission, according to the CEO , is to place right-wing activists in "well-paying jobs where they will have influence." Loading... "If the Trump administration's going to be undermining human rights here," he said, "they don't want to have to report on what's happening in other countries." Of note is the report on the United Kingdom. report there is extensive documentation of government restrictions censoring "hate speech." Vice President JD Vance has publicly raised the issue of infringements on expression outside abortion clinics in the U.K.

Article: Some of the 800 National Guard members deployed by US President Donald Trump have started arriving in the nation’s capital, ramping up after the White House ordered federal forces to take over the city’s police department and reduce crime in what the president called – without substantiation – a lawless city. The law lets Trump control the police department for a month, but how aggressive the federal presence will be and how it could play out remained open questions as the city’s mayor and police chief went to the Justice Department to meet with the attorney general. The meeting comes a day after Mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump’s freshly announced plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and call in the National Guard was not a productive step. “We could contest that,” she said of Trump’s definition of a crime emergency, “but his authority is pretty broad.” Bowser made a reference to Trump’s “so-called emergency” and concluded: “I’m going to work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster.” Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said Trump has accused Democrats of being “weak on crime”. Trump’s bumpy relationship with DC While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we’re going to take our capital back”, Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023. “The White House says crime may be down, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a problem and that violent crime exists at levels that are far too high,” Halkett said. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in the summer of 2020. In Trump’s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasising common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the National Football League’s (NFL’s) Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington’s youth curfew, Chapman said Trump’s latest move “is not about creating a safer DC; it’s just about power”.

Putin and Donald Trump Putin met Trump met six times during the American’s first term -– at and on the sidelines of G20 and APEC gatherings — but most famously in Helsinki in July 2018. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Since Trump returned to the White House this year, he and Putin have had about a half-dozen publicly disclosed telephone conversations. They hosted each other for talks and informal meetings in Russia and the U.S., met regularly on the sidelines of international summits and forums, and boasted of improving ties between onetime rivals. After the first meeting with Putin in 2001, Bush said he “looked the man in the eye” and “found him very straightforward and trustworthy,” getting “a sense of his soul.” In 2002, they signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty -– a nuclear arms pact that significantly reduced both countries’ strategic nuclear warhead arsenal. He has called Bush “a decent person and a good friend,” adding that good relations with him helped find a way out of “the most acute and conflict situations.” Putin and Bill Clinton Bill Clinton traveled to Moscow in June 2000, less than a month after Putin was inaugurated as president for the first time in a tenure that has stretched to the present day. At a news conference the next day, Clinton said Russia under Putin “has the chance to build prosperity and strength, while safeguarding that freedom and the rule of law.” The two also met in July of that same year at the G8 summit in Japan, in September — at the Millennium Summit at the U.N. president reportedly said it was “interesting,” and, “I think yes,” but later backtracked and said it “wasn’t possible at the moment.” Putin used the anecdote to illustrate his point about the West’s hostility toward Russia, “a big country with its own opinion.” “We just realized that they are not waiting for us there, that’s all.

Article: BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — The Malian military government on Monday started returning home the historic manuscripts of Timbuktu, which were spirited out of their fabled northern city when it was occupied by al-Qaida-linked militants more than a decade ago. Islamic radicals destroyed more than 4,000 manuscripts, some dating back to the 13th century, after they seized Timbuktu in 2012, according to the findings of a United Nations expert mission. The majority of the documents dating back to the 13th century — more than 27,000 — were saved by the devotion of the Timbuktu library’s Malian custodians, who carried them out of the occupied city in rice sacks, on donkey carts, by motorcycle, by boat and four-wheel drive vehicles. The first batch of the manuscripts were brought to Timbuktu by plane from the capital of Bamako, authorities said, adding that the return was necessary to protect them from the threats of Bamako’s humidity. WATCH: Rescuing the priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu A museum guard works around boxes which held ancient manuscripts which were partially damaged at the Ahmed Baba Institute, or Ahmed Baba Centre for Documentation and Research, in Timbuktu January 31, 2013. Photo by Benoit Tessier/REUTERSDiahara Touré, Timbuktu’s deputy mayor, said the famous documents are important to the local people as they “reflect our civilization and spiritual and intellectual heritage.” “This is the first stage” of the return, said Bilal Mahamane Traoré, a local official. He described them as as a “legacy that bears witness to the intellectual greatness and crossroads of civilization” of the city of Timbuktu — “a bridge between the past and the future.” “We now have a responsibility to protect, digitize, study, and promote these treasures so that they continue to enlighten Mali, Africa, and the world,” Kansaye said during Monday’s return ceremony.

Article: Nevada passed a similar set of restrictions on AI companies offering therapy services in June, while Utah also tightened regulations for AI use in mental health in May but stopped short of banning the use of AI. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The bans come as experts have raised alarms about the potential dangers of therapy with AI chatbots that haven’t been reviewed by regulators for safety and effectiveness. “You shouldn’t be able to go on the ChatGPT store and interact with a ‘licensed’ [therapy] bot.” But it remains to be seen how Illinois’ ban will work in practice, said Will Rinehart, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The law could be challenging to enforce, he said, depending on how authorities interpret its definition of therapy services: Will AI companies be able to comply by attaching disclaimers to their websites, or will any AI chatbot that describes itself as a therapist be subject to penalties? Advertisement Mario Treto Jr., the secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which will enforce the ban, declined to discuss specific examples but said he would look at “the letter of the law” in evaluating cases. Advertisement Advertisement Illinois’ bill says AI companies cannot provide or advertise “services provided to diagnose, treat, or improve an individual’s mental health or behavioral health” unless they are conducted by a licensed professional. Several platforms allow users to converse with customized AI chatbots tweaked to project a specific personality or demeanor — including “licensed therapists.” Some start-ups also market AI services specifically tailored for therapeutic purposes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advocates say AI services, especially those developed with therapy in mind, can be a helpful and always available remedy for those struggling to access professional help. A February study by University of California at Berkeley researchers found that chatbots can tend toward encouraging harmful behavior by users when asked, including recommending a hypothetical addict take methamphetamine. Vaile Wright, senior director for the office of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, said that’s “the opposite of what therapists do.” Advertisement “Therapists are validating, but it’s also our job to point out when somebody is engaging in unhealthy thoughts, feelings, behaviors and then help somebody challenge those and find better options,” Wright said. “What that means, fundamentally, is that a large portion of the economy is regulated to be human-centric.” “Allowing an AI service to exist is actually going to be, I think, a lot more difficult in practice than people imagine,” he added. Wright, of the American Psychological Association, said that even if states crack down on AI services advertising themselves as therapeutic tools, people are likely to continue turning to AI for emotional support.

Nevertheless, "we do think there are pockets of undervaluation [in the S & P 500] and we think that is the better place to be putting new monies," he said. "We do expect a rotation [into] some of these undervalued areas."

Article: In late March, for example, Donald Trump signed an executive order that directly took aim at the Smithsonian and its museums, directing officials to eliminate “improper, divisive, or anti-American” ideology from the institution. Trump went on to characterize the Smithsonian as an institution that was “once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement” — before it fell victim to a nefarious ideology that the Republican considers “divisive.” All of this was ridiculous, but it was merely the first in a series of steps. A few months later, the president announced that he’d fired the director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, despite questions about whether he had the legal authority to do so. More recently, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History decided to alter an exhibit that referenced Trump’s impeachments — in ways that failed to fully reflect the truth — creating a brazen example of trying to rewrite history. Late last week, the museum restored information about the incumbent president to a display on presidential impeachments, but the new version wasn’t necessarily improved: It made changes to the original and removed some details. The Wall Street Journal reported: The White House plans to conduct a far-reaching review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America’s 250th anniversary to ensure the museums align with President Trump’s interpretation of American history. In a letter sent to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, three top White House officials said they want to ensure the museums’ ‘unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story’ and reflect the president’s executive order calling for ‘Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.’ The Journal’s report, which has been independently verified by NBC News, added that Team Trump intends to scrutinize everything “from public-facing exhibition text and online content to internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants.” The new letter to the Smithsonian Institution’s secretary, dated Aug. 12, added that this effort is intended to “restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” Of course, there’s no reason to believe that Americans have lost confidence in the Smithsonian, just as there’s no reason to believe the public will feel greater confidence in the museums after Team Trump advances its wildly unnecessary initiative. (The letter was signed by White House senior associate Lindsey Halligan, the director of the domestic policy council, Vince Haley, and the director of the office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought.) I’m mindful that Trump’s political allies often express discomfort when his critics accuse him of authoritarianism, but if Republicans want to discredit such concerns, perhaps White House officials shouldn’t tell museums that they’ll be reviewing exhibits to ensure the president’s ideology is reflected. The title of the White House’s order from March said the directive was intended to restore “sanity to American history.” Given the circumstances, “sanity” is not the word that comes to mind.

There was no formal announcement of the launch of the offensive in Bajaur, a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, but a government administrator, Saeed Ullah, said it was not a large-scale operation and only insurgent hideouts were being hit to avoid civilian casualties. On Tuesday, the provincial government in the northwest said it will give 50,000 rupees ($175) in compensation to each displaced family in Bajaur, where volunteers from the Al-Khidmat Foundation, a charity, were also seen distributing food among displaced families. Among those displaced is Gul Wali, 50, who said it was the second time that he had been forced to flee his home, as he sat in a government shelter, “although we have been told we will return to our village soon.” READ MORE: Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan and nearly 200 supporters sentenced over 2023 riots Wali said most homes in his village in the Mamund district were destroyed during the previous military offensive in 2009.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey) People, who were affected by a water main break that that led to reduced service to nearly 200,000 homes and businesses, pick up cases of bottled water at John F. -- Water pressure was improving Tuesday for thousands of frustrated residents in a northern New Jersey city with little or no service since a water main break late last week, but a boil water advisory for nearly 200,000 customers remained in effect. Improvement began hours after crews isolated the leak Monday night, though officials said Tuesday that they still have not reached the broken main, which is some 30 feet underground in Paterson. “We’re getting reports and we’re seeing on our own gauges that pressure is starting to come up in parts of the system.” The problems began Friday when the roughly 140-year-old water main broke. It’s just depressing.” The boil water order issued by the commission asks residents not to fill large jugs or containers, water lawns or open hydrants until at least Friday, and officials warned that the order may remain in effect until sometime next week.

Article: Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal that he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for copying an indigenous shoe design Sandals known as "huaraches" are displayed for sale at a market in Oaxaca, Mexico, Friday, Aug. (AP Photo/Luis Alberto Cruz) MEXICO CITY -- Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for imitating an Indigenous shoe design. Mexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag. In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote. “This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations.

Article: President Donald Trump (L) invites Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to speak in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on "Investing in America" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. The Trump administration is still working out the details of its 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD and could bring deals of this kind to more companies, the White House's Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. "The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented," she continued. It's related to the H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S., and was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on artificial intelligence chips in 2023. Earlier this year, Nvidia said that it was on track to sell more than $8 billion worth of H20 chips in a single quarter before the Trump administration in April said that it would require a license to export the chip.

Article: “It only saves the lives of Israeli soldiers.” He did not clarify what the Popular Forces would do exactly, but experts believe Israel is backing the militia and its leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, to put a Palestinian face on the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Abu Shabab emerges Abu Shabab, who leads the 100-man-strong Popular Forces militia, is an elementary school dropout, according to Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Despite this, he has a sophisticated and multilingual social media presence, and he recently penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming that Palestinians in Gaza were done with Hamas. He’s basically a front guy.” Advertisement His own tribe, the Tarabin, does not approve of his role in Gaza today, making a rare public statement disavowing him for allegedly collaborating with Israel. “His gang emerges a month later and becomes the main gang that loots the overwhelming majority of food and aid that’s going into Gaza systematically under [Israeli military] protection,” Shehada said. During the brief ceasefire that Israel unilaterally broke in March, Abu Shabab disappeared, only to reappear in mid-May when Israel, under immense international pressure, started to allow a trickle of aid back into Gaza. “He’s been the face of Israel’s hunger campaign,” Shehada said, “while giving Israel full deniability of it and outsourcing the thing.” A Palestinian face to ethnic cleansing Beyond the stealing of aid meant for starving Palestinians, analysts said Abu Shabab and his militia are contributing to a wider Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza, which has been intensifying this year. “Israel is in the process of trying to build up the militias associated with Abu Shabab in hopes that they can expand the concentration camp zones over which those militias can operate/control so that Israel can reduce the burden of occupation while facilitating the ethnic cleansing,” Tariq Kenney Shawa, the US policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian policy network, told Al Jazeera. Advertisement Abu Shabab’s militia has been building what analysts are calling concentration camps in southern Gaza, in an effort to drive more than half a million Palestinians there before being displaced to third countries. “The intention is to hold them there until an opportunity arises to send them elsewhere outside of Gaza, be that Egypt or any number of third countries,” Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said. “Israel understands that if the [Israeli army] operates a concentration camp in Rafah, it wouldn’t look very nice,” Shehada told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel would prefer “a Palestinian face that’s dressed in Palestinian uniforms with a Palestinian flag and speaking in Arabic” as the face of such an operation. In addition, he said, Abu Shabab has “two very well-oiled Facebook propaganda machineries” that could convince desperate people to seek shelter in his camps, “especially if Israel [begins] forcefully pushing people there.” “Abu Shabab’s militia is running smaller concentration camps within areas Israel controls and has advertised them as ‘safe havens’ for people to come get aid and set up tents and such,” Kenney Shawa said. But the GHF has been widely lambasted by aid groups and the UN for politicising aid, and Israeli soldiers shoot at hungry Palestinians every day as they try to secure aid for their families. Worsening the situation is that, instead of some 400 aid distribution points that the UNRWA used to operate in Gaza, the GHF has only four sites in the whole Gaza Strip.

Article: out of $5 million by posing over the phone as their grandchildren in need of help — sometimes targeting the same victims over and over — federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Grandparents in Massachusetts, California, New York, Florida and Maryland received calls from people saying they were their grandchild and had just been in a car accident or arrested or was in the midst of another emergency, said Leah Foley, the U.S. “Many victims not only lost their savings, but their sense of safety, judgment and trust in the world around them.” Prosecutors said the defendants ran a sophisticated criminal enterprise from organized call centers in the Dominican Republic. In other cases, prosecutors said they followed a vague script, identifying themselves as “your oldest grandson.” Call center employees allegedly kept track of the money they earned on a whiteboard, prosecutors said. Most of them face a conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud charge, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, and a money laundering conspiracy charge, which is also punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Ted Docks, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston field office, said criminals overseas are “doing this in epidemic levels.” “What the accused did in targeting our seniors was calculated, cold-hearted and cruel,” he said.

"New York City has the most confusing and unfair property tax system in the country," said Iziah Thompson, a senior policy analyst with the Community Service Society of New York. "This system that we have here that's reaching its 50th anniversary and for all that time it has been very complicated and has really not been fairly applied to all housing types and to all people." The city collects property taxes based on a series of laws that were passed nearly five decades ago. "I think it goes back to when the bill was first passed 40 years ago and I think we recognize today we really need that." When homeowners don't pay their taxes, they can be placed on the city's Tax Lien Sale list. "This past year we worked with City Council to draft and pass a bill that will give us a lot more tools to help people resolve their debt and give them more time and assistance." The city made two improvements to the lien sale this year.

Article: Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) will send a team of investigators to the Clairton Coke Works facility, about 15 miles outside of Pittsburgh, the agency said in a news release. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Records show that the Clairton Coke Works facility has been cited for troubles containing combustible gases, racking up tens of millions of dollars in fines in the last few years, and has faced lawsuits from environmental groups. Advertisement In recent years, some facilities have been trying to move toward using less flammable gases to reduce the risk of explosions, but that push can also come with new problems, Baker said. The Clairton plant accounted for at least $57 million in fines, penalties and enforcement actions by the Allegheny County Health Department since 2020, according to an analysis by The Washington Post of data provided by the Breathe Project. According to Environmental Protection Agency data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group, the plant has been in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act for the past 12 quarters and has amassed more than $10.6 million in EPA penalties over the past five years. Steel more than $2.2 million after issuing an enforcement order against the plant because it had unsafe amounts of the flammable gas hydrogen sulfide in the air more for than 59 days in an 18-month stretch. Steel could not fully process the raw gas, but kept burning it as fuel,” he wrote, “That emitted pollutants into the air.” Advertisement The Allegheny County Health Department later joined the lawsuit, which was settled in 2024. Advertisement Advertisement “The Clairton plant is a very old facility that is forced to operate with little to no margin for error, and therefore presents a constant air pollution threat to the community,” wrote environmental engineer Ranajit Sahu. The explosion follows a recent announcement from the Trump administration that gives polluting industries around the country more time to comply with EPA regulations and is intended to reduce emissions from toxic air pollution. The local EPA office said it is actively monitoring the situation and is ready to support local and state partners, adding that it will work with state and county agencies to review compliance of facilities.

Article: A memorial dedicated to the 19 children and two adults murdered on May 24, 2022 during the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School is seen on May 24, 2023 in Uvalde, Texas. Two months before a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the school district's then-police chief was required to attend a training about how to respond to an active shooter, which instructed in no uncertain terms that an "officer's first priority is to move in and confront the attacker." When Pete Arredondo, the police chief of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District at the time of the May 2022 shooting, was confronted with precisely the situation his training should have prepared him for, he did the opposite of what the training instructed would have saved lives, according to a newly released trove of documents from the Uvalde school district. "The best hope that innocent victims have is that officers immediately move into action to isolate, distract, or neutralize the threat, even if that means one officer acting alone." More than three years after the shooting and the training designed to prevent it, Arredondo continues to fight a criminal case that alleges that he was responsible for putting students in danger by waiting 77 minutes to confront the gunman, who had holed up in adjoining fourth-grade classrooms. The records of the active shooter training were included in a trove of documents released by the Uvalde School District on Monday, following a years-long effort to withhold the documents about the school district's response, security, and police training. After years of requests from the families of victims, the public, and media organizations, including ABC News, the records were released on the eve of the new school year, as prosecutors prepare to bring two former school district police leaders, including Arredondo, to trial. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, said in a statement to ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." "I'm not sure if my battle for transparency will ever truly be over," said Gloria Cazares, the mother of 9-year-old Jackie Cazares, who was killed in the massacre. If we can't get justice, then the very least we deserve is every piece of evidence, every record, every truth that has been kept from us." Among the hundreds of pages released, the records suggest that the flawed response was not because of a lack of training, but in spite of it. The Texas state legislature passed a law in 2019 that required school resource officers and police to participate in an approved active shooting training within 180 days of their employment. "A first responder unwilling to place the lives of the innocent above their own safety should consider another career field." The training also includes material about the flaws in the emergency response to the February 2018 deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where officers faced criticism for staging outside the building while the shooting took place. According to the materials, the training in Texas was mandated to prevent a similar tragedy from taking place, where a delayed law enforcement response could potentially contribute to additional casualties. The 18-year-old student was disciplined for inappropriate behavior at least 18 times between 2015 and 2018, including bullying other classmates, using inappropriate and sexual language, and fighting his peers, the documents say. Speaking to ABC News after the shooting, Reyes said her son could be "aggressive" but he was not a "monster." "We all have a rage, that some people have it more than others," Reyes said In November of 2015, a disciplinary write-up noted Ramos wrote "I'm gay" on the back of another student's artwork planning sheet, according to the documents. Also that March, he was written up for "'using sexual language' after repeatedly [being] told to stop." When told to do his work by a teacher, the documents say he flashed the "L" loser sign and was placed under in-school suspension.

Article: The Food and Drug Administration is weighing revoking its authorization of Pfizer 's Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children under the age of 5, the drugmaker confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. While Covid typically causes mild symptoms in most children, others, such as infants under 1 or those with certain health conditions, can be at a higher risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Pfizer said it has requested the authorization to remain in place for the upcoming fall and winter season and is "currently in discussions with the agency on potential paths forward." The company said that the FDA's "deliberations" are not related to the safety and efficacy of the shot, "which continues to demonstrate a favorable profile." The Guardian first reported on the FDA's potential move. In July, the FDA granted full approval to Moderna's Covid vaccine for children — but only for those with health conditions that may put them at increased risk of severe illness if they become infected.

(AP Photo/Becky Bohrer, File) A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream. The Mendenhall Glacier — a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska — acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. But 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city’s engineering and public works department. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: WASHINGTON — A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island’s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants’ misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.” Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training." The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable." “This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project," the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani’s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.” The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with (Ohtani) than honoring its obligations to its business partners.” Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-appeals-court-economy-great-depression-rcna224525
Article: On Monday, the Justice Department basically copied and pasted a hysterical plea from Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, in which the president claimed the country would experience another Great Depression if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirms and enforces a May decision from a Court of International Trade panel that found many of Trump’s tariffs on foreign countries were illegal. In a letter to the court, Solicitor General John Sauer and Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate argued that even if the judges agree that some of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, they should hold off on enforcing its decision while the administration appeals to the Supreme Court. One year ago, the United States was a dead country, and now, because of the trillions of dollars being paid by countries that have so badly abused us, America is a strong, financially viable, and respected country again. If the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect. In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hard-working Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened. The country, of course, wasn’t “dead” a year ago — though it has teetered on the brink of recession under Trump and continues to suffer the impact of his protectionist agenda. There’s also no guarantee that Trump’s trade agreements will ever bring in trillions of dollars, in part because, as my colleague Steve Benen recently noted, it’s still an open question whether some of the agreements are even legally binding or enforceable. And it’s certainly rich for Trump’s DOJ to warn about purported threats to jobs, Medicare and Social Security when his administration has gutted the federal workforce and he recently signed a budget that includes massive cuts to Medicare and Social Security benefits. To the contrary, many American consumers and companies would probably breathe a sigh of relief if they were freed from the dictatorial whim of their wannabe king and the tariff-induced taxes effectively placed on various goods.

Article: President Donald Trump’s Monday press conference painted a gruesome picture of a crime-ridden Washington, D.C., as he ordered the National Guard deployed in the city and laid out his plans to “rescue our nation’s capitol from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” But official data gives us a much different picture. Philadelphia recorded the fewest murders seen in the city since 1969, Baltimore since 1965, Detroit since 1964, and San Francisco had the fewest ever recorded (monthly data available to 1960). And it doesn’t reflect a recent change in national immigration policy; the decline began in 2023, so the main drivers likely began to take shape when immigration was at its peak. When trying to account for all of the factors, the most compelling explanation to me, as someone who works in crime data, could be most eloquently summed up as “we spent a lot of money on a lot of stuff.” For example, local and state government construction surged in the wake of the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act. The city’s murder count was cut in half by the end of 2024 and New Orleans recorded the fewest murders through June since 1970, in spite of the terrorist attack on Jan. A stable city budget and money from the federal and state governments enabled local street construction to surge by 180% between 2020 and 2024, helped along by new infrastructure construction related to the city’s hosting of this year’s Super Bowl. The Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office launched an extensive place-based violence reduction program called N.O.D.I.C.E., which uses a technique called Risk Terrain Modeling to identify “vulnerable areas” and deliver resources. From a traditional law enforcement standpoint, NOPD launched a joint task force with various federal entities while the state police deployed a task force of roughly 20 officers starting in mid-2024. Criminologists still aren’t sure why murder fell so precipitously in the 1990s, so we don’t know precisely which of these steps taken in New Orleans have been most important in driving down gun violence and other crimes. But intensive investment in communities like New Orleans in the wake of the pandemic — spurring construction, economic stability and innovative municipal programming — stands out as a strong explanation for much of the decline.

Article: KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. focusing on ending the war have not touched on security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future Russian aggression and that meeting formats currently being discussed do not include Europe’s participation, both key demands of Kyiv. Zelenskyy says Ukraine will not withdraw from the Donbas Zelenskyy said Putin wants the remaining 9,000 square kilometers (3,500 square miles) of Donetsk under Kyiv’s control, where the war’s toughest battles are grinding on, as part of a ceasefire plan, in a press briefing on Tuesday in Kyiv. READ MORE: Trump suggests he’ll know if Putin wants a peace deal with Ukraine soon into their meeting Zelenskyy learned of Russia’s position after holding a call with Trump and special envoy Steve Witkoff, after the latter’s bilateral meeting with Putin. The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Their leaders said Tuesday they “welcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.” But, they underlined, “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and “international borders must not be changed by force.” The Europeans on Wednesday will make a fresh attempt to rally Trump to Ukraine’s cause at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is Putin’s closest ally in Europe and has tried to block EU support for Ukraine, was the only one of the bloc’s 27 leaders who refused to endorse it. The region’s Ukrainian military command on social media Monday acknowledged that the situation remains “difficult, unpleasant and dynamic.” Elsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile attack on a military training facility left one soldier dead and 11 others wounded, the Ukrainian Ground Forces posted on social media.

Article: Danielle Spencer, a former child actor best known for her role as Dee in the 1970s sitcom "What's Happening!!", has died, a publicist for her family confirmed to ABC News. "She is a sweet and gentle soul and she is going to be missed very, very much." Spencer starred in 65 episodes of "What's Happening!!", an ABC sitcom about three teenage boys growing up in the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, according to IMDb. Jeremy Pelt shared a tribute to his sister on Instagram Tuesday, writing, "Many of you knew her as 'Dee,' but she was more than a child actress." "She was a friend, an auntie to my three children who adored her, she was a daughter- and in many ways, my mother's best friend, she was a veterinarian, she was someone who always remained positive even during her darkest days fighting this disease," he continued. "And she was MY sister and protector." He added that he was "thankful" to be with his sister when she took her last breath and was "gutted" by her death, writing, "I love you, forever." In a 2016 interview with a local Richmond TV station, Spencer reflected on her acting career being featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. "I mean, first of all, that the show is remembered from 40 years [ago], but then also to be featured in this museum along with other shows that have been trailblazers." Spencer said that her late stepfather brought her into the world of acting. At age 9, she said she got the call that she had won the role of Dee in "What's Happening!!" "A month later I got a phone call, and they said, 'Fly out to California.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon should either replace his economist or "just focus on being a DJ," days after the bank's economist warned that American consumers will pay for an increasing share of new tariffs. "They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else," the president wrote. "I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution." Trump did not name the economist he wants Solomon to replace. But Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist since 2011, warned in a research note on Sunday that American consumers will end up absorbing an increasing share of the cost of Trump's tariffs. "Our estimates imply that US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June but that their share will likely rise to 67% by October if the later tariffs have the same impact over time as the earliest tariffs," Hatzius and other Goldman researchers wrote.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article The White House is conducting an expansive review of the Smithsonian's museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America’s 250th anniversary to ensure it aligns with President Donald Trump's views of history, an administration official confirmed to NBC News. The assessment, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will include reviews of museum exhibitions, online content, internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants, and wording related to museum exhibit messaging, the official said. “This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the administration official quoted the letter as saying. The official said the review is aimed at making sure the museums reflect the “unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story” and reflect the president’s executive order calling for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” That order, which was signed on March 27, calls for removing "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. "The Smithsonian museums and exhibits should be accurate, patriotic, and enlightening—ensuring they remain places of learning, wonder, and national pride for generations to come.” The impeachment exhibition at The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, on Aug. Andrew Leyden / ZUMA Press Wire via Reuters NBC News reported in May that historical leaders and critics were questioning why exhibits at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall were rotating out. Among those items were Harriet Tubman’s book of hymns filled with gospels that she is believed to have sung as she led enslaved people to freedom through the underground railroad, and the “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,” the memoir by one of the most important leaders in the abolition movement. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History also recently made headlines after it removed a placard referring to Trump from an impeachment exhibit, sparking concerns over his influence on the cultural institution. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.” “[W]e will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness –- igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans,” the order said.

Article: The current version of the bill would give power to the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) to "require the appropriate municipality or county to install, maintain, and operate one or more outdoor warning sirens." The TWDB would only be able to do this after determining that an area "has a history of consistent or severe flooding." The board would consider several factors including "previous loss of human life to flooding" in the area and "the potential damage to real or personal property" in the area. The bill states, "The board ’s determinations under this section on whether an area requires an outdoor warning siren are final and binding." If a county or city already had an acceptable siren system in place, they would not be required to change it. Bettencourt also spoke to Upper Guadalupe River Authority President Bill Rector about sirens during that hearing and Rector said "there is no question that that could save lives." The current version of SB2 would require the governor's office to establish and administer the grant program that would pay for the siren warning systems. "Having the governor's office be involved in it is not doing anything except keep the accelerator pedal down on making sure the projects get done as quickly as possible," Bettencourt said.

Meanwhile Moscow's troops have continued their summer offensive, making a sudden thrust near the eastern Ukrainian town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. Moscow now holds almost all of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk but speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would reject any proposal to leave the Donbas. "If we withdraw from the Donbas today - our fortifications, our terrain, the heights we control - we will clearly open a bridgehead for the Russians to prepare an offensive," he said. Last week Trump said there would be "some swapping of territories to the betterment of both" Russia and Ukraine - sparking concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Moscow could be allowed to redraw Ukraine's borders by force.

Article: The document, previously seen as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government, significantly reduces criticism of some US allies such as Israel and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and South Africa. The language used echoes previous criticism by the Trump administration and some US tech bosses who oppose online harm reduction laws in some European countries, portraying them as attacks on free speech. Uzra Zeya, a former senior state department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, accused the Trump administration of "gutting" decades of highly respected work on human rights protections and an "abandonment of core values" to the US. "It sends a signal that there's going to be a free pass from the United States government, that it will look the other way if a government is willing to cut deals or do the bidding of this administration," she told the BBC. It follows internal guidance issued by political leaders earlier this year reportedly advising staff to shorten the reports to remove some references to issues including corruption and gender-based crimes, and follows some executive orders on related issues issued by President Trump.

Article: As he seeks to boost his campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo is proposing an overhaul to New York City’s rent laws and escalating his attacks on the frontrunner, Zohran Mamdani NEW YORK -- Andrew Cuomo is demanding that his opponent in New York City's mayoral race, Zohran Mamdani, vacate his rent stabilized apartment, while pushing a longshot proposal that would bar other middle-class renters from accessing much of the city’s housing. “I am calling on you to move out immediately,” Cuomo wrote in a widely-viewed social media post this weekend, casting Mamdani as “a very rich person” occupying an apartment that could otherwise be used by a homeless family. The line of attack drew tens of millions of views online and revived a long-standing debate about who should have access to New York’s highly sought-after rent stabilized units, which make up roughly 40% of the city’s rental stock and are currently open to people of all incomes. It also illustrated the rhetorical lengths that Cuomo is willing to go to as he mounts an independent bid for mayor against Mamdani, a democratic socialist who defeated him handily in the Democratic primary on a platform that centered on affordability and freezing rent on stabilized units. Mamdani, who earns $143,000 annually as a state legislator, has said he pays $2,300 per month for a one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife — a living situation that Cuomo called “disgusting.” By contrast, Cuomo, a multimillionaire who previously served as the state's governor, spends roughly $8,000 monthly on an apartment in Midtown Manhattan that he moved to last year from Westchester County, a wealthy suburb. In recent weeks, the 67-year-old Cuomo has adopted a more aggressive social media presence, earning both praise and mockery for his use of millennial internet-speak and repeated references to his opponent’s “privilege.” Mamdani’s mother is a successful independent filmmaker and his father is a Columbia University professor. On Monday, Cuomo went a step further, releasing a formal proposal, which he dubbed “Zohran’s Law,” barring landlords from leasing vacant rent stabilized units to “wealthy tenants,” defined as those who would pay less than 30% of their income toward the existing rent. The rent regulation program, which caps how much landlords can raise rent each year on roughly 1 million apartments, does not currently include any income restrictions — something opponents have long pushed to change. While the average rent stabilized household makes $60,000 annually, it is not uncommon for middle- or higher-income New Yorkers to live in the units, which sometimes rent for several thousand dollars per month. “The idea that we should only have people living in apartments they can’t afford seems to be setting people up for failure,” said Ellen Davidson, a housing attorney at The Legal Aid Society. “It’s not a proposal from somebody who knows anything about the housing market or New York City.” The Real Estate Board of New York, a landlord group whose members overwhelmingly backed Cuomo in the primary, did not respond to an inquiry about whether they supported the proposal. But in an email, the group’s president, James Whelan, said that the “benefits of rent regulation are not well targeted” and that some form of means testing should be considered. “Rent stabilization has never been means tested because it’s not an affordable housing program, it’s a program about neighborhood stability,” said Davidson, the housing attorney, adding that the proposal would likely present a “bureaucratic nightmare.” A spokesperson for Cuomo’s campaign, Rich Azzopardi, said in a text message that “the ultra wealthy and privileged should not be taking advantage of a program meant to aide working New Yorkers," adding that the income threshold standards would fall under the same system that governs the city's other programs for low-income housing. “While Cuomo cares only for the well-being of his Republican donors, Zohran believes city government’s job is to guarantee a life of dignity, not determine who is worth one,” she added.

Article: -- Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao's enduring status as a powerhouse couple was on display Tuesday as they reflected on their shared lives at a ceremony for the archives that will catalogue their careers. "We needed an archive largely because I never threw anything away.” The collection will span their decades of public life and offer a “front-row view of how our government and institutions operate,” McConnell said in a news release. At Tuesday's event, Chao referred to McConnell as her “best friend and teammate and also the man who is at the center of my life, the man who supported my career in public service.” She called her husband the ”most prolific" Senate party leader in history and said Kentucky continues to “reap the benefits” from his tenure. And thank you, again.” UofL President Gerry Bradley said the archives will be an “invaluable source” for scholars and historians by offering insights into the careers of McConnell and Chao. McConnell quipped that his political enemies “have been deterred from seeing any of this.” Another campus initiative close to McConnell's heart has been the McConnell Center, a nonpartisan academic program at the university that aims to prepare students for future leadership roles. The program's graduates have pursued a variety of professions — including public service, business and medicine — and many have returned to make their lives and careers in Kentucky, McConnell said.

Article: Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state’s process to get citizens’ initiatives on the ballot Campaign groups urge judge to further limit new restrictions on getting measures on Florida's ballot TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a federal judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state’s process to get citizens’ initiatives on the ballot. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee were the latest attempt by attorneys for voter advocacy groups and campaigns for Medicaid expansion and recreational marijuana to carve away at a law that they argue unconstitutionally hamstrings citizens' abilities to amend Florida's constitution. So far, Walker has issued mixed rulings in the case, freezing some portions of the law but allowing other parts to go into effect, even as the campaigns try to gather enough signatures from voters to qualify for the 2026 ballot. “They should seek their strongest basis for relief the first time, or in this case the second time, and we should move on from there," Jazil said of the plaintiffs. Legislatures in dozens of states have advanced bills recently to crack down on the public’s ability to put measures up for a vote, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. Under Florida’s law, an individual could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don’t register with the state as a petition circulator. The Republican-controlled Legislature pushed the changes months after a majority of Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.

Article: A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's “Mornings with Maria” that the administration is “laser-focused on bringing this deficit down.” The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.

Article: Coming off a rare losing season — just his second since taking over in 2005 — in which the Cowboys finished 3-9, Gundy now faces the challenge of rebuilding a team capable of competing for a conference championship. They just showed up in June — 18 of those are transfers and the rest are high school players." There are a lot of unknowns — even for a veteran coach — and Gundy isn’t shy about acknowledging that. "Wherever you find the quarterback who can be productive, provide leadership, and the team will rally around him to get the best chance to win, then Coach Meacham and his staff have to find a way to build the offense around that player." The Cowboys have yet to settle on a starting quarterback, as redshirt freshmen Hauss Hejny and Zane Flores remain in a tight competition during fall camp.

Article: government.” The MSNBC host noted that Long’s “crowning achievement” during his time at the agency was sending “jolly all-staff emails.” Last week, Long sent a message to employees that read, in part, “With this being Thursday before another FriYay, please enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you’ll be well rested for my 70th birthday on Monday.” Just hours after he sent that email, Long’s short tenure at the IRS came to an end, when he announced the president intended to nominate him to serve as ambassador to Iceland. While Maddow acknowledged the optics of Long’s departure may seem amusing, she told viewers there was “something else going on here” that she said was a “big deal.” Maddow referenced reporting from The Washington Post in April, that detailed Trump’s plan to use the IRS in the Department of Homeland Security’s effort to find and arrest immigrants. “Homeland Security told the IRS to go into private tax information and hand over not just names, but home addresses and phone numbers and email addresses — all this specific private information — so Homeland Security could use that information to go find people and arrest them,” Maddow explained, citing the Post’s reporting. “It was after that dispute,” Maddow noted, “that the White House reportedly decided to remove Billy Long from his job running the IRS, to instead ship him to Iceland.” “Now, we do not know whether Billy Long himself was involved in this clash. government is now using sensitive, private information from people’s taxes, including names and addresses and phone numbers, to help Trump’s immigration police track people down and arrest them.” Maddow called the situation “truly unprecedented” in the United States. “We don’t know what else they might do with this kind of detailed personal information extracted from the IRS, nor do we know what an IRS minus Billy Long might newly be willing to hand over,” Maddow concluded. “But that is where Trump has now taken this country, with or without sad, old Billy Long.” You can watch Maddow’s full comments in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: government's budget deficit grew nearly 20% in July to $291 billion despite a nearly $21 billion jump in customs duty collections from President Donald Trump's tariffs, with outlays growing faster than receipts, the Treasury Department said on Tuesday. The month of July this year had fewer business days than last year, so the Treasury Department said that adjusting for the difference would have increased receipts by about $20 billion, resulting in a deficit of about $271 billion. Net customs receipts in July grew to about $27.7 billion from about $7.1 billion in the year-earlier period due to higher tariff rates imposed by Trump, a Treasury official said. Consumer price index data on Tuesday showed increases in prices for some tariff-sensitive goods like furniture, footwear and auto parts, but they were offset by lower gasoline prices in the overall index. Receipts were up 6%, or $262 billion, to $4.347 trillion, a record high for the 10-month period, while outlays grew 7%, or $374 billion, to $5.975 trillion, also a 10-month record.

Article: President Javier Milei of Argentina has proposed a new $1m initiative to strengthen relations between Latin America and Israel, ahead of an anticipated visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Monday, the Genesis Prize Foundation — a group that offers an annual award to members of the Jewish community — announced that Milei, its most recent winner, would use his prize money to launch a new nonprofit, the American Friends of the Isaac Accords (AFOIA). “AFOIA is a vehicle to promote Milei’s bold vision and encourage other Latin American leaders to stand with Israel, confront antisemitism, and reject the ideologies of terror that threaten our shared values and freedoms,” Genesis Prize co-founder Stan Polovets said in a news release. During Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021, countries like Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in a series of deals known as the Abraham Accords. Countries like Colombia and Bolivia have severed diplomatic ties with Israel since the start of the war in 2023, and Brazil recently became the latest nation to join a case against Israel brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice. Advertisement “The Isaac Accords aim to mirror the success of the Abraham Accords by fostering diplomatic, economic, and cultural cooperation between Israel and key Latin American nations,” the news release said. “Given the hostility toward the Jewish state from some nations in the region, support of Israel by Latin American countries which are now on the sidelines is very important,” Danon said in the release. Top leaders like Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have forcefully denounced the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza, where more than 61,500 Palestinians have been killed and many risk perishing from hunger. “We cannot remain indifferent to the genocide carried out by Israel in Gaza, the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and the use of hunger as a weapon of war,” Brazil’s President Lula told the BRICS economic alliance in July. In June, for example, Milei confirmed his intention to move Argentina’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 2026, despite conflicting Israeli and Palestinian claims on the city. Advertisement Milei has also praised Israel for its human rights record, including in a social media post this past May honouring the 77th anniversary of its establishment in 1948, which resulted in the mass displacement of Palestinians. “Like Argentina, Israel is a beacon of FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY.” Milei, a Catholic, has even expressed interest in converting to Judaism, which would be a first for an Argentinian president. His selection as the 2025 Genesis Prize winner is considered a first for a non-Jewish person, and it is tradition for winners to give the cash award to a cause they support. In 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to believe they had overseen war crimes in Gaza.

Article: A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream. READ MORE: 7.3 magnitude earthquake stirs tsunami warning along parts of Alaska’s southern coast “This will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,” Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday. The Mendenhall Glacier — a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska — acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. But 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. READ MORE: Avalanche south of Anchorage buries at least 3 skiers, Alaska officials say City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city’s engineering and public works department. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: Ever since he transferred to the University of Oklahoma last winter, scrutiny has followed John Mateer for how the quarterback, rated one of the best in college football, would perform on the field. This week, Mateer has found himself under the spotlight for different reasons after screenshots from his personal Venmo account surfaced on social media showing two transactions labeled “sports gambling." Both transactions were from Nov. The NCAA prohibits student-athletes and staff members from betting on sports, no matter whether at the collegiate, professional or amateur level, and breaking those rules can cost athletes their remaining eligibility. Mateer published a statement to social media Tuesday denying wrongdoing, saying that "I have not engaged in any sports gambling" and characterized the labeling of the transactions as "inside jokes between me and my friends. Mateer threw for 29 touchdowns and rushed for 15 more in 2024 during his first season as the starter at Washington State, and in December he announced his transfer to Oklahoma, a longtime power in college football attempting a revival after a pair of 6-7 seasons since 2022. Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and effectively opened the floodgates for regulated, legal sports betting in the country, the NCAA has joined other major sports leagues in wrestling with the change. When the NCAA in 2023 surveyed more than 500 on-campus athletic department employees who are tasked with ensuring compliance with NCAA rules, it found that although more than 95% of Division I schools were teaching sports-betting education, 27% of schools "had dealt with a sports betting problem among their athletes or staff within the past year, a substantial increase from a survey in 2019," according to an NCAA release. In June, the NCAA announced it was seeking to relax some of its former sports gambling regulations when the Division I Council, which oversees regulations for the NCAA's largest schools, proposed a change that would allow both student-athletes and staff members to bet on pro sports.

Article: The Crystal Palace, a music and dining joint in Bakersfield launched by Buck Owens — which hosted just about every country music star in America over the years — has abruptly shut its doors. The closure of the temple of country music, an important piece of San Joaquin Valley history, prompted an outpouring of grief from fans across the country — along with desperate pleas to stars such as Dwight Yoakam, Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift, who all played there, to save the day by buying the place. “This is so sad,” one person wrote on the Crystal Palace Instagram, tagging Dwight Yoakam and Garth Brooks and pleading with them to “keep the Crystal Palace open!” Advertisement Archival photo of Buck Owens Crystal Palace, located at 2800 Buck Owens Blvd. (Eliza Green / The Bakersfield Californian) Jim Shaw, director of the Buck Owens Private Foundation, which has owned the Crystal Palace since Owens’ death in 2006, said the closure, which was announced Monday, has “been coming for a while, and I’ve dreaded seeing it happen.” Shaw said the pandemic, along with a slowing economy and the increasingly tight margins for the restaurant business, all combined to make it “a tough business.” Plus, he added, members of the Owens family involved in the business “are in their mid- to late 70s. (Eliza Green / The Bakersfield Californian) A child of the Dust Bowl, Owens was born in Texas and spent much of his childhood in Arizona before popping up in Bakersfield‘s nascent music club scene. Some of his hits included “Together Again,” “Crying Time,” “Love’s Gonna Live Here,” “I’ve Got a Tiger by the Tail” and “Under Your Spell Again.” Advertisement It also included “Streets of Bakersfield,” which became a late-career hit with Yoakam and included these lyrics: “How many of you that sit and judged me ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?” The “Bakersfield Sound” was further cemented by another one-time member of Owens’ band, Merle Haggard, who played with the Buckaroos briefly in the 1960s. Pretty much anybody in country music played here … Taylor Swift, and Garth Brooks, and Willie Nelson, Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley.” Brooks, he noted, famously proposed to his wife Trisha Yearwood there in 2005. “I loved him,” Yoakam told The Times in 2007, shortly after Owens’ death, noting that their relationship was “part friend, part sibling, and a whole lot surrogate parent.” The Buck Owens Foundation listed the building for sale last year . The website SavingCountryMusic.com noted that the Crystal Palace is joining other small country music venues that are struggling with the new economics of the music business, which favor large arenas. “The plight for legendary, midsized country music venues continues to worsen.” Fans who are hoping that a music lover with deep pockets will swoop in and save the place can find both despair and inspiration in Owens’ lyrics. He did, after all, warn in “The Heartaches Have Just Started” that “when you see the backdoor swinging, you’ll know I’ve run out of hope.” But he also famously promised that “love’s gonna live here again.”

Article: Gavin Newsom and the University of California consider whether to sue the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in federal grants to ULCA, the White House on Tuesday had a terse response. “Bring it on, Gavin,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt when asked about Newsom’s opposition to a Trump plan demanding more than $1 billion and sweeping campus changes at UCLA to resolve federal antisemitism findings against the university. “This administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the First Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses and UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples that I will forward to Gavin Newsom’s press office, if he hasn’t seen them himself,” Leavitt said. Advertisement The statement was the first public comment from the White House about the high-stakes conflict between the nation’s premier public university system and the Trump administration, which has accused UCLA of violating the civil rights of Jewish students, illegally considering race in admissions and treating transgender people in sports, healthcare and campus life in ways that the government claims hinder women’s rights. Leavitt spoke after a question from The Times about how Trump would response Newsom’s comments late last week that the settlement offer for UCLA was “extortion” and “ransom.” “We’ll sue,” Newsom said Friday. In an earlier joint statement with California legislative leaders, Newsom said that the action against UCLA “isn’t about protecting Jewish students — it’s a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president. Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world.” No lawsuit has been filed and the UC board of regents, who held an emergency meeting Monday afternoon over the grant cuts, has not announced how it will proceed aside from calling Trump’s current terms “unacceptable.” Newsom sits as a voting member on the 24-person board, has appointed several of its members and can wield influence on the body, although the final decision on a lawsuit or settlement rests with the regents. Advertisement In a statement after the meeting, a UC spokesperson said the $1 billion price tag would be “devastating.” “UC’s leadership spent recent days evaluating the demand, updating the UC community, and engaging with stakeholders,” said Meredith Turner, UC senior vice president of external relations. “Our focus remains on protecting students’ access to a UC education and promoting the academic freedom, excellence, and innovation that have always been at the heart of UC’s work.” Hundreds of grants — from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy — are on hold at UCLA. Citing the reasons for the freezes, a July 30 NSF leter to UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk alleged UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.” Frenk, in a campuswide message the next day, disputed the funding halt.

AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who fatally shot three people in a Target parking lot, including a 4-year-old child and her grandfather, had a history of mental illness and opened fire randomly, police said Tuesday.

Article: A key annual United States government report on global human rights abuses has drastically shifted focus, with references removed to abuses based on sexual orientation, and poor conditions downplayed in ally nations while taking aim at those who have clashed with President Donald Trump. Released on Tuesday, the 2024 State Department Human Rights Report, was issued months late as Trump appointees altered an earlier draft dramatically to bring it in line with America First values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, and “Liberty,” and “Security of the Person.” The department referred to its new report as “streamlined” and focused on remaining “aligned to the administration’s executive orders”. While the 2023 report contains a lengthy introduction with numerous appendices and citations, the newest report has a single introductory page that stresses a desire to “minimize the amount of statistical data in the report”. Instead, the report sounds an alarm about the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues. Some 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in October 2023. While last year’s report underscored numerous acts of anti-Semitism in Hungary, noting that a local survey found half the population were “moderately or strongly anti-Semitic”, the new report says the close Trump ally has “made combating anti-Semitism a top priority, publicly emphasizing its welcoming and open environment for Jews”. The report claims “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador – where Trump has gained help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house migrant deportees in a high-security mega-prison. State Department reveals a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe. — Amnesty International USA (@amnestyusa) August 12, 2025 This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.

This year’s report was prepared following a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in April, wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”. Taking aim at Brazil and South Africa In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation had declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, among others. Advertisement Bolsonaro is on trial before the Supreme Court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 electoral loss to leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. It stated that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” In last year’s report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa. Trump, earlier this year, issued an executive order that called for the US to resettle Afrikaners, describing them as victims of “violence against racially disfavored landowners,” allegations that echoed far-right claims but which have been contested by South Africa’s government.

Article: The indictment alleges that Mr Cherizier, as well as US citizen Bazile Richardson, 48, solicited funds from Haitian diaspora community in the US to help pay gang members and buy firearms in violation of US sanctions. US federal prosecutors have announced criminal charges against Jimmy Cherizier, the Haitian gang leader known as "Barbecue" who leads an alliance of gangs that control much of the capitol of Port-au-Prince. "He's a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti." Prosecutors say he is suspected of playing a key role in the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped.

Article: President Donald Trump is taking a new look at reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug in a move that could nudge the federal government closer to an approach already embraced in many states. The Justice Department last year proposed to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD, to a less dangerous Schedule III substance, which includes such things as ketamine and some anabolic steroids. health authorities need to play a larger role in cannabis policy, report says It also could make it easier to research marijuana, since it’s very difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I substances. Trump is weighing the pros and cons of a marijuana policy change, noting it’s a “very complicated subject.” “I’ve heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana and “bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said Monday. As a candidate, Trump appeared open to relaxed regulation, posting on his social media platform last year that he would “focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug.” WATCH: How marijuana’s reclassification could change U.S. The National Sheriffs’ Association was among those submitting written opposition, highlighting prior determinations that marijuana has a “high abuse potential” and pointing to cases of “extreme intoxication” and fatal vehicle crashes. More than 64 million Americans age 12 and older — or 22.3% of people — used marijuana during the past year, according to a 2024 national survey released recently by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Article: Still, Trump probably will not want to reprise his performance at the 2018 Helsinki summit, where he swallowed Putin’s assurances that there had been no Russian meddling in the 2016 election and embarrassed the still embarrassable Republican Party. I found him very straightforward and trustworthy … I was able to get a sense of his soul”) and Barack Obama (“After my election I have more flexibility,” he said to Putin’s front-office man Dmitri Medvedev). The most positive thing that can be said about this summit is that it can be cast as a final good-faith effort by the administration to give Russia a face-saving way to cut its losses: an estimated million casualties, the loss of much of its stock of tanks and bombers, NATO’s expansion, the slow strangulation of the Russian economy, a war without end. But the price on Putin should be high: full Russian withdrawal to the lines of February 2022, continued Western military assistance to Kyiv and nothing to preclude eventual Ukrainian membership in the European Union. Putin will almost surely dismiss this as a nonstarter, even if it salvages his economy and ratifies his illegal, if probably irreversible, 2014 seizure of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. A few items to lay on the table: Working with Europe to seize the estimated $300 billion of frozen Russian government assets to serve as a funding pool for Ukrainian purchases of Western arms. Signing the bipartisan Senate sanctions bill on Russia, which includes a 500 percent tariff “on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products.” Removing all technical or targeting restrictions on Ukraine’s use of U.S.-supplied weapons.

Article: The United Nations has said that efforts to address widespread economic and political dysfunction and debilitating violence in Haiti are falling far short, with a UN response plan receiving the lowest funding of any in the world. In a briefing on Tuesday, coordinator Ulrika Richardson said that the UN hopes to raise more than $900m for Haiti this year, but that effort is just 9.2 percent funded. The lacklustre funding numbers underscore concerns over flagging international efforts to assist the Caribbean island nation, which is reeling from violence as powerful armed gangs jostle for control of territory and resources amid political and economic instability. Armed gangs, some with links to powerful political and economic figures, have taken control of large swathes of the capital of Port-au-Prince since the assassination of former president Jovenel Moise in July 2021. The UN has said that cutting off the supply of arms pouring into the country, largely smuggled from the US state of Florida, is a key step towards staunching the violence, along with applying sanctions on networks connected to the gangs. But international efforts to address the fighting thus far have little to show, and some Haitians are sceptical of such efforts given a long history of destructive interventions by outside powers.

Article: Anna "Delvey" Sorokin says she's received hundreds of death threats in the days since she was accused of dumping pet rabbits she posed with for a photoshoot in a Brooklyn park. But the headline-making New York City socialite — who vehemently denied responsibility for the discarded bunnies — said in an interview with NBC News that she's particularly shocked by the strong reaction over the incident. "I can never do right by these people." Sorokin shared screenshots of dozens of hateful messages she's received within the last few days to her Instagram — which she called "unusable" — with NBC News. Some of them suggest that she she should be killed or take her own life, including one that advises Sorokin to get someone to "make a carpet out of your skin." “It seems like a lot of these people, just because they’re engaged in animal rescue, they feel like they’re entitled to insult you or talk to you or say anything because they’re hiding behind this thing that they’re doing,” she said. The 34-year-old, whose life was depicted in Netflix's hit 2022 series "Inventing Anna," took the photoshoot with the bunnies on August 3 to create content for her Instagram account, which has more than 1.1 million followers. Shortly before the shoot, she posted on Instagram story asking if any of her followers in the New York City metropolitan area had a pet rabbit she could borrow for the shoot, Sorokin said. A Facebook user posted images of the domesticated bunnies in the park to a public Facebook group dedicated to rabbits, House Rabbit Society, and other users connected them to Sorokin's photos. At first, Batty denied dumping the rabbits in the park, according to screenshots of text messages between Sorokin, Batty and photographer Jasper Soloff that Sorokin posted on her Instagram story and shared with NBC News. "Jasper had no knowledge or input as to how the bunnies were obtained or what happened to them after the photo shoot," Soloff's attorney, Gary Adelman, said in a statement. Hours later, Batty confessed that he did dump the rabbits and absolved Sorokin of any involvement, according to a statement he posted to his Instagram account, which has since been taken down. "At 19, with no experience caring for animals, no pet-friendly housing, and no knowledge of available resources, I felt overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice." "Believing, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I released them there, thinking that was my best option," he added. Sorokin was convicted by a Manhattan jury in April 2019 on four counts of theft services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny after being accused of defrauding banks and friends of tens of thousands of dollars. Prosecutors said that Sorokin convinced friends and businesses to loan her money to afford a lavish lifestyle under the guise that she was the daughter of a oil baron or diplomat, worth tens of millions of dollars. "And I had the best intentions and it's really frustrating." The New York Times reported that the rabbits were rescued by blogger Terry Chao, who spotted the rabbits in the park.

Article: A Minnesota teen filed a charge of discrimination against a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant on Tuesday after she alleged that a server followed her into the women’s restroom and demanded she “prove” she was a girl. The man needs to get out of here,” according to Gender Justice, a Minnesota gender-equality organization that filed the charge on Mudra’s behalf Gerika Mudra, 18, says she was harassed by a server who accused her of being a boy in the girls' bathroom. Gender Justice Mudra, a biracial lesbian who is not transgender, said she’s been in similar situations before, where people have suggested she’s in the wrong restroom, but when she tells them she’s a woman they leave her alone. However, when she came out of the stall at Buffalo Wild Wings and told the server, “I am a lady,” she said the server responded, “You have to get out now,” according to a statement shared by Gender Justice. Google maps Gender Justice filed the charge of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, arguing that what happened to Mudra violates the state’s Human Rights Act, which protects people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, among other protected classes. Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, said at a news conference Tuesday that even though Mudra is not trans, the server’s actions “were based on assumptions that she made about” Mudra, and Minnesota’s law protects against discrimination based on stereotypes or assumptions about protected characteristics like gender identity. “When that doesn’t happen, the business is liable for the harm caused.” Gender Justice said Mudra’s experience “reflects a broader climate of fear and suspicion aimed at anyone who doesn’t conform to narrow expectations of what girls and women ‘should’ look like.” That suspicion has been driven largely by the wave of state legislation targeting trans people, particularly their access to school sports and bathrooms that align with their gender identities, though Minnesota has not enacted any such legislation. Nineteen states have laws that prohibit trans people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities in K-12 schools, and in many of those states the restrictions apply to other government-owned buildings as well, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. That’s the terrifying reality too many trans people live with every day.” Even if Mudra had been trans, she would be able to file a discrimination complaint under state law in Minnesota, which is one of 21 states and Washington, D.C., that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations, according to the Movement Advancement Project.

Article: WASHINGTON — Over the weekend, President Donald Trump urged homeless people living in Washington, D.C., to move out “IMMEDIATELY” and claimed “we will give you places to stay" that are "FAR" from the nation's capital. On Monday, he announced that he was federalizing Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard, saying the federal government will be “removing homeless encampments from all over our parks” in order to “rescue" Washington "from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” There were “many places” homeless people could go, Trump continued. Park Police will begin enforcing “pre-existing laws that are already on the books” to clear encampments as the president seeks to crack down on crime and “clean up” the nation’s capital. Advocates for homeless people in Washington told NBC News that they have not yet heard of any widespread action against people living on the streets, but they are bracing themselves for Tuesday night. What if they are not mentally ill or drug addicted but just poor and they live here?” According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness is at an all-time high across the United States. The majority of those people already stay in emergency shelters, according to the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, while nearly 800 people live unsheltered on the streets on any given night in Washington. Leavitt said that there are only two remaining homeless encampments in federal parks in Washington that are under the jurisdiction of the Park Police, adding that 70 encampments had been removed since Trump signed an executive order in March directing Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to direct the National Park Service to remove homeless encampments. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that she hadn’t been briefed on the plan for homeless people but planned to follow up with Attorney General Pam Bondi, whom she met with on Tuesday. official added, stressing that the mayor has said she wants homelessness to be “brief, rare and non-reoccurring.” Wassenich compared clearing encampments to “a game of whack-a-mole.” “You can’t be here, so they move somewhere else,” he said.

Article: The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it would begin a wide-ranging review of current and planned exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution, scouring wall text, websites and social media “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.” White House officials announced the review in a letter sent to Lonnie G. Museums will be required to adjust any content that the administration finds problematic within 120 days, the letter said, “replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate and constructive descriptions.” The review, which will begin with eight of the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, is the latest attempt by President Trump to try to impose his will on the Smithsonian, which is governed by a Board of Regents that includes a mixture of Democrats and Republicans and is overseen by Congress. The White House said in its letter that its review “aims to ensure alignment with the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” The letter adds that the “goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America’s heritage.”

Article: Pirro was back on Fox News with her former colleague Sean Hannity — he introduced her as a “friend of the program” — echoing the same calls for law and order she had made earlier that day and, for years before that, as a co-host of Fox News’s “The Five.” Right-wing media has embraced Mr. Trump’s crackdown in Washington, dismissing Democrats’ concerns about creeping authoritarianism and any exaggerations about the level of crime in the nation’s capital (Washington’s violent crime rate fell sharply last year, though it remains higher than that of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.) MAGA influencers like Charlie Kirk have called for a “full military occupation” of other major cities. Pirro’s return to her old network home was a small illustration of Fox News’s feedback loop with the second Trump administration, which, like its predecessors in both parties, regularly cites media coverage that validates and amplifies its policy goals.

Economists will, and should, point out that CPI inflation remains sticky and well above the Fed's 2% target, but markets, politics and Fed rhetoric are forcing a view that rates have room to fall to make them "less restrictive." The market sees CPI as the last known potential catalyst that could have truly upended the bullish case until Labor Day, even though we'll get retail sales, some consumer earnings and a lot of Fed rhetoric in coming weeks.

Your money in a high-yield savings account is federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which means that deposits up to $250,000 are protected if the bank were to suddenly collapse. Common high-yield terms you should know ACH transfer: When you want to make small and frequent payments electronically (direct deposit, automated bill payments, etc.); typically always free but usually takes at least one business day to complete the transfer. When you make a transaction at an ATM that is outside your bank's network, then a fee will most likely be applied by both the ATM operator and your bank. Mobile deposit: Instead of going to the bank to deposit a check, you can use your mobile banking app to scan a photo of the check and have the funds immediately deposited into your account. Wire transfer: When you want to move funds from one bank account to another and have the money available for use on the same business day; banks usually charge a fee. Pros and cons of having a high-yield savings account Pros of a high-yield savings account Above-average APYs FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per account Funds are accessible up to a limit usually Some accounts offer ATM cards for savers Easy to find an account with zero monthly fees and zero, or low, minimum requirements Most accounts are online and easy to manage on the go with mobile banking apps Easy to transfer money between other bank accounts Good vehicle for emergency savings or a short-term savings goal Cons of a high-yield savings account APYs are variable and can change at any time Some banks impose monthly withdrawal or transfer limits Not all accounts offer ATM cards Since most accounts are online, there are limited to no in-person banking options available While you can transfer your funds from one bank to another, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours Not a good way to grow your wealth long-term since inflation can outpace the interest you earn over time FAQs What is the difference between a high-yield savings account and a traditional savings account?

Article: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez warned staffers about the dangers of misinformation during an agencywide meeting, the first since last week’s shooting at CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta that left one police officer dead, according to a transcript of her remarks obtained by NBC News. Monarez conducted Tuesday’s staff meeting virtually, joined by Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jeff Williams, director of the CDC’s Office of Safety, Security and Asset Management, in an effort to reassure the people who work at the Atlanta campus about their safety. We need to rebuild the trust together.” Monarez said the agency can rebuild that trust with “rational, evidence-based discourse” communicated with ”compassion and understanding.” The suspected shooter, Patrick White, 30, fired close to 200 rounds that struck six buildings at the CDC’s campus, law enforcement officials said at a separate press conference Tuesday. She said that as staffers return to campus in the coming weeks, it will be “different” and “unsettling, in many ways, for some time to come.” White's motive remains under investigation, although officials said they found documents at his home in Kennesaw, Georgia, expressing his discontent with the Covid vaccines. When asked if Kennedy planned to address vaccine misinformation, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said Monarez and CDC leadership “remain focused on supporting staff during an extraordinarily difficult time as evidenced by their continued direct engagement.” “This is a time to stand in solidarity with our public health workforce and we hope the media will respect the moment rather than exploiting a tragedy and further exacerbating an already harrowing experience by the dedicated CDC staff,” Nixon said in the statement to NBC News. In a statement released Tuesday, Joseph Kanter, the CEO of The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a group that represents state public health agencies, said “in this time of heated rhetoric and polarization, we implore everyone to help dampen inflammatory slander undeservingly aimed at public health professionals.” On Monday, Kennedy visited CDC’s headquarters, where security led him through campus, pointing out shattered windows across multiple buildings, according to statement released by HHS. The HHS statement also said the agency "continues to support CDC personnel and their families.” Over the weekend, Kennedy sent an email to staff, saying the agency is “standing together” in the wake of the shooting. The same year, he described the Covid shot as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” He has also taken steps the limit use of the updated Covid vaccines for the fall, restricting its use to older adults and those with underlying health conditions.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. Sherrod Brown plans to launch a comeback bid for Senate in Ohio, a major recruiting win for Democrats who need to catch every break they can in their uphill fight for the majority in the chamber. Brown is viewed by Democrats as one of the few, if not the only, members of their party who could put the seat in the red-trending state in play next year. Democrats feel even better about the chances Cooper — who has won several statewide contests — has in a state Trump carried more narrowly (3 points) in 2024, particularly with incumbent Republican Thom Tillis declining to seek another term. A tough map: Even if Democrats manage to flip North Carolina and Maine, while holding battlegrounds like Georgia and Michigan, they’d still need to win two other Republican-held seats to take control of the Senate. There’s a growing Democratic field in the Hawkeye State: Josh Turek, a state lawmaker and former Paralympian with two gold medals, is the latest entrant in the race for GOP Sen. Our own NBC News poll spotted this trend early this year and recent surveys show it persisting, including one from CNBC last week that found that just 22% of Americans have a positive perception of the Democratic Party, compared to 55% negative. This indicates that hostility to President Donald Trump and the GOP remains the central motivating force for Democratic voters, more than enough to override any qualms they have about their own side. As Trump’s second terms began, our NBC News poll found that 65% of Democrats wanted their party to dig in and oppose Trump instead of seeking compromise — a reversal from the start of Trump’s first term.

The octagon cage fight event was announced by UFC boss Dana White, whose friendship with the president dates back to the early 2000s when Trump hosted some of the first ever UFC events at his business properties. "So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings." Trump had teased the idea of hosting a fight at the White House during an event last month in Iowa. He indicated that there were ideas to build a cage for the fight on the grounds of the White House and suggested the event could host up to 25,000 people. "We're going to have a UFC fight, think of this, on the grounds of the White House," Trump said at a 4 July Salute to America event in the state.

The Phoenix, beaten in both of their first two fixtures, needed 61 runs from 24 balls with six wickets left before captain Livingstone struck five balls from superstar Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid for 26 runs, with three sixes and two fours. Then, with three to defend from the last five, Saqib Mahmood took two wickets in two balls but Benny Howell drove a four and Livingstone finished 69 not out from 27 - Phoenix completing the third-highest chase in The Hundred with four wickets and two balls to spare. There was needle between the sides throughout the contest, with Curran appearing to celebrate in the direction of Livingstone after he dismissed Jacob Bethell for eight, at which stage Livingstone had 16. "He is one of my good friends and he called me a fat slob or something so I thought 'let's hope you don't go for a few if you come back at the death' and he did so I'm kind of happy with that." Rashid's final figures - 0-59 from 20 balls - are the most expensive in the tournament as the Invincibles' winning start to the tournament ended.

Article: Trump official tells census workers Congress has final say over the count, not Trump toggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Less than a week after President Trump said he has ordered a "new" census," the cabinet official who oversees the Census Bureau acknowledged Tuesday that Congress, not the president, has final say over the national head count that's used to reshape election maps and guide federal funding, NPR has exclusively learned. Speaking at a town-hall event for the bureau's employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that when tallying the country's population, the census should differentiate people living in the U.S. Sponsor Message Lutnick said if a person has "broken into the country," they need to be counted in the census, but they should be counted as someone who has "broken into the country," the three employees confirmed to NPR. Lutnick's remarks come amid a Republican-led campaign to use census data to redraw congressional voting maps in Texas and other states ahead of next year's midterm election in an attempt to maintain GOP control of the House of Representatives. Ron DeSantis and some GOP lawmakers in Congress have floated conducting a census before the next scheduled count in 2030 so that new results can be used to redistribute House seats among the states and redraw maps of congressional voting districts — all before the 2026 election. Lutnick's comments on Tuesday mark the first known acknowledgement by a top Trump administration official of the potential legal hurdles facing any attempt to carry out the president's census call. The 14th Amendment requires the "whole number of persons in each state" to be counted in the 2030 census apportionment numbers, which are set to be used to determine each state's new share of House seats and Electoral College votes. Brian Schatz of Hawaii: "Since the first sentence of the 14th Amendment of that clause says we will count each whole person, I promise you we will count each whole person. citizens to be counted" in the census, Lutnick said: "Consistency makes sense." Some Republicans are still pushing for a census before the 2026 midterms Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to carry out a national tally "in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." In Title 13 of the U.S. That federal law also allows for a mid-decade census in 2025, but it can't be used to redistribute House seats and a legal deadline to prepare for such a count has already passed. Still, Trump said in the social media post that he instructed the Commerce Department to "immediately begin work" on a "new" census that excludes people living in the states without legal status. Sponsor Message Hours after Trump's census call, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the Census Bureau "will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data" and "accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States." The department replied with that same statement when asked by NPR on Tuesday whether Lutnick has communicated to the White House his position on Congress' authority over the census and whether the commerce secretary plans to propose adding a census question about a person's immigration status, which the bureau has yet to test. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to change current federal law and allow for a new census, redistribution of House seats and a new round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election. Florida's state Attorney General James Uthmeier — a former Trump administration official who helped come up with a failed plan to exclude people without legal status from the 2020 census apportionment numbers — made two proposals. Uthmeier suggested states get new shares of House seats before the 2026 midterm election based on a census "recount" in areas of states that the Census Bureau estimates it over- or undercounted in 2020. Sponsor Message "We are energized by President Trump's leadership," Uthmeier wrote, "and we look forward to hearing from you and working together to resolve these issues." Edited by Megan Pratz

Article: A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to swiftly remedy conditions inside migrant holding cells in New York City where detainees have complained of squalid and overcrowded conditions. Kaplan, ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to hold fewer people in the 10th-floor holding cells of the agency’s Lower Manhattan offices at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE has been accused of detaining dozens of migrants for days or weeks in tight quarters meant to hold detainees for just a few hours. The judge also ordered ICE to allow migrants to place calls to their lawyers and to ensure that they have access to proper medical and hygienic care following allegations that detainees were deprived of showers, given meager meals and forced to sleep on the concrete floor without any bedding. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday by legal organizations representing a Peruvian immigrant, Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was arrested by ICE and held at 26 Federal Plaza last week.

Article: Black civil rights leaders and the mayors of several cities on Tuesday denounced the deployment of the National Guard to the nation’s capital to combat crime, calling it “fundamentally grandstanding” and “a federal coup.” And by suggesting that other cities, also run by Black mayors, may be next, President Donald Trump was “playing the worst game of racially divisive politics,” one rights leader said. “And we will bring in the military if it’s needed.” Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said the president’s actions and words were racially polarizing, considering crime rates in these cities are largely declining. “This is a distraction at a time when these cities deserve credit because crime and violence are down in most American cities right now, and this is trying to distract from that success, and in effect, create a de facto police state in these cities,” Morial told NBC News. ‒ especially those living on the streets, who need the most care ‒ will suffer, alongside the core principles of our Democracy.” And NAACP president Derrick Johnson questioned the declaration of an emergency in D.C., calling it a “federal coup.” The White House responded to the criticisms in a statement to NBC News: “There is nothing divisive about cracking down on crime in our nation’s capital to make it safer and more beautiful for all residents and visitors from all around the world,” said White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers. This is why Democrats continue to be so unpopular among everyday Americans — they think the President of the United States cracking down on crime in our nation’s capital is a bad thing.” Trump federalized the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department over the weekend and called the nation’s capital “one of the most dangerous cities in the world.” It followed the fatal shooting of a congressional intern in July and the carjacking of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer in D.C. Black Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in their lifetimes than white Americans, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump’s move, which he had hinted at for months, is “unsettling and unprecedented.” The administration forced the removal of the Black Lives Matter street painting that had been prominent in the city since 2020 by threatening to hold back millions in funding if it remained. “What the White House should be doing is restoring the SNAP cuts and restoring the Medicaid cuts, which are going to do damage to Washington, D.C., and other urban communities,” Morial said. “When it comes to public safety in Baltimore, he should turn off the right-wing propaganda and look at the facts.” Homicides are down 28% in Baltimore this year alone, reaching the lowest level of any year on record, with overall crime rates lower than it’s been in more than 50 years. “We still have real work to do to build on this progress—but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.” And as Scott pointed out, “it’s not just Baltimore.” In Chicago, violent crime also is down by more than 30% and shootings almost 40%. Mayor Brandon Johnson said the dramatic reductions occurred even as Trump cut “$158 million in funding for violence prevention programs in cities like Chicago,” as well as Los Angeles, New York, D.C. “If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,” Johnson said. “may not be the most productive approach, especially when local leaders and law enforcement are already making significant strides in reducing crime and improving community trust.” Johnson implored the Trump administration to work with mayors and to “support solutions that strengthen law enforcement partnerships and community engagement.” Republicans backed Trump’s move.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about the possibility of resettling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the war-torn East African country, part of a wider effort by Israel to facilitate mass emigration from the territory left in ruins by its 22-month offensive against Hamas. “I think that the right thing to do, even according to the laws of war as I know them, is to allow the population to leave, and then you go in with all your might against the enemy who remains there,” Netanyahu said Tuesday in an interview with i24, and Israeli TV station.

The State Department, asked if there was any quid pro quo with South Sudan, said decisions on the issuing of visas are made “in a way that prioritizes upholding the highest standards for U.S. national security, public safety, and the enforcement of our immigration laws.” From one hunger-stricken conflict zone to another Many Palestinians might want to leave Gaza, at least temporarily, to escape the war and a hunger crisis bordering on famine. They fear that Israel will never allow them to return, and that a mass departure would allow it to annex Gaza and reestablish Jewish settlements there, as called for by far-right ministers in the Israeli government. The oil-rich country is plagued by corruption and relies on international aid to help feed its 11 million people – a challenge that has only grown since the Trump administration made sweeping cuts to foreign assistance. Yakani, of the civil society group, said South Sudanese would need to know who is coming and how long they plan to stay, or there could be hostilities due to the “historical issues with Muslims and Arabs.” “South Sudan should not become a dumping ground for people,” he said.

Starbuck is known for supporting Donald Trump’s 2020 election denialism, for promoting anti-trans and anti-diversity misinformation, and for using his social media accounts to crusade against companies that support diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

Article: On Monday, Trump announced that he was extending the trade truce between the United States and China, just hours before a new tariff hike was set to go into effect. Shortly after Trump’s eleventh-hour announcement, “The Weeknight” co-host Symone Sanders Townsend blasted the president for his reversal: “Donald Trump folded.” She said the extension is more proof that the administration is failing to reach a “consensus on trade deals” across the board. While the president has touted various frameworks of deals, Sanders Townsend said those agreements are not final or concrete: “Let’s just be very clear: The fact that he’s doing trade deals is a lie. These are not trade deals.” Co-host Alicia Menendez added that such lies have consequences, saying that one of the “most important” elements at play is the “uncertainty that he is absolutely dedicated to infusing into the economy.” “The on-again, off-again, the fact that the deadlines are [coming],” she continued. He is arbitrarily deciding on these deadlines, announcing these deadlines; there are no proof points that it has actually helped him to move these negotiations along.” Menendez went on to quote an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal, which compared Trump’s efforts to exert political control over the U.S. “It is more like state capitalism, a hybrid between socialism and capitalism in which the state guides the decisions of nominally private enterprises.” “This is the point right here,” Sanders Townsend interjected, adding: “If we really pull the layers back, we need to ask: Is it the government that has a stake, or is it a private entity somewhere that somehow Donald Trump or his treasury secretary has his tentacles in? So I just think people should continue to ask more questions.” You can watch the remarks by Sanders Townsend and Menendez in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: White House to conduct review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions to ensure they fit with Trump's view of American history The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is seen from the Washington Monument, June 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The White House plans to conduct a wide-ranging review of the Smithsonian Institution's museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America's 250th anniversary next year to ensure the museums align with President Donald Trump's view of American history, a White House official confirmed to ABC News. In a letter sent to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the White House writes that it wants to ensure that the museums "reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story." The White House writes that in accordance with a March executive order, "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," officials will be leading a "comprehensive internal review of selected Smithsonian museums and exhibitions. This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions." The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is seen from the Washington Monument, June 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Kevin Carter/Getty Images The review will focus on several key areas, including examining public-facing content, such as exhibition texts, websites and social media "to assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals." In addition, the review will examine the curatorial process, current and future exhibitions, how existing materials and collections are used and the development of "consistent curatorial guidelines that reflect the Smithsonian's original mission." For now, the review will focus on eight Smithsonian museums: The National Museum of American History The National Museum of Natural History The National Museum of African American History and Culture The National Museum of the American Indian The National Air and Space Museum The Smithsonian American Art Museum The National Portrait Gallery The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden In a statement, the Smithsonian Institution said: "The Smithsonian's work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents."

Article: Real Madrid has said that it “firmly rejects” having a regular-season Spanish league game played in the United States and warned of “a turning point in the world of football”. Villarreal, in contrast, is promising free travel and tickets for season-ticket holders if its match against Barcelona in Miami is approved, in what would be a first for the league. Madrid said on Tuesday that it has taken action to keep the December 20 match from happening in the US, claiming it would hurt the “integrity of the competition” and the “legitimacy of the results”. “The measure, which was taken without prior information or consultation of the clubs participating in the competition, infringes the essential principle of territorial reciprocity, which applies in two-legged league competitions (one match at home and the other at the home of the opposing team), upsetting the competitive balance and giving an undue sporting advantage to the applicant clubs,” Madrid said. The Europe-wide fan group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) said it was “liaising” with members, soccer stakeholders, affected groups and partner organisations to “collectively resist the latest threat to the very nature of football”. “Moving games from their domestic territories strikes at the heart of the relationship between fans and their teams, breaking vital links between clubs and their communities.” The group also criticised a similar move by the Italian league to play a match abroad. The Italian football federation said in July that a plan was in motion to play the Serie A match between AC Milan and Como in the Australian city of Perth in February. Madrid asks FIFA and UEFA to withhold permission for Barcelona game Madrid said it has asked FIFA, UEFA and Spain’s top sport body to not authorise the game in the US. “Any modification of this nature must, in any case, have the express and unanimous agreement of all the clubs participating in the competition, as well as strictly respecting the national and international rules governing the organization of official competitions,” Madrid said. The club said UEFA should deny the request to play the game abroad, based on the “criterion established in 2018 that prevents official matches in domestic competitions from being played outside national territory, except in duly justified exceptional circumstances, which are not present here”. “Real Madrid reaffirms its commitment to respect the national and international rules that guarantee the fairness and proper functioning of official competitions, and will defend its compliance with them before all competent bodies,” the club said. “It would greatly help us expand our brand in a key market like the United States.” Staging a match abroad has long been part of the league’s goal to promote football and its brand in other countries. Advertisement It first tried to stage a match in the US in 2018, with a game between Barcelona and Girona, but the idea was dismissed after criticism from players, fans and clubs. The attempts to play in the US are part of the league’s long-term partnership with sport and entertainment group Relevent Sports, which is part of Stephen Ross’s portfolio of companies, including Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins, the Formula One’s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament. Earlier this year, it was announced that New York-based Relevent Sports has exclusive negotiating rights over the global commercial rights to the UEFA men’s club competitions for the period 2027-2033.

Article: The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and other agencies also held meetings with Baidu and smaller Chinese tech firms in recent weeks, said one of the two people and a third source. Authorities in China expressed concern that the materials Nvidia has asked companies to submit for review with the US government could contain sensitive information, including client data, one of the sources said. Advertisement Several companies were issued official notices discouraging the use of the H20, a lower-end chip, mainly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. In a separate report, The Information reported that ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent had been ordered by the CAC in the past two weeks to suspend Nvidia chip purchases altogether, citing data security concerns. The CAC directive was communicated at a meeting the regulator held with more than a dozen Chinese tech firms, shortly after the administration of United States President Donald Trump reversed the export curbs on H20 chips, according to the Information report. But even without an outright ban, the concerns expressed by Chinese authorities could threaten Nvidia’s recently restored access to the Chinese market as Chinese companies look to keep in step with regulators. Threat to revenue stream Last month, China’s cyberspace regulator summoned Nvidia representatives, asking the company to explain whether the H20 posed backdoor security risks that could affect Chinese user data and privacy. China has accelerated work on domestic AI chip alternatives, with companies such as Huawei developing processors that rival the H20’s performance, and Beijing urging the technology sector to become more self-sufficient. Advertisement On Monday, US President Donald Trump suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China, despite deep-seated fears in Washington that Beijing could harness US AI capabilities to supercharge its military. The Trump administration last week confirmed an unprecedented deal with Nvidia and AMD, which agreed to give the US government 15 percent of revenue from sales of some advanced chips in China.

Article: DALLAS — Congresswoman Julie Johnson (D-Dallas) sent a letter to Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux demanding specifics on the department's interactions with federal immigration authorities, as frustration from members of the community and the city's police oversight board mounts. The Community Police Oversight Board was set to vote Tuesday on next steps after a response to a short response from Comeaux after the City Attorney's office prevented him from answering specific questions on immigration at a contentious June meeting. The number of public comment speakers at last Wednesday's City Council meeting with questions about immigration led City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert to issue a memo stating the city is committed to following "all relevant laws and regulations regarding immigration." "Dallas’ strength is the rich tapestry of our communities," Tolbert wrote. The federal government is primarily responsible for enforcing immigration laws." Comeaux has previously said that the department's policy has not changed and DPD will assist legal requests from federal partners, including ICE. Are they providing security?" He described the experience of trying to get answers from the department as "frustrating." "A lot of people in our community are very uncomfortable, and I don’t think we're going to let this stand. "People are not afraid of DPD, they’re afraid of what’s going on in our country." He said he feels the department has handled immigration well and said the chief has answered questions "diplomatically" but to his satisfaction.

Article: ATLANTA (AP) — Human rights scandals have marred World Cup tournaments for years, but FIFA is testing a new protocol requiring all host committees to develop action plans to protect human rights for the 2026 games in North America. It’s not self-executing,” said Jennifer Li, director of the O’Neill Institute’s Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law and national coordinator of the Dignity 2026 Coalition, which is working with FIFA on human rights. A FIFA spokesperson said the governing body has been working closely with host cities and counties, which they say are on track to develop final action plans by the Aug. Human rights concerns in North America look different from those in other countries where FIFA has come under fire, which had few protections for workers and massive stadium and transportation construction projects. Migrant workers labored in Qatar’s scorching heat for more than a decade before the 2022 World Cup there, and human rights advocates worry migrant workers’ lives are again at risk in Saudi Arabia, which will host the games in 2034. “The host communities are quite invested in their legacy, so they’ve stepped up,” said labor rights expert Deborah Greenfield, who is in an expert advisory group supporting FIFA’s human rights work for 2026. READ MORE: What the Trump travel ban means for the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games Protesters in Miami-Dade County gathered outside FIFA’s offices in June to demand that the governing body protect travelers and workers and speak out against Trump’s immigration moves. That came after a Club World Cup event hosted in the area by Spanish-language TV network Telemundo was canceled after an unexpected Coast Guard inspection involving at least one Border Patrol agent, local outlets reported. What tends to happen is everybody gets their bag and then they turn a blind eye to making sure people are getting paid properly or not being harassed.” Miami-Dade officials referred The Associated Press to the local host committee, which did not respond to requests for comment. More than 9,000 unhoused people were arrested when Atlanta prepared to host the Olympics in 1996, and a plan to eliminate homelessness downtown before the World Cup worries advocates that unhoused people will be jailed again. READ MORE: Brazil to host 2027 Women’s World Cup, a first for South America Atlanta officials and partners say the Downtown Rising plan is a part of the mayor’s larger investments in reducing homelessness and building affordable housing. Cities with impending sporting events have ramped up enforcement, including San Jose, where unhoused people who reject three offers of shelter will now be eligible for arrest on trespassing charges. It’s not about human rights in any meaningful way.” Working to address standards FIFA’s human rights policy published in 2017 mandates bidders for the men’s 2026 World Cup to respect “international human rights and labor standards according to the United Nations’ guiding principles.” A group of international lawyers filed a formal complaint to FIFA in May claiming the soccer body is failing to uphold its human rights policy with 2034 World Cup host Saudi Arabia. In North America, Greenfield said FIFA is taking the goal of having a tournament “that respects and promotes human rights” seriously and she wouldn’t be participating in the effort if she didn’t think that was possible. Candace Stanciel, Atlanta’s chief equity officer, said the city was committed to human rights work before FIFA came in and launched efforts to combat human trafficking in airports, hotels and public transport. The International Labour Organization called FIFA’s human rights framework “an important step forward in harnessing the power of sport to advance decent work globally,” adding that it aligns with international labor standards.

After Border Patrol agents last week sprang from a Penske moving truck and snatched up workers at a Westlake Home Depot — appearing to openly defy the court’s order — some attorneys warned the rule of law is crumbling in plain sight. “Somewhere there are Founding Fathers who are turning over in their graves.” Advertisement The chaotic immigration arrests that swept through Los Angeles this summer had all but ceased following the original July 11 order, which bars agents from snatching people off the streets without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. For the punch-drunk Department of Justice, the 9th Circuit loss was the latest blow in a protracted judicial beatdown, as many of the administration’s most aggressive moves have been held back by federal judges and tied up in appellate courts. In the last two weeks alone, the 9th Circuit also found Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional and signaled it would likely rule in favor of a group of University of California researchers hoping to claw back funding from Trump’s war on so-called DEI policies. (FOX News/Matt Finn via AP) The Department of Justice argues that the same power that allows the president to federalize troops and deploy them on American streets also creates a “Constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law that bars the soldiers from civilian police action. Even if they keep taking losses, Trump administration officials “don’t have much to lose” by picking fights, said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University and a Constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute. “There’s no indication to me that [Department of Homeland Security agents] are changing their behavior.” Some scholars speculated the lower court bloodbath might actually be a strategic sacrifice in the war to extend presidential power in the Supreme Court. “They are losing cases right and left in the district court, but consistently having district court orders stayed in the Supreme Court.” Advertisement Win or lose in the lower courts, the political allure of targeting California is potent, argued Segall, the law professor who studies the Supreme Court. “I don’t think martial law is off the table.” Pedro Vásquez Perdomo, a day laborer who is one of the plaintiffs on the Southern California case challenging racial profiling by immigration enforcement, has said the case is bigger than him. 4, his voice trembling as he spoke about the temporary restraining order — upheld days earlier by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — that stood between his fellow Angelenos and unchecked federal authority.

Article: -- Government-run medical centers serving the nation's veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs — out of 484,000 — through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers. Pete Kasperowicz, the VA's press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore “not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.” “The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,” Kasperowicz wrote. He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with “normal VA historical averages.” But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration's profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA. They’ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.” Simon also noted the VA’s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment. The VA said in a news release that the move will “make it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America’s Veterans.” But U.S. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs “and ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they’ve earned.” “We also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting," said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia.

Article: The United States has sanctioned an armed group accused of illicit mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as both the army and the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group traded accusations of violating a recently reached US-mediated ceasefire deal by attacking each other’s positions. The US Department of the Treasury said on Tuesday that it was blocking all interests and restricting transactions with Pareco-FF, an armed group that it said controlled the key coltan mining site of Rubaya from 2022 to 2024, and which has opposed the M23 group. It also slapped sanctions on the Congolese mining company CDMC, saying it sold minerals that were sourced and smuggled from mines near Rubaya and two Hong Kong-based export companies, East Rise and Star Dragon, which have been accused of buying minerals from the armed group. “The United States is sending a clear message that no armed group or commercial entity is immune from sanctions if they undermine peace, stability or security in the DRC,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Advertisement The sanctions come as Congolese army spokesman Sylvain Ekenge said in a statement that the M23 group’s “almost daily” attacks constitute an “intentional and manifest violation” of the declaration of principles, which the two parties signed in mid-July in Doha, whose terms include a “permanent ceasefire”. It followed a separate peace deal between the Congolese and Rwandan governments, signed in Washington, DC, the previous month, which also helped the US government and US companies gain control of critical minerals in the region. A new surge of unrest broke out early this year when the M23 group captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, setting up their own administrations, with thousands killed in the conflict. Violence has continued on the ground despite the US and Qatar-brokered peace deal, with fighting becoming more intense since Friday around the town of Mulamba in South Kivu province, where the front line had been relatively stable since March. The M23 attacked positions between Friday and Monday held by pro-Kinshasa militia and army forces, and pushed them back several kilometres, after clashes using light and heavy weapons, local and security sources said.

Article: County prosecutors plan to file additional corruption charges this week against City Councilman Curren Price, who is already facing multiple counts of grand theft and perjury for allegedly voting in favor of projects his wife had a financial interest in, multiple sources told The Times. The charges were expected to be made public Thursday during a pretrial hearing in downtown L.A., according to three people with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about an ongoing criminal case. Prosecutors said Price’s wife — Del Richardson, founder of the consulting company Del Richardson & Associates — received “payments totaling more than $150,000 between 2019 and 2021 from developers before [Price] voted to approve projects.” Advertisement The perjury charges stem from a claim that Price didn’t list his wife’s income on disclosure forms. Prosecutors also accused Price of theft by embezzlement for bilking the city out of tens of thousands of dollars by placing Richardson on his city-issued healthcare plan between 2013 and 2017, before they were legally married. Price’s attorney, Michael Schafler, called the new charges “nothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.” “They have gone back as much as 6 years, combing through thousands and thousands of votes, to find a couple more allegedly conflicted votes, hoping that the public will overlook the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that Councilmember Price was aware of the alleged conflicts when he voted for the agenda items,” Schafler said in a statement. Advertisement The original criminal complaint was filed roughly four years after a Times investigation found Price had repeatedly cast votes that affected housing developers and other firms listed as clients of his wife’s consulting company. Advertisement In an October 2023 motion seeking to dismiss the charges, Price’s legal team argued prosecutors failed to show the payments to Richardson had any influence on the councilman’s votes. Many of the votes described in the criminal complaint were also approved by an overwhelming majority of the council, meaning Price did not swing any one decision that could financially benefit Richardson. Schafler also argued the embezzlement charges are invalid because Price did not have control over the funds used to pay for Richardson’s healthcare, which is a required element of the crime under California law.

Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritizes getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favor Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15%. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS Commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. They don’t organize it.” Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen.

Article: — Government-run medical centers serving the nation's veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs — out of 484,000 — through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers. Pete Kasperowicz, the VA's press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore “not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.” “The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,” Kasperowicz wrote. He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with “normal VA historical averages.” But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration's profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA. They’ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.” Simon also noted the VA’s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment. The VA said in a news release that the move will “make it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America’s Veterans.” But U.S. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs “and ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they’ve earned.” “We also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting," said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia.

Article: 12 minutes ago Share Save Theo Leggett International Business Correspondent Share Save BBC A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs. Daily Herald/Mirrorpix via Getty Images Vauxhall's Luton plant has been building cars since 1905 until production stopped earlier this year In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953. Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale. "You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on." And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges. "Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy." He is concerned about what has already been lost. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers. Adam Vaughan/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images One of the UK's leading manufacturers, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has deliberately moved upmarket in recent years, meaning it now sells fewer cars - also contributing to the lower figure of UK car production "Obviously, Brexit had a big impact", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. "It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility." As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles. Reuters/ Chris Radburn 'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry. "Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production," explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics. The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency. The investments starting to bear fruit When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year. A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production. "The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers." Toby Melville/PA Wire Just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025 Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit. "The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive." Yang Dong/VCG via Getty Images Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market. "If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry," argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies. Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images The UK is home to a number of luxury car firms, such as Bentley "I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in," says the executive, who asked not to be named. "It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand." Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars. "Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go." This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry. Bloomberg via Getty Images ‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’ Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. "[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else."

Article: Police get new guidance on releasing suspects' ethnicity It comes after a series of high-profile cases including that of two men, reported to be Afghan asylum seekers, charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire. Welcoming the new guidance, a Home Office spokesperson said: "Public trust requires transparency and consistency from the authorities that serve them." What are the rules around police giving out a suspect's nationality? As it stands, there is nothing in the College of Policing's guidance on media relations that prevents police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even ethnicity of someone who has been charged. In May, when a car ploughed into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's winning of the Premiership title, Merseyside Police were quick to reveal that the man arrested was white and British, in order to quash rumours of a terrorist attack in the public interest. Conversely, the forces decision not to release information about Axel Rudakubana - the man jailed for murdering Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, in Southport last summer - allowed false information to spread. Referring to the riots, Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya, the NPCC lead for communications and media, described it as the "real-world consequences" of the information the police release into the public domain. He said: "We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels." He added that "being as fair, consistent and transparent as we can will improve confidence in policing". Chief Constable Sir Andy Marsh, CEO at the College of Policing, added that the interim guidance would "bring consistency" and that "information can be released for all ethnicities and nationalities when it meets the right criteria." The guidance has been developed following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Home Office and the College of Policing will update its current authorised professional practice for media relations later this year. The Home Office spokesperson added: "The public, and police forces themselves, want greater clarity on when, why and how information is released and the legitimate and compelling reasons it may need to be withheld. "The Home Office will support that effort by authorising the release of relevant accompanying immigration information in future cases, where it is appropriate to do so, and where the police have requested it. "The government also asked the Law Commission at the end of February to speed up the elements of its review around the law of contempt in relation to what can be said publicly ahead of a trial."

Geoff Bennett: On that point, at a press conference this morning, the Georgia Bureau of Investigations at a search of the shooter’s home turned up documents expressing what they described as discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations. We have seen a rise in that violent rhetoric online over the past few years, but that coupling of I am in pain and suffering to I must take that out on individuals who are working in health-related fields, that is relatively new and quite scary and I think reflected in the shooting. Having those gestures after things like — if I go back to something like 9/11, right, which was a terrorist attack, and, in many ways, this was a terrorist attack, those gestures, those symbolic acts do make a difference, understanding that just because only one person died it does not mean that this was not a severe attack with severe consequences both in the short and long term for the psychological well-being of people that work in this field, as well as potentially for their physical health. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention the CDC started promoting a fund-raiser to help the family of the officer who was killed in the line of duty, DeKalb County Officer David Rose.

Article: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a 2021 Arkansas law banning gender-affirming care for minors, ruling that parents “do not have unlimited authority to make medical decisions for their children.” The St. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled 8-2 that the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act does not discriminate against transgender people or violate the rights of medical professionals — rejecting a closely watched challenge to the nation’s first-of-its-kind ban on gender transition treatment for transgender youth. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The SAFE Act also prohibits doctors from referring trans youth to other providers for gender-affirming care, which can include puberty blockers and hormone therapy, among other treatments. “I applaud the court’s decision recognizing that Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological health of children and am pleased that children in Arkansas will be protected from risky, experimental procedures with lifelong consequences,” Griffin said in a statement. Advertisement The American Civil Liberties Association — which brought the original challenge to the 2021 law alongside a doctor who provided gender-affirming care in the state and four transgender youths and their families — slammed the ruling. Advertisement Advertisement “This is a tragically unjust result for transgender Arkansans, their doctors, and their families,” Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a statement Tuesday. The law has already had a profound impact on families across Arkansas who all deserve a fundamental right to do what is best for their children.” Griffin and the state’s medical board filed the appeal with the 8th Circuit in July 2023, after U.S. Advertisement Moody had said the ban violated the rights of transgender people and endangered their health: “Rather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence showed that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of patients and that, by prohibiting it, the state undermined the interests it claims to be advancing.” Advertisement Advertisement The 8th Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed Moody’s ruling.

Article: Call for free bus passes to help under-22s into work 51 minutes ago Share Save Emer Moreau & Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News Share Save Getty Images Under-22s in England should be given free bus passes to help them get into work and education, according to a report by MPs. 'We rely on public transport' Alex Mustafa Alex Mustafa, 19, says she uses the bus all the time as she can't drive due to health and financial reasons and would benefit from a free bus pass. Roman Dibden, chief executive of youth charity Rise Up, said it sees young people turn down job interviews and training all the time because they can't afford the bus fare. "Free bus passes for under-22s would remove a huge barrier, opening up access to jobs, apprenticeships, and training - especially in communities where opportunity isn't on your doorstep." 'Support people who struggle costs-wise' Dylan Lewis-Creser Dylan Lewis-Creser, 21, is a student in town planning and also stood as a Green Party candidate for Walkley Ward in the local elections in May 2024. "A free bus pass would mean I could get to and from university and work without paying £10 a week, which adds up significantly as a student on a low budget," they said. "That cost is amplified when considering changing buses to get to other job opportunities and elsewhere, like hospitals." Dylan thinks there needs to be more discussion around "making transport accessible, affordable and reliable." "Part of that would be supporting people who often struggle costs-wise to do that, such as young people," they said. "We've seen how it's boosted young people using buses in Scotland, and it only makes sense to extend that policy." Bus passengers spend £39.1 billion in local businesses every year, according to research from KPMG. The report said: "The current deregulated nature of the bus sector can encourage commercial operators to "deprioritise" less profitable routes, often leaving vulnerable communities without a service." 'Social exclusion' The committee heard that older people were particularly deterred from using the bus if they felt unsafe at bus stops. "A lot of people, we're the only people they see every week." "They become friends with the other people on their route so it's a great tool for combatting loneliness," Ms Bishop said. Stop-start funding risks losing passengers, with patronage difficult to recover if and when money is found." Steff Aquarone, a Liberal Democrat MP who sits on the Transport Committee, said the report shows the need for "a different model for rural public transport".

Kim is also accused of receiving two Chanel bags together valued at 20 million won and a diamond necklace from a religious group as a bribe in return for influence favourable to its business interests. Kim's lawyers did not immediately comment on Tuesday but they have previously denied the accusations against her and dismissed as groundless speculation news reports about some of the gifts she allegedly received.

Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship".

"When we first got here, there were flames shooting 30 or 40 feet, unfortunately on our end of the building, and they had three of those fire trucks putting the big hoses of water down through the roof," Cast Theatrical Company president John Bevil recalled. "We're going to try through our economic development department to see if we can relocate some of these folks and do everything we can to help them," Rosenberg Mayor William Benton said.

Article: The deadly cancers left behind by 50 years of success 21 minutes ago Share Save Nick Triggle • @nicktriggle Health correspondent Share Save Getty Images The number of people surviving cancer has improved hugely in the past 50 years, but experts warn progress has been uneven with some of the cancers with the worst survival rates falling further behind. For some, including melanoma skin cancer, 10-year survival is now above 90%, while for all cancers, half of patients can expect to live that long - double the figure in the early 1970s. But a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said there had been little improvement in those affecting the oesophagus, stomach and lungs - and less than 5% survive pancreatic cancer for 10 years. Alongside pancreatic cancer, the study says these include oesophagus, stomach and lung cancers, which all still have 10-year survival rates below 20%, after only a small amount of progress since the 1970s.

Article: Government expands police use of facial recognition vans 32 minutes ago Share Save Share Save Home Office More live facial recognition (LFR) vans will be rolled out across seven police forces in England to locate suspects for crimes including sexual offences, violent assaults and homicides, the Home Office has announced. Rebecca Vincent, interim director of Big Brother Watch, said: "Police have interpreted the absence of any legislative basis authorising the use of this intrusive technology as carte blanche to continue to roll it out unfettered, despite the fact that a crucial judicial review on the matter is pending. "The Home Office must scrap its plans to roll out further live facial recognition capacity until robust legislative safeguards are established." Charlie Whelton, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: "It's welcome news that the government will finally develop a statutory framework on the use of facial recognition, but this should be in place before more facial recognition technology is rolled out. "There's no reasonable excuse to be putting even more cameras on our streets before the public have had their say and legislation is brought in to protect all of us." The government says officers using the LFR vans will need to follow the College of Policing's guidance on the technology and the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice. It also says independent testing of the facial recognition algorithm by the National Physical Laboratory found that "the algorithm is accurate and there is no bias for ethnicity, age or gender at the settings used by the police". Chief Superintendent of South Wales Police Tim Morgan said: "We understand the concerns which are raised about the use of live facial recognition technology and we use any new technology ethically and spend time and effort making sure it's deployed in line with all legislation and guidance." The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said: "The government must also invest in comprehensive training programmes for officers to accompany this technology rollout, particularly as police forces face an unprecedented officer retention crisis." Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would "provide police with the tools they need to do their jobs".

Article: Migrants arrive at 'record speed' and 'Fresh inheritance tax grab' 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save The migrant crisis dominates the papers on Wednesday, with the Times leading with the headline "Channel boat migrants arriving at record speed". "It's not our fault!" declares the Mail's headline, leading on comments from Baroness Smith of Malvern, a former Labour home secretary, after she said "what is happening is the result of the last government". The Financial Times says migrants arriving by boat will "add to stresses" for local councils, which will have a duty to house the homeless amid a severe shortage of social homes. The paper also reports that weapons factories in the EU are expanding at three times their rate before the Ukraine war, which they write "represents rearmament on a historic scale". The i Paper is leading with a clampdown on artificial stone imports to the UK, writing that the incoming restrictions have come off the back of their own investigation into rising cases of silicosis among young workers. "Bungling hitwoman in niqab faces life" reads the front page of the Metro, after US woman Aimee Betro was found guilty of attempting to shoot a man dead in the UK. The Sun's headline reads "Taunts of the TikTok migrant", reporting that a man has "boasted on TikTok" of crossing the Channel by dinghy and has "racked up a million views" detailing his journey from an asylum hotel near Heathrow.

Article: The president can only take over the district’s police for “federal purposes” during “special conditions of an emergency,” and only for 30 days at a time, under section 740 of the D.C. From the start, the lack of full self-governance for the district has been a tool for Congress and the president to exert political power over a population that has been majority Black for most of the last century. Now that same unchecked power is being exercised again, with the president openly encouraging law enforcement to “do whatever the hell they want.” History shows exactly who pays the price when that happens — Black, brown and unhoused communities. If the federal government truly cared about safety in the district, it would restore the $1 billion in local tax dollars that Congress recently blocked us from using, resulting in harmful cuts that freeze our own funds without saving the federal government a dime.

Article: A wealthy driver caught for going way too fast on a Swiss city street is facing a fine of more than $110,000 FILE - A vehicle passes in front of a sign of the Vaud Cantonal Police indicating the number of driving licences withdrawn for speeding in the construction zone on the A1 motorway between Lausanne and Yverdon, Switzerland, Tuesday, June 15, 2010. (Dominic Favre/Keystone via AP, file) FILE - A vehicle passes in front of a sign of the Vaud Cantonal Police indicating the number of driving licences withdrawn for speeding in the construction zone on the A1 motorway between Lausanne and Yverdon, Switzerland, Tuesday, June 15, 2010. (Dominic Favre/Keystone via AP, file) GENEVA -- The driver was clocked going 27 kilometers per hour (17 mph) over the speed limit on a street in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and now he's facing up to 90,000 Swiss francs (over $110,000) in fines as a result. Because the speedster, a repeat offender, is one of Switzerland's wealthiest people, and the Vaud canton, or region, serves up fines based on factors like income, fortune or general family financial situation. Back then, the Swiss safety group Road Cross said rich drivers had been lightly punished until voters approved penal law overhaul three years earlier that let judges hand down fines based on personal income and wealth for misdemeanors like speeding and drunk driving. Under today's rules, an indigent person might spend a night in jail instead of a fine, while the wealthiest in the rich Alpine country could be on the hook for tens of thousands. A court in the Swiss canton of Vaud recently ruled that the tycoon must pay 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,300) up front and could be forced to pay the rest — 80,000 more — if he's caught for a similar roadway infraction over the next three years. Switzerland's “24 Heures” newspaper first reported the case and said the man, who was not identified, was a French citizen listed by Swiss economic weekly Bilan among the 300 richest people in Switzerland — with a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The daily reported that an automated police radar photographed the offender driving at 77 kilometers per hour (48 mph) in a 50 kph (31 mph) zone on a Lausanne street. Vincent Derouand, a spokesperson for the Vaud public prosecutors office, said the defendant didn't contest the decision, which was handed down in June for the infraction nearly a year ago — in August 2024. The Vaud criminal code sets a maximum financial penalty based on the "personal and economic situation of the offender at the time of the ruling” — notably taking into account issues like income, fortune, lifestyle and family financial needs. The newspaper reported that he had already been caught for a similar speeding infraction eight years ago, and also paid 10,000 Swiss francs in penalty and faced another 60,000 if another infraction had taken place within the following two years. In Switzerland, penalties for speeding can even catch up with the cops: One officer was fined for racing at nearly twice the speed limit through Geneva streets back in 2016 while chasing thieves who had blown up a bank teller machine.

Article: (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP,File) SANTIAGO, Chile -- What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with “false flight plan data.” Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile’s prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge’s ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was “relieved by the outcome.” For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility.

Article: On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order that mandated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to implement reforms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan where one floor contains holding cells for migrants and asylum seekers. He has also instructed immigration officials to allocate 4.6 square metres (50 square feet) per person, shrinking the capacity of the largest room from 40 or more detainees to just 15. Inside the complaint The changes come in response to a complaint filed by lawyers for a Peruvian asylum-seeker named Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was taken into custody on August 8 after appearing for a scheduled court date. Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.” Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York. “I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday. While ICE has conducted high-profile raids on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings. An analysis published this week by local news outlet The City found that half of all court arrests nationwide in late May and early June took place in New York City.

Article: “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve.

Gurdial Singh Randhawa released a statement saying he was grateful that a suspect had been arrested but that he wanted more information on why the attack was not being investigated as a hate crime. Advertisement “Justice must be served, and our local Sikh community must know that the area around our gurdwara — where we gather to worship, learn, connect, eat, and serve others — is safe for all,” said Randhawa. The Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to combating violence against Sikhs in the U.S., said it was too early to rule out hate as a motive, noting that the suspect has been in custody for less than 24 hours and the victim remains unable to talk. “The reality is that elderly men in our community, especially those who maintain their Sikh articles of faith, like turbans and beards, are subjected to violent attacks far too often,” said Munmeeth Kaur, Sikh Coalition legal director, in a statement. “We are gratified that the LAPD heard the concerns of the community and acted swiftly, but it is far too early to definitively rule out bias as a potential motivation for this assault.” Advertisement McDonnell said that the North Hollywood command would be conducting extra patrols in the area following this incident and continued to engage the community in discussions around public safety concerns. Although Sikhism is a separate religion from Islam, hate crime perpetrators often conflate Muslims with anyone who looks Middle Eastern, and Sikhs with turbans and long beards are often targets.

Article: “My daughter is going to this school, and she's an athlete, representing the school, not just in Midland, but when we travel,” Mayberry said of her youngest, Erinn, a junior varsity basketball player. “What does this say to her that you want to restore a name that meant whites only?” The debate in this West Texas town echoes a renewed national debate over honoring the leaders of the Confederacy, particularly in the South. The cultural tide has shifted with President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his crusade against “wokeness.” Midland ISD Vice President Josh Guinn, elected in 2024, announced his intentions to rename Legacy High School on July 4. “Nobody wants to be a Robert E Lee.” Nearly 40 schools in Texas have retained an association with the Confederacy by name, according to data maintained by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “When you allow a little thing,” like a name, said John McAfee, one of the district’s retired teachers who taught when its classrooms were still partially segregated, “everything is affected.” Legacy Legacy High School opened in 1961. “Instead, remembering history is what should cause us to change the name of the school that was so named in a misguided attempt to honor such history at that particular time.” Later, he added: “It is also about moving forward to reflect the character of our remarkable community.” As part of the renaming process, the board established a committee to brainstorm options. “If you’re going to ask for a committee to be put together and then you don't support it, then what’s the point?” Davis’ critics angered by the name change called him a “woke liberal.” Davis, an elder and trustee of the First Presbyterian Church of Midland and a decades-long civic leader, has served in the top ranks of the local Republican party, advancing conservative causes. “He rejected his sworn oath to defend the United States, and he took up arms against the United States, and he did so to allow states to continue to enslave people, and that's just wrong.” Football The Midland Rebels, the school’s storied football team, has produced an impressive roster of players who disagree on whether their legacy hinges on the school’s name, and others who are afraid it would disappear without it. John Norman, a Midland City Council member who graduated from the school under the old name, said the school can preserve an identity it can be proud of without it. “But I’m not going to go back to a school that you stripped out from under us all and then expect us to start running back to you like you did something great, because you did nothing great for the community.” This article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/11/midland-texas-high-school-confederacy-robert-e-lee/

Train operations had been changed during pickup and drop-off after 15-year-old Milby student, Sergio Rodriguez, was hit and killed by a slow moving train in December 2024, while trying to get to school. HISD sent a statement saying in part " HISD, HISD PD, and Union Pacific remain in contact, and all questions about Union Pacific protocol should be directed to Union Pacific." ABC13 also reached out to the mayor's office. Houston Mayor Whitmire had previously been vocal about the death and the need for safety improvements, but today his office directed our request for a statement to Union Pacific and HISD. $10M in state funding has been required to build a pedestrian bridge over the train tracks near the school, but no timeline for the project has been set at this time.

Article: Durham Elementary parents raise alarm after last minute math curriculum change One parent said teachers were notified on Friday evening that they would have one day to switch their math curriculum to the district's new education system. According to an email from the HISD North Division Chief to Garza, it says the campus went from a B to a C, that the drop was "significant and unacceptable" and that the school now had reduced autonomy. "Not only is the PowerPoint given to them, the lesson objective, the demonstration of learning, the quizzes, the answer keys, the differentiated assignment, and copies are made for them so all of that is going to be provided and I think that is probably what you are referring to," Miles said.

Article: US says UK human rights have worsened in past year 40 minutes ago Share Save Victoria Bourne BBC News Kate Whannel Political reporter Share Save EPA Police on duty in London, August 2024 A report produced by the Trump administration says the human rights situation in the UK has "worsened" over the past year. A UK government spokesperson said: "Free speech is vital for democracy around the world including here in the UK and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe." The report also describes the human rights situation as having "worsened" in France and Germany. It said the response to last year's Southport attacks had been an "especially grievous example of government censorship", adding, "censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech". State department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, without naming the UK specifically, said online restrictions had targeted "disfavoured voices on political or religious grounds." "No matter really how disagreeable someone's speech may be, criminalising it or silencing it by force only serves as a catalyst for further hatred, suppression or polarisation," Bruce told reporters.

Venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz from Theory Ventures also told the BBC that the offer is a lot lower than the browser is worth "given the value of Chrome is likely significantly higher – maybe ten times more valuable than the bid or more." The company has said it would appeal such a ruling, saying the idea of spinning off Chrome was an "unprecedented proposal" that would harm consumers and security. The company made headlines earlier this year after offering to buy the American version of TikTok, which faces a deadline in September to be sold by its Chinese owner or be banned in the US.

Article: Putin reaffirms 'friendship' with North Korea ahead of Trump talks 2 hours ago Share Save Stuart Lau BBC News Share Save SPUTNIK/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Russian President Vladimir Putin has reaffirmed his "friendship" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, ahead of his talks with Donald Trump on Friday. This week, Russia has been making fresh military advances in Ukraine, leading to a sudden thrust near the eastern town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. Putin gave the North Korean leader an update on the Alaska summit's preparation, sharing with him "information in the context of the upcoming talks with US President Donald Trump," the Kremlin said. The Ukrainian army briefly invaded Russia's Kursk region last year in an unexpected offensive that showed Western allies its capability to fight back against Russia, which currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine's territories.

Article: And the rate was the highest since 2003, which had a rate of 44 per 100,000, according to an analysis by Jeff Asher, a crime analyst based in New Orleans. Records dating back to the 1960s show that Washington’s homicide rate peaked in the 1990s at more than 80 per 100,000 people in 1991, or about double the rate in 2023. Trump held up a chart that first appeared on Fox News and was shared by Vice President JD Vance last week purportedly comparing Washington’s homicide rate to that of eight other “capitals.” (One, Lagos, Nigeria, is not a capital.) But the chart cites outdated data and omits several capitals and many other cities with much higher rates. Trump has a point that Washington’s homicide rate is much higher than many capitals, but its rate is nowhere near the highest “anywhere in the world.” In 2023, according to data compiled by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, capitals with higher homicide rates included Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with a rate of 67.2 per 100,000 people; Cape Town, South Africa, with 66.8; Kingston, Jamaica, with 64.2; Caracas, Venezuela, with 47.9; and Guatemala City at 47.8. Overall, the think tank reported, 47 cities with more than 250,000 people had higher homicide rates than 40.4 and 49 cities had rates higher than 39.1, including six in the United States: Memphis, New Orleans, St. According to data compiled by the city’s Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the police made about 1,500 arrests of children in 2020; 1,400 in 2021; 1,700 in 2022; 2,200 in 2023; and 2,000 in 2024. What Was Said “They know, these young gangs — or as they’re called here, crews — they know that if they’re 14, 15, 16, or 17, they’re below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree. And understand I’m not just a federal prosecutor, I’m the local D.A., so to speak here for D.C.: All of the cases go to family court and the goal of family court — the 14- through 17-year-olds — and those cases go to family court where the focus is rehabilitation and they talk about ice cream socials and yoga.” — Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. But youths arrested on other offenses can be prosecuted by the city’s elected attorney general, who prosecuted 84 percent of violent crimes committed by children in 2024, and about 73 percent of all crimes. A recent investigation by The Washington Post also found that the number of dangerous incidents at the center nearly quadrupled in recent years, and that many children are held longer than the stated goal of 30 days.

Article: National Guard troops called on to active-duty by President Donald Trump arrived at the footsteps of the Washington Monument on Tuesday as part of his plan to address what he insists is "out of control" crime in the nation's capital. Dave Butler, an Army spokesperson, said the troops were called on to help local law enforcement with logistics support, transportation and administration duties, as well as being visible around the National Mall. Troops load boxes of rifle ammunition at the District of Columbia National Guard Headquarters as President Donald Trump implements his order to use federal law enforcement and the National Guard to expel homeless people and rid the nation's capital of violent crime, in Washington, D.C., Aug. Like all service members serving in the U.S., the Guard will fall under the Standing Rules for the Use of Force, similar to what was used during the deployment of federalized Guard members to Los Angeles following protests against immigration raids. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Appearing on Fox News on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the activated Guard troops will have “broad latitude” under existing authorities, but “they're not going to be involved in law enforcement functions.” Earlier this year, Trump activated other Guard personnel in Los Angeles to protect immigration agents conducting raids and arrests.

(DreamWorks Animation/Universal Pictures via AP) The good news for fans of “The Bad Guys” is the new sequel is stellar. Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days — amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. “I'm just asking for a chance.” A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron — so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew — Danielle Brooks’ lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova’s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne’s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on “Poker Face.” These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever — or lazy — joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot. There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire — voice acted by Colin Jost — who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a “24-carat catastrophe.” The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. Based on Aaron Blabey’s popular graphic book series, the first movie in 2022 drove hard into the nature of good and evil — like asking if DNA determines behavior — as our heroes whipsawed between heroic and villainous, to the glee of all the kiddies in the theater. (Another thing to chew on: If “The Bad Guys 2” is a worse sequel, does that make “The Bad Guys” good?) When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a “The Bad Guys 3.” (There's going to be a “The Bad Guys 3.”) The joy of “The Bad Guys” was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like “Ocean’s 11.” This time, the “Fast & Furious” series gets mocked, as does “Silence of the Lambs,” “Men in Black” and maybe “Moonraker,” which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: “We've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!” The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers — the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time — but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag’n’Bone Man. It means the folks behind “The Bad Guys 2” reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but — c'mon, everyone — they didn't make it count.

Article: Russian President Vladimir Putin lauded the “bravery” and “heroism” of North Korean soldiers in retaking Russia’s Kursk region from Ukrainian forces during a call with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean state media has reported. Putin told Kim that he “highly appreciated” North Korea’s support and the “self-sacrificing spirit” displayed by its troops during the liberation of the western region, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Wednesday. Kim expressed his “heartfelt thanks” to Putin and said Pyongyang would “always remain faithful” to the spirit of the mutual defence treaty signed by the sides last year, as well as “fully support all measures to be taken by the Russian leadership in the future”, the KCNA said. “Kim Jong Un and Putin agreed to make closer contact in the future.” The call, days before Putin is set to meet United States President Donald Trump in Alaska to discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine, is the latest sign of strengthening ties between North Korea and Russia amid Moscow’s ostracisation on the world stage. “There are a lot of ifs still in the air, but the call suggests there’s a role for Russia, similar to the role South Korea played in 2018, in helping create an opening for US-DPRK relations,” Jenny Town, the director of the Korea programme at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “It might not be a focal point of the upcoming meeting but it is likely to be part of the conversation.” Advertisement Last month, Kim told Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov that Pyongyang would “unconditionally support” all actions taken by Moscow in Ukraine, according to North Korean state media reports. North Korea has deployed more than 10,000 troops to support Russia’s war and has drawn up plans to dispatch thousands more, according to assessments by South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. On Monday, he told reporters that he will probably know within the “first two minutes” of meeting Putin whether they can reach a deal and that any agreement would involve “some swapping, changes in land” between Moscow and Kyiv.

Article: The White House has ordered an extensive review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions in advance of next year’s 250th anniversary of the United States, with the goal of aligning the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of US history. In a letter sent on Tuesday to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House laid out in detail the steps it expects the organisation to take so that museum content can be reviewed for a focus on “Americanism”. The federal government will review public-facing museum content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals”, the letter said. “This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter added. At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”. Advertisement “Donald Trump’s idea that the National Museum of African American History and Culture is guilty of distorting our nation’s history or painting our ‘founding principles’ in a ‘negative light’ is patently ridiculous,” the caucus said in a statement. The White House said the review would initially focus on the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The museums under review are all located in Washington, DC, where the president this week ordered the deployment of the US National Guard to tackle a purported crime wave that city officials in the capital have refuted. The Smithsonian Institution, which runs 21 museums and the National Zoo, said at the time that the impeachment section of the museum would be updated in the coming weeks to “reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history”.

Article: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has put Israel and Russia “on notice” that their armed forces and security personnel could be listed among parties “credibly suspected” of committing sexual violence in conflict zones. The warning on Tuesday resulted from “significant concerns regarding patterns of certain forms of sexual violence that have been consistently documented by the United Nations”, Guterres wrote in a report seen by the Reuters news agency. In his annual report to the UN Security Council on conflict-related sexual violence, Guterres said that Israel and Russia could be listed next year among the parties “credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence”. In his warning to Israel, Guterres said he was “gravely concerned about credible information of violations by Israeli armed and security forces” against Palestinians in several prisons, a detention centre and a military base. “Cases documented by the United Nations indicate patterns of sexual violence such as genital violence, prolonged forced nudity and repeated strip searches conducted in an abusive and degrading manner,” Guterres wrote. Because Israel has denied access to UN monitors, it has been “challenging to make a definitive determination” about patterns, trends and the systematic use of sexual violence by its forces, he said, urging Israel’s government “to take the necessary measures to ensure immediate cessation of all acts of sexual violence, and make and implement specific time-bound commitments.” Advertisement The UN chief said these should include investigations of credible allegations, clear orders and codes of conduct for military and security forces that prohibit sexual violence, and unimpeded access for UN monitors. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel said it documented a range of violations perpetrated against Palestinian women, men, girls and boys, and accused Israeli forces of rape and sexual violence against Palestinian detainees. In July 2024, the Israeli military said it had detained and was questioning nine soldiers over the alleged sexual abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the infamous Sde Teiman prison facility, which was set up to detain people arrested in Gaza. Israeli media reported at the time that a Palestinian prisoner was taken to hospital after suffering severe injuries from what was an alleged gang rape by military guards at the prison. In the case of Russia, Guterres wrote that he was “gravely concerned about credible information of violations by Russian armed and security forces and affiliated armed groups”, primarily against Ukrainian prisoners of war, in 50 official and 22 unofficial detention facilities in Ukraine and Russia.

Article: Just a short walk away, diners mingle in a BYD-branded restaurant over craft beer and bar bites in a chic, members’ club-like setting – one of several lifestyle ventures the Chinese electric vehicle giant has rolled out across Singapore. The EV maker sold almost 4,670 cars – about 20 percent of total vehicle sales – during the period, according to government data, compared with about 3,460 vehicles sold by second-ranked Toyota. Singapore and Malaysia had the biggest concentration of Chinese food and beverage brands in Southeast Asia last year, according to the research firm Momentum Works, with 32 China-based firms operating 184 outlets in the city-state as of June 2024. Compared with Japanese or Korean brands, she said, Chinese chains are “creative, quick to innovate and set food trends”, though she admits it sometimes feels like they are “taking over” from local brands. For younger Singaporeans, the old stigmas around products “made in China” are fading, said Samer Elhajjar, senior lecturer at the marketing department of the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Business School. Doris Ho, who led a brand consultancy in Greater China from 2010 to 2022, said that Chinese brands have been able to succeed in Singapore with a bold, creative approach to innovation that appeals to local sensibilities. This “new China edge”, Ho said, shows up in BYD features, such as built-in fridges and spacious, fold-flat interiors that can be used for sleeping, and hotpot chain Haidilao’s extravagant hospitality, which sees customers treated to live music performances, shoeshines, hand massages and manicures. As Western firms scaled back or paused expansion, Chinese brands moved in, with many effectively propping up Singapore’s property sector and entrenching themselves in the country, said Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). “The US has acted in a miserly, resentful sort of way with ongoing trade tariffs, whereas China remains a factory of the world – seen as an economic benefactor – so there will be a swing in terms of looking at China favourably.” Chong said that Singapore has also become a virtual second home for some middle-class Chinese nationals, many of whom own property in the city-state. In a report released earlier this year by China’s Ministry of Education and the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, Singapore was ranked the second-most popular destination for Chinese students after the United Kingdom. Some analysts have observed the rise of “born-again Chinese” (BAC) – people of Chinese descent outside China, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, who embrace a strong pro-China identity, despite limited cultural or linguistic ties. Donald Low, a lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has defined so-called BACs as those who adopt an “idealised, romanticised” idea of a China that is “inevitably rising” and “stands heroically against a hegemonic West”. Some Singapore residents have felt alienated by stores that operate mainly in Mandarin Chinese, Elhajjar said, given that the city-state has one of the world’s largest immigrant populations, as well as large minorities of native-born Malays and Indians. Leong Chan-Hoong, the head of the RSIS Social Cohesion Research programme, cautioned against blaming Chinese enterprises for social tensions or rising rents, describing the inroads made by some brands as part of the natural cycle of a market-driven economy. Ly Nguyen, a 29-year-old Vietnamese migrant working in tech sales, said she started collecting Labubu, the globally popular gremlin-like toys created by Pop Mart, after being captivated by their “ugly but fun” aesthetic. For Nguyen, the popularity of Labubu dolls, which have been spotted with celebrities such as Rihanna and BLACKPINK’s Lisa, points to a generational shift in how Chinese cultural exports are viewed.

Article: JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once, rather than in phases. Arab officials told The Associated Press last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar were preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all remaining hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for ceasefire talks on Tuesday, Egypt’s state-run Qahera news channel reported, a sign that efforts have not been abandoned after 22 months of war. Israel has threatened to widen its military offensive against Hamas to the areas of Gaza that it does not yet control, and where most of the territory’s 2 million residents have sought refuge. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce. “The release of all the hostages, both alive and dead — that’s the stage we’re at.” He added, however, that Israel’s demands haven’t changed, and that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. Hamas has long called for a comprehensive deal but says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. and its humanitarian partners are doing everything possible to bring aid into Gaza, he said, but still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities that prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed. It has killed more than 61,400 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children. Israel says it struck militants disguised as aid workers In a separate development, the Israeli military said it recently struck a group of militants in Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen.

Article: Heartbreaking images of children starving in Gaza have caused what some Jewish Americans call a “rupture” between supporters of Israel’s offensive in its current form and those who oppose how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is managing the war. “We’re seeing not only divisiveness, but hatred between us, and that’s not a good thing for the future,” said Rabbi Erez Sherman of Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. How do we work on that?” But support for Israel remains ironclad among many American Jewish groups and rabbis, who argue that Hamas is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching innocent civilians. “Israel has facilitated an extraordinary amount of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, in wartime, and that’s really an unprecedented situation,” said Belle Etra Yoeli, spokesperson for the American Jewish Committee, which recently ran a full-page ad in The New York Times with the image of an Israeli hostage who remains in Hamas custody. “Israel doesn’t want that.” Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 have been injured seeking food in Gaza, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week. distribution sites, as a means of sort of misattributing those attacks either to the IDF or to being in proximity to GHF,” he added, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. “To me, it’s an impossible task, and I give credit to somebody who is at least trying to do that.” Polling suggests Jewish Americans are divided over Netanyahu’s handling of the war. Supporters of Netanyahu’s government, including several Jewish American organizations, have said Hamas is spreading misleading information about who is to blame for ongoing violence at aid sites, a claim Hamas has repeatedly denied. “All of this can just be stopped anytime if Hamas puts down its weapons,” said Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization that supports Netanyahu’s government. But according to Rabbi Ari Lev Fornari of Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in Philadelphia, the war is creating an “existential rupture” that is pitting friends and family members against one another. “We’re wrestling with the very question ‘Do we belong to each other?’” Fornari was among more than 40 people arrested outside Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month as they shouted for the United States to stop arming Israel and feed Gaza. In May, two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and a Colorado pro-Israeli hostages group was attacked with two Molotov cocktails in June. Sonya Meyerson-Knox, a spokesperson for the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace, which has opposed the war since 2023, said a member was uninvited to Shabbat family dinners because of differing opinions about the war.

The only other title from 2025 to make the list is Sylvester Stallone’s “Alarum.” Just one critic, Jordan Hoffman of Entertainment Weekly, gave "War of the Worlds" a certified fresh ranking, writing, "It's certainly stupid, but it’s also a great deal of fun." Most others described the film as the worst take on Wells’ 1898 novel about Martians invading Earth. Lee “butchers the classic sci-fi parable on humankind’s colonialist ills and creates an obnoxiously dull, utterly braindead (arguable bootleg) exercise in capitalist, surveillance state propaganda,” wrote one Rotten Tomatoes critic. (Universal Pictures is a division of NBC News’ parent company, NBC Universal.) But as with some other films that receive poor reviews, the reaction to "War of the Worlds" has also made it buzzy. “Sounds like Ice Cube is reading directly from a script that he had never seen before...,” a TikToker wrote in the text of their video, which featured a clip from the film. Vetz, a YouTube channel that ranks and review movies, cited the product placement as one of the main reasons the film ranks on its 10 worst movies of 2025 list.

The Trump administration froze $584 million in science, medical and other federal grants, citing the university’s alleged discrimination in admissions and failure to “promote a research environment free of antisemitism.” The totality of UCLA freezes cover research funded by the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy. Advertisement At question during the Tuesday hearing was whether cuts to NSF grants were illegal under Lin’s June court order that blocked science funding terminations to many UC researchers throughout the nine-campus system. UC professors funded by the NSF, Environmental Protection Agency and National Endowment for the Humanities had sued, arguing they faced cuts because their grants appeared in federal keyword searches related to race amid President Trump’s push to rid the government of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Another DOJ lawyer, Michael Velchik, argued that the grants had been cut so recently that they could not be viewed as “terminations.” “A week is certainly not enough time for this court to adjudicate that a suspension of one week is de facto a termination,” Velchik said. Lin later added: “For avoidance of doubt, the court also clarifies that grant ‘termination,’ as the term is used in the preliminary Injunction, encompasses circumstances where grant funding is cut off on a long-term or indefinite basis, like the suspensions carried out by NSF on July 30” at UCLA. The government lawyers also said the Trump administration did not freeze all grants to UCLA but spared some that were “critical” and “important.” Advertisement They did not elaborate on which or how many grants those were. Chemerinsky said that the UCLA cuts amounted to “exactly the kind of en masse terminations that the court enjoined previously.” For researchers, he said, the terms “suspension” and “termination” are the same. “There are legitimate and bona fide concerns that the government has with the conduct that has taken place at UCLA,” he said, saying the university has had “gross and horrific” antisemitism and also mentioning allegations of “racial preferences” at the UCLA medical school.

Article: AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Senate Democrats walked off the Senate floor and out of the chamber on Tuesday in protest as the upper chamber began debating a proposed new congressional map that aims to give Republicans more seats in the House of Representatives. The move was primarily symbolic, as after a short debate, Texas Republicans had enough support to pass the proposed new congressional map by a 19-2 vote in the upper chamber. Even though it has cleared the upper chamber, the bills will likely die and not move forward in the House, which has been stalled for the last nine days since House Democrats broke quorum and fled the state. Some of the senators, including Roland Gutierrez (D-San Antonio) and Molly Cook (D-Houston), said they did not plan to return to the chamber to participate in debate on other bills, such as those related to the July floods, which killed more than 130 people and caused billions of dollars in damage across Texas. Jose Menendez (D-San Antonio) asked Senate President Pro Tem Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) if the upper chamber could take up the flood bills first before the redistricting, but Perry denied that, saying he wanted to save it for later in the day to end the day on a positive note. “Our options here to push back to fight in the Senate are pretty limited, so we are using every tool that we have to demonstrate our opposition.” Senate Bill 4 is identical to the map proposed by the House. The push to redraw the congressional district map follows President Donald Trump's urging of Texas Republicans to redraw the congressional districts to secure five more Republican seats in the U.S. “We have a lot of work to do to serve Texans who are desperate for flood relief and red flag orders against this national nightmare of mass shootings.” Senate Redistricting Committee Chair State Sen. “In contrast to the complications involved with race-based redistricting, this map is built on political performance, which is a well-established and permissible basis for drawing electoral districts as recognized firmly by the Supreme Court of the United States,” King said. “Race was not used to draw the map, and I did not consider race when I filed this bill, and I have not looked to any racial criteria with regard to this bill.” Democrats criticize the redraw as being conducted on racial lines. “This is just another attempt of a hostile, rogue, racist takeover of democracy being directed by the president of the United States to protect him and the Republican Party, followed through by the governor of this state,” State Sen. “We will not take part in democracy being washed out in this state of Texas.” King said his secondary goal with the proposed new map was to draw the districts more compactly. Similar to the House proposal, the main districts that see changes to give Republicans a better chance of winning are CD 9 in Houston, CD 28 in the Rio Grande Valley, CD 32 in Dallas, CD 34 along the South Texas coast and CD 35 in Central Texas. The Senate also advanced Senate Bill 13, which provides credits for cities and counties to make flood prevention fixes, and Senate Bill 43, which allows the TCEQ to issue permits for dam and reservoir repairs. “The bills that we're going to consider, they are not going anywhere because the Democrats in the House, with whom we stand in unity, are not going to cave,” state Sen. Everything we're doing right now, we are going to end up having to do again." The Texas House was once again unable to establish a quorum on Tuesday, as dozens of House Democrats remain scattered throughout other states. The governor said the second special session will include 18 items on the agenda from the current special session, such as redistricting and flood response, but could also include others. “I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed." Cook asked what took so long for Republicans to act on flood relief. “Wasting your time, wasting your money and insulting not just the people who recently died in the most horrifying way, but every single one of our communities that has lived through a hurricane, a wildfire, a tornado, a power outage or any of the other horrific scenes that we are never prepared for in this state.” This is the ninth day the Democrats have broken quorum and brought the lower chamber to a standstill. John Cornyn and Burrows – from ordering Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to conduct civil arrests if the Democrats return to Texas, to reportedly getting the FBI involved in Illinois, where many of the Democrats went when they left. Dan Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, urged Democrats to return before Friday and said if they don’t, the governor will call as many special sessions as it takes to get the bills passed. Gene Wu (D-Houston) said Democrats want to address the flooding, but if Republicans focus on redistricting again, he said, "All options are on the table." “Now, the ball is in Abbott’s court: He can stop blocking flood relief immediately. “We’re ready to help the communities that are still rebuilding from the deadliest flood Texas has seen in over 100 years.” Burrows added that he has been in constant communication with DPS, as troopers work to track down the Democrats to return them to the chamber. He said DPS is keeping track of every taxpayer dollar that has been spent in their effort to compel the Democrats' attendance, and that amount is well over six figures in DPS overtime. “If the devastation in our Hill country communities, the Texas Constitution and their mounting debt aren't enough to bring them back today, they should yet again be reminded this is not going away,” Burrows said.

Article: WASHINGTON — Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border. It’s the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores — under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.” The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration’s threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando Gómez Martinez, also known as “La Tuta,” a former school teacher who became one of Mexico’s most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel. Alongside his two brothers, Abigael González Valencia led “Los Cuinis,” which financed the the founding and growth of the CJNG, one of the most powerful and dangerous cartels in Mexico.

US National Guard troops have begun appearing on the streets of Washington DC, a day after President Donald Trump deployed the troops to the city and took control of its police force as he argued violent crime was out of control. "Over the course of the next month, the Trump administration will relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in the District who breaks the law, undermines public safety, and endangers law-abiding Americans." Getty Images FBI Director Kash Patel later said FBI agents were involved in around half of those arrests. "What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the federal officers that we have," Bowser said after a meeting on Tuesday with US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said: "We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx of enhanced presence, we know that it's going to make our city even better." But at a town hall on Tuesday night, the mayor sharpened her criticism of Trump. Bowser called on community members to "protect our city, to protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push", according to the New York Times. Getty Images It comes as a manhunt was launched for an armed assailant who killed a man on Monday night in Logan Circle, one of Washington DC's trendiest neighbourhoods, just a mile from the White House. But DC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton has disputed those figures, previously accusing the city police department of "deliberately falsifying crime data, creating a false narrative of reduced crime while communities suffer".

"It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska," Ushakov said. The last time Alaska took centre-stage in an American diplomatic event was in March 2021, when Joe Biden's newly minted diplomatic and national security team met their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage. Trump said on Monday: "I would say he could go, but he's been to a lot of meetings." Trump did, however, say that Zelensky would be the first person he would call afterwards. Watch: 'We're going to change the battle lines' Trump on the war in Ukraine Meanwhile, Putin has not budged from his territorial demands, Ukraine's neutrality and the future size of its army.

Article: The 35-year-old employs about 40 workers who transform rough diamonds into perfectly polished gems for exports at the small factory in Surat, a city located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. But United States President Donald Trump’s mammoth 50 percent tariffs on imports from India might be the final nail in the coffin for his unit, part of an already struggling natural diamond industry, he said. “It is becoming increasingly difficult to pay the salaries and maintain other expenses with falling orders.” He is among the 20,000-odd small and medium traders in Surat, known as the “Diamond City of India”, which together cut and polish 14 out of every 15 natural diamonds produced globally. According to the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), India’s apex body for the industry, the country exported cut and polished gems worth $4.8bn to the US in the 2024-25 financial year, which ended in March. This is the worst phase of my two-decade-old career in diamonds.” US imposes penalty A 25 percent reciprocal tariff on all Indian goods, which Trump announced on April 2, came into effect on August 7, after talks between the two countries failed to yield a trade deal by then. He termed the additional tariff that would come into effect from August 27 as a penalty for India’s continued buying of Russian oil, as the US president tries to push Moscow into accepting a ceasefire in Ukraine. Ajay Srivastava, the founder of Global Research Trade Initiative (GTRI), a trade research group, termed the Trump government’s additional hike as an act of “hypocrisy”, citing how the US itself continues to trade with Russia, and how China – Russia’s biggest oil buyer – faces no similar penalty. “Trump is targeting India out of frustration as it refused to toe the US line on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and for its refusal to open its agriculture and dairy sector,” he added, referring to broader ongoing trade talks and differences over US demands for greater access to critical Indian economic sectors. Diamond sector badly hit More than 2 million people are employed in diamond polishing and cutting units in Surat, Ahmedabad and Rajkot cities in Gujarat — and many have already suffered salary cuts in recent years, first because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The situation in the international market led to the wages of the workers getting halved to approximately 15,000-17,000 rupees ($194) per month, which made survival difficult in the face of rising inflation,” he said. A 13,500-rupee ($154) allowance per child, to support their families, was promised in May by the state government to those who have lost jobs due to the tumult in the sector in recent years. Decline in exports In the 2024-25 financial year, India imported rough diamonds worth $10.8bn, marking a 24.27 percent decline from the $14bn imported in 2023-24, as per the statistics by the GJEPC. A stronger domestic market “would not only contribute to the local economy, but would also create jobs for several thousands of people”, said Radha Krishna Agrawal, the director of Narayan das Saraf Jewellers in Varanasi city, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

Article: I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Here are the most important factors experts say to keep in mind when shopping for a prepared meal delivery service: Serving size: A single-serve prepared meal service is great for folks only feeding themselves. Dietary restrictions: If you’re gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan or follow any other specific type of diet, scan the service’s weekly menu to confirm that it has options to fit those dietary needs. Best overall Factor $ 67.45 $ 134.90 Factor Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: starting at $13 per serving with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 6 to 18 per week What we like Quick and easy Choice of 5 plans Seamless delivery Something to note Options can get overwhelming Get $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor’s website. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to many diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. Courtesy Mili Godio I tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient — after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in under 10 minutes. Best variety CookUnity $ 46.88 $ 93.76 CookUnity Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: starting at $11 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 4 to 16 meals per week What we like Great for many dietary needs Reusable packaging Varied plans Something to note May need extra prep work Cookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. Courtesy Zoe Malin “The convenience is unbeatable — it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn’t feel limited by the menu at all,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). “This didn’t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved — if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,” says Malin. The meals are also easy to prepare: “All I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,” says Brown. Best for most dietary restrictions BistroMD $ 109.90 $ 219.80 BistroMD Now 50% off What to know Type: prepared | Cost: Starting at $7 per meal for the 7-day plan and $8 per meal for the 5-day plan, with an additional $20 for shipping | Number of meals: 5 or 7 meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner per week | Serving size: single-serve What we like Meets most dietary needs Snacks available Something to note High shipping cost Only two plans BistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you’re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans — you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. The service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men’s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women’s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days. Best vegan Purple Carrot $ 79.00 $ 104.00 Purple Carrot Now 24% off What to know Type: meal kit | Cost: starting at $13 per serving for pre-made meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 6 to 10 for prepared meals per week What we like Meal kits available Great for plant-based diets All plant-based Something to note Can't choose delivery date Purple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, all of which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. “The pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.” You can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Best for families Home Chef $ 55.94 $ 79.92 Home Chef Now 30% off What to know Type: meal kit | Cost: starting at $10 per meal, with a minimum weekly order value of $51 (Home Chef Plan) or $83 (Family Plan) | Serving size: 2, 4 or 6 | Number of meals: 2 to 6 meals per week What we like Customizable Great for multi-servings Personalized menu Something to note Limited pre-made options Combined with meal kits Home Chef’s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef offers about 10 prepared options. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. Best gluten free Sunbasket $ 75.92 $ 115.92 Sunbasket Now 35% off What to know Type: meal kit and prepared | Cost: starting at $12 per serving for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals, with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 for meal kits, single-serve for Fresh & Ready meals | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week What we like Meal kits available Great for multiple diets Customizable Something to note Not for larger families Sunbasket is made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in your oven or microwave and add to your order each week. “There were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy-to-follow recipe — I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don’t normally buy,” she says. “And don’t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.” Best prepared and meal kit combo Blue Apron $ 31.96 $ 57.95 Blue Apron Now 45% off What to know What we like Great variety of meals Meal kits available Something to note Not for large families Lacks some variety Not for certain dietary needs Blue Apron recently joined the prepared meal delivery scene with its Prepared & Ready plan, and it now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. Courtesy Mili Godio I tried Blue Apron’s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I’m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. Best for healthy eaters Splendid Spoon $ 161.88 Splendid Spoon What to know What we like Snacks available Choose delivery frequency Healthier options Something to note Can’t choose number of meals Splendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. While you can’t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month. Best for sensitive stomachs Epicured $ 114.58 $ 163.69 Epicured Now 30% off What to know What we like Good for digestion issues Breakfast and dessert options Snacks available Something to note Higher price point Epicured’s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don’t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. Though there are plenty of benefits to a prepared meal delivery services, there are a few downsides to keep in mind: Most meals are single-serve: Prepared meal delivery services are ideal if you’re only feeding yourself. You may be sacrificing taste: Though many prepared services have a variety of meal options on their menu that both taste and look great, you probably won’t get the same experience as a fresh, home-cooked meal.

Article: FRISCO, Texas — A North Texas spine surgeon is performing life-saving work in the middle of one of the world’s most dangerous conflict zones, with almost nothing to work with. “Most of the injuries we are seeing are patients that have gone to aid distribution sites and have suffered gunshot wounds or are being run over by trucks,” Khaleel said. On Instagram, the doctors have documented the stories behind those injuries through the group they've formed, 'Gift of Disability Alleviation': a 12-year-old left paralyzed after being shot in the neck near an aid site, and another man struck by a tank shell in the same area are just some of the cases. The violence at aid locations is so frequent that Khaleel says, “going to the aid distribution site is known to be a risk for death or injury.” European and US doctors are primarily sharing that startling revelation while performing their volunteer work.

And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised. Why rare earths matter The phrase "rare earths" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors - is something of a misnomer. "China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries," says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper. It comes at a cost." And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade. "This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China." The Australian government sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply," Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.

Article: Thousands of people have evacuated, schools have closed, and hundreds of flights have been cancelled as Typhoon Podul approaches southern Taiwan with wind gusts as strong as 191kph (118 mph). Podul “is strengthening”, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration (CWA) forecaster Lin Ting-yi said, with the typhoon on track to hit the sparsely populated Taitung County at about noon local time (04:00 GMT). After making landfall, the storm is expected to hit Taiwan’s more densely populated western coast before moving into the Taiwan Strait and towards China’s southern province of Fujian later this week. As much as 600mm (almost 24 inches) of rain has been forecast in southern mountainous areas over the next few days, the CWA said, while nine cities and counties announced the suspension of work and school, including the southern metropolises of Kaohsiung and Tainan. Taiwan’s government said that more than 5,500 people had been evacuated in advance of the typhoon’s arrival, and all domestic flights – a total of 252 – as well as 129 international routes have been cancelled, the transport ministry said. pic.twitter.com/qaeCwFg9Vu — Focus Taiwan (CNA English News) (@Focus_Taiwan) August 13, 2025 Advertisement Taiwan’s two main international carriers, China Airlines and EVA Air, said their cancellations were for routes out of Kaohsiung, with some flights from the island’s main international airport at Taoyuan stopped as well.

Article: The administration of United States President Donald Trump has circulated plans for its $175bn “Golden Dome” missile defence system, revealing a possible new missile field in the Midwest and details of the project’s plans to shoot down missiles in space, the Reuters news agency reports. According to a series of slides, titled “Go Fast, Think Big!”, presented to some 3,000 defence contractors in Huntsville, Alabama, last week, Reuters says that plans for the Golden Dome include three layers of missile interceptors, radar arrays and lasers, in addition to its space-based defences. While the presentation highlighted that the US “has built both interceptors and re-entry vehicles” for space-based missile interception before, the plans also acknowledged that the US has never built a vehicle that can handle the heat of reentry while targeting an enemy missile, according to Reuters. Reuters said the slides did not include any references to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which was part of a bid for Golden Dome contracts, alongside the software maker Palantir and defence systems manufacturer Anduril. Days after taking office on January 27, Trump signed an executive order to “immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans”. Although Trump secured $25bn for the system in his tax and spending bill, which also included significant cuts to federal funding for other programmes, including Medicaid, the project still faces a significant funding shortfall.

Article: Wife of South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon arrested over corruption allegations toggle caption Jung Yeon-je/AP via AFP SEOUL, South Korea — The wife of South Korea's jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol has been arrested as investigators seek to charge her over various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a candidate. The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul's new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, a conservative who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December. While Yoon's self-inflicted downfall extended a decades-long run of South Korean presidencies ending badly, he and Kim are the first former presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations. The investigation team led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki, who was appointed in June by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, initially questioned Kim for about seven hours on Wednesday last week before deciding to seek her arrest. Kim spoke briefly to reporters as she appeared for last week's questioning, issuing a vague apology for causing public concern but also hinting that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as "someone insignificant." Investigators suspect that Kim and Yoon exerted undue influence on the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Sponsor Message Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company. Min's investigation team arrested one of Kim's close associates earlier Tuesday following his arrival from Vietnam, as they look into suspicions that he used his connection to the former first lady to secure millions of dollars in business investments for his financially struggling company. The investigators also raided a construction company on Monday over allegations that its chairman purchased a luxury necklace reportedly worth $43,000, which they believe was the same one Kim wore while accompanying Yoon on a 2022 trip to Europe. Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon's martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident the liberals claim Yoon's government tried to cover up. Sponsor Message Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month following a March release and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, has repeatedly resisted investigators' attempts to compel him to answer questions about his wife.

Article: Thirteen children died after falling from windows in six years 17 minutes ago Share Save Meghan Owen, Tarah Welsh & Naresh Puri BBC News Share Save Family pic One-year-old Exodus Eyob died when he fell from a seventh floor window in Leeds in 2022 Thirteen children have died in falls from windows in their rented or temporary accommodation in England since 2019, according to a study into fatalities of very young and primary-school age children. The National Housing Federation, which represents England's housing associations, told us that social landlords have increased the number of checks they do to make sure buildings are "compliant with current regulations and safety requirements". Windows in the Leeds flat where Exodus Eyob lived were not defective, ruled an inquest The 13 children in the NCMD report were all aged under 11, and died between April 2019 and the end of May 2025. One of the children who died was Exodus Eyob, who was a year old when he fell out of an open window from the seventh floor of a Leeds tower block in 2022. The lawyer who represented his family at his inquest, Gareth Naylor, tells the BBC that in a "split second" of an adult leaving the room, the toddler climbed on a bed and fell. "What they ignored during [Exodus's] inquest is that these apartments are tiny, and the bed can only go under the window." If children are housed in towers, believes Mr Naylor, "a mesh or a guard" should be added for protection. Other fatalities include five-year-old Aalim Ahmed, who fell in May 2024 from the kitchen window of a social housing flat on the 15th storey of an east London tower block - and two deaths this year of two-year-olds, one in Gloucestershire and the other in south London. Tracey McGurk is worried about the safety of her windows when her grandchildren visit The number of deaths in the NCMD study is "very distressing" says the social housing watchdog, the Housing Ombudsman Service. One resident in Fulham uses duct tape to try to make their windows safer Examples from the watchdog's report include a mother unable to close some of her windows properly for four years, a window coming loose from its frame in a baby's room, and residents using duct tape to hold windows together. Duct tape is also how one council tenant in west London told us he had tried to make his windows safer, because he was so worried about his nine-year-old daughter. The tenant, who lives on the Lancaster Court Estate in Fulham, also says at one point, broken handles, which the council said were unfixable, meant a window was stuck open for a week during the winter. In total, we spoke to a dozen residents on the estate, which is owned by Hammersmith and Fulham Council, and saw that visibly broken windows without handles were a widespread problem, as well as mould around window frames. "We're investing more than £1m every week to refurbish and repair our ageing housing stock," a spokesperson for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said, "part of a bold, three-year strategy that includes replacing every window that has reached the end of its life." The council is "not just meeting the housing ombudsman's window safety standards, we're exceeding them," they added. "Replacing windows can be complex and costly," says Richard Blakeway, "but there can be no justification for the conditions some residents have endured." Rise in hospital admissions At Manchester Royal Infirmary, more than double the number of children attended with major trauma from a window fall between April and June this year, than in any similar period since 2020, the BBC has been told. A lot of the families said they knew the window was broken, or would not lock, and that no action had been taken despite reporting it to a landlord, says Dr Mottershead. Pre-school children are particularly susceptible to falls because of their lack of awareness of danger - and because their bodies are top heavy - says the Child Accident Prevention Trust says. A government consultation on how to improve standards in both private and socially rented homes is currently taking place - and it is looking at how to ensure that all rented homes in England have child-resistant restrictors on any windows that present a fall risk.

Article: A federal judge will hear closing arguments in a hearing over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws MIAMI -- A federal judge is set to hear closing arguments Wednesday over whether to stop construction indefinitely at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a two-week halt on new construction last Thursday as witnesses continued to testify in a hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe want Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction, which they say threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration. Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday who testified that the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers. Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles executive director David Kerner testified that the 1,800 state troopers under his command are authorized to detain undocumented migrants under an agreement with the U.S. He said the federal government doesn't tell the state where to detain immigrants, and that the Everglades facility was built to alleviate overcrowding at federal immigration detention facilities, as well as state and county facilities with agreements to hold federal immigration detainees. Kerner couldn't say how many of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detainees have been charged with violent crimes or whether any other sites besides the middle of the Everglades were considered for possible detention centers. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit because the detention center is in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Article: (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) FILE - Crosses are surrounded by flowers and other mementos at a memorial, June 9, 2022, for the victims of a shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Newly released records surrounding the May 2022 massacre, including hundreds of pages of files and hours of body camera video, show in greater detail the heartbreak and failures of one the worst school shootings in U.S. The official narrative that police quickly rushed to confront and kill 18-year-old gunman Salvador Ramos had been quickly dismissed by parents who stood outside the school begging for officers to go inside or let them get to their children. As he donned his ballistics vest, a voice says, “Something needs to be done, ASAP.” After some children run from the school and officers report finding an AR-15 rifle, one officer can be heard saying, “We need to get in there, fast.” It would be another hour before law enforcement breached the classroom and killed Ramos. She told deputies Ramos never hit her, but they made a note in their report: “Ms Reyes stated she was scared of Salvador and wanted help.” Ramos’ grandmother took him to her house and deputies took no further action. In October 2021 — seven months before the shooting — Ramos withdrew from high school because of “poor academic performance, lack of attendance.” Records showed he failed nearly all his classes. Crouched behind the school building sizing up an assault on the classroom from the outside, an officer says, “I just don’t want to be crawling and he’s just looking down on me.” Former school police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been described as the incident commander, can be heard shouting to Ramos, asking him put down his weapon. Once police realized there were children hiding in other classrooms, Arredondo is heard telling officers crouched around him they want to clear those rooms before breaching the classroom where Ramos is holed up. “We're gonna save the lives of the other ones.” The law enforcement response included local, state and federal officers, but Arredondo and former school district police officer Adrian Gonzales are the only two to face criminal charges. ___ Associated Press reporters John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri; Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia; and Ed White in Detroit contributed.

Article: Officials in a rural Tennessee town have voted to approve agreements to turn a former state prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious pub... -- Officials in a rural Tennessee town voted Tuesday to approve agreements to turn a former state prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting. The five-member Board of Alderman in Mason, plus Mayor Eddie Noeman and Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, met in a fire station garage to discuss converting the closed West Tennessee Detention Facility into a U.S. Also present were a few dozen vocal, angry members of the public who oppose allowing ICE to house immigrants in Mason who have been taken into custody as President Donald Trump pushes for mass deportations. The first vote of the meeting resulted in approval for a contract with CoreCivic to resume operating the facility, which was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with private detention facilities. Noeman, an Egyptian-American immigrant and a longtime business owner in the town, called turning the closed prison over to CoreCivic and ICE a “win-win situation,” which led to a cascade of loud boos. “It's nothing personal about any immigrant,” Noeman said, adding moments later that “to give jobs to the people is what I'm looking for.” At times, Noeman argued with attendees, questioning whether they actually live in Mason and telling them “you don't know what you're talking about.” Before the meeting, board member Virginia Rivers told The Associated Press that she does not support turning the prison into an ICE facility because “I don't like what ICE stands for, how they treat the people.” During the meeting, she noted that some immigrants without criminal records are being swept up by immigration agents and separated from their families. She said approving the contracts would make Mason “complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.” “We as officials of the town of Mason that were elected by the citizens should consider the consequences and the hurt that this would cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools and many families,” Rivers said. CoreCivic said in a statement that the ICE facility would create nearly 240 new jobs, and it is currently advertising openings for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour. The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company said. “The services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,” CoreCivic said. “How is it that we can consistently let these organizations come into Black communities and then just somehow overwhelm us with the few dollars that they throw on the table as crumbs while they take the majority of the take back to wherever they came from?” Watkins said. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment — including at least 22 inmate deaths — at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.

A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and actor Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood “ambassadors” earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term.

Article: An American paediatrician who volunteered in the Gaza Strip says the injuries inflicted on Palestinian aid seekers at sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) suggest that Israeli forces there shot the men and boys deliberately, by targeting and maiming specific body parts on specific days. Ahmed Yousaf made the comments to Al Jazeera from the Jordanian capital, Amman, on Tuesday, hours after returning from Gaza, where he had spent two and a half weeks working at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Deir el-Balah and al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. “Meaning on a given day, say Monday, we’d get 40,60 patients coming in at a given time, and they would all be shot in the legs, or in the pelvic area, or the groin on a given day, just kind of a similar pattern. And what it felt like, at least for me, the position that I went with, was that somebody behind the gun that day was going to choose the way they were either going to maim or decide to kill people,” he said. “It was age indiscriminate.” Yousaf’s comments are the latest by medical staff in Gaza that accuse Israeli forces and US contractors of targeted and indiscriminate violence at the GHF sites. Advertisement Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said last week that the GHF-run food distributions in famine-stricken Gaza have become sites of “orchestrated killing and dehumanisation“, while Human Rights Watch said the shootings amount to serious violations of international law and war crimes. ‘All of Gaza is a death trap’ Yousaf, the US paediatrician, said the victims at the sites were mainly boys and young men, as they are often the ones taking the risk to try to get food for their families, “given the dynamic of the risk associated with trying to carry a 5-pound [2.3kg] bag of flour, maybe kilometres, sometimes”. It seemed quite obvious to them and to us, from a pattern-recognition perspective, in terms of who came to the ER [emergency room], that on a given day, whoever was making the decision behind the trigger was choosing a very specific pattern of fire,” he said. “And this resulted in a situation in which, when those patients came in, in different stages of dying, screaming in pain for their mothers… we knew that in any other environment, we could have done something for them, but in the environment of Gaza, in the death trap that is Gaza completely, we were unable to give them the aid that they deserve, to provide the human dignity and humanity that they deserve.”

Article: It was something else." One of Mohamed Salah's first coaches is opening the all-new dark green gates of the youth centre in Nagrig, a village about three hours north of Cairo. It was on the streets of Nagrig where a seven-year-old Salah, external would play football with his friends, pretending to be Brazil striker Ronaldo, France's legendary playmaker Zinedine Zidane or Italian maestro Francesco Totti. "Mohamed was small compared to his team-mates, but he was doing things even the older boys couldn't manage," Ghamry Abd El-Hamid El-Saadany says as he points to the artificial pitch which is now named in Salah's honour. "His shots were incredibly powerful, and it was obvious that he had determination and drive." Salah, 33, is about to embark on his ninth season at Liverpool, where the winger has scored a remarkable 245 goals in 402 league and cup appearances since joining in 2017. With the Africa Cup of Nations in December and the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, BBC Sport visited Egypt to discover what Salah means to the people of the football-mad country of 115 million, and how a small boy from humble beginnings became a national icon.

Article: During earnings calls last week, executives with the firms Geo Group and CoreCivic announced an increase in revenue from new and current contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and discussed their plans to expand their businesses to meet the administration's demands. "We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions." CoreCivic reported a total revenue of $538.2 million during their second quarter, a 9.8% increase from the same quarter in 2024. During the call, Hininger told investors the company is evaluating additional opportunities for expansion and said that CoreCivic facilities are "the most humane, most efficient logistically, have the highest audit compliance scores in their system, and are more secure [and] weatherproof." Hininger said that while ICE has recently been using "soft-sided solutions" like the tent facilities at Guantanamo Bay and at Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, he believes the agency "does not see soft-sided facilities as long-term solutions." "In the days since the election, the message has been pretty darn clear from the administration, DHS leadership, and ICE leadership that detention is going to be the priority," Hininger said, adding that the company has been "working around the clock" to open up bed space and new detention facilities. During their earnings call last week, Geo Group Chairman George Zoley said the utilization of their current ICE contracts increased from 15,000 beds to 20,000 beds, which Zoley said is the highest level of ICE utilization in the company's history. The Geo Group CEO told investors that "given the size" of the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S., the company's view is that in addition to increased detention capacity, the "enforcement of federal immigration laws" could lead to an increase in GPS tracking for individuals. "We believe we've taken the necessary resources to significantly and quickly respond to the eventual expansion of [the] Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (ISAP)." ICE has for years relied on private companies to house detained migrants, making it a multimillion-dollar business. As ABC News has previously reported, Geo Group and CoreCivic --- both of whose leadership have long supported Trump --- saw their stock prices immediately spike after Trump's victory in the November election.

Trump has said any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" and it is believed one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands is that Kyiv surrenders the parts of the Donbas it still controls. A Russian summer offensive has been progressing with troops making a sudden thrust near the eastern town of Dobropillia and advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time. While downplaying Russia's advance, Zelensky said it was "clear to us" that Moscow's objective was to create a "certain information space" before Putin meets Trump that "Russia is moving forward, advancing, while Ukraine is losing". Moscow now holds almost all of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk but speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would reject any proposal to leave the Donbas. Zelensky has previously insisted that Ukrainians would not "gift their land to the occupier", and pointed to the country's constitution, which requires a referendum before a change in its territory. Last week, Trump said there would be "some swapping of territories to the betterment of both" Russia and Ukraine - sparking concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Moscow could be allowed to redraw Ukraine's borders by force.

Nicholas Rossi is alleged to have attacked the woman at his apartment in Orem, Utah, in September 2008 after she went to retrieve money he stole from her to buy a computer. The second day of a trial covering the Salt Lake County assault on a woman, known as MB, is taking place at the Third Judicial District Court in Salt Lake County. She said she spent time at Rossi's apartment in Orem, about 40 miles (66km) from Salt Lake City, and sometimes slept there during the day as she had a job working at night. She told the court on one occasion, she woke up at Rossi's apartment to find he had spent up to $400 (£296) on a computer using her credit card details without permission. 'Belittling' The relationship ended after about four weeks at the start of September 2008, which the woman put down to Rossi's "belittling" of her and suggesting she needed "mental help". She said he then began performing a sex act on himself and when she tried to leave, Rossi pulled her clothing down and pinned her to a couch or other piece of furniture before raping her. In it, Rossi alleged the woman had, on six to eight occasions, "forced him down and kissed him regardless of him saying 'no'." He also claimed the woman would force him to have sexual intercourse and "forcefully engage him into sexual acts" under the guise of "getting her money back".

Article: This week, I look at how the World Robot Conference put China's ambitions for humanoid robots on full display, even as engineers and investors acknowledge that integrating them into everyday life is still a distant prospect. BEIJING, CHINA - AUGUST 10: Unitree Robotics robots humanoid robots compete in a boxing match during the 2025 World Robot Conference (WRC) at Beiren Yichuang International Convention and Exhibition Center on August 10, 2025 in Beijing, China. At the World Robot Conference in Beijing, which concluded Tuesday, the mood was a blend of optimism and caution: Businesses showed off increasingly lifelike humanoid robots even as they conceded that technological gaps keeping these machines from mainstream usage remain wide. Some tasks like using a robot to make a bed are still in the "very early" stage, with low success rate, Huang said, "but that's the right direction to push the industry forward." Take PsiBot's mahjong-playing droid displayed at the event: It still misidentifies tiles, often confuses the game's rules and plays at a relatively slow pace, according to local media reports. The technological bottleneck for large-scale integration of humanoids into daily life stems from a lack of cutting-edge AI models and insufficient training data, said Bob Chen, economist at Shanghai-based FG Venture. players seem to shoot for the holy-grail solution." In robot manufacturing, Tesla's humanoid project Optimus appears to be leading in the U.S., with CEO Elon Musk saying the company plans to produce about 5,000 units this year. While Musk's ambitious plans could give it a leg up on other American competitors that have yet to hit the mass market, Chinese companies have been racing to make their models more affordable. In the lead up to the WRC, Unitree rolled out its third version of R1 model, priced at 39,900 yuan ($5,249) on e-commerce site JD.com, significantly cheaper than the its other models. At the conference, prices for a humanoid robot ranged from tens of thousands of yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and the high-end models capable of more complex tasks were priced above 500,000 yuan. China already has an edge in integrating machinery into factory workflows and, in many cases, is outpacing rivals in marrying artificial intelligence with robotics, said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of China-focused economic research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. Kroeber predicts that within two to four years, Chinese factories will achieve major efficiency gains across industries by combining top-tier industrial robots with AI systems that make them far more effective in varied settings. Some of UBTech Robotics' humanlike droids have been deployed at factories of carmakers BYD and Geely, at electronics manufacturer Foxconn and logistics giant SF Delivery, Chinese state media reported in April.

Single mum Roxanne Freeman says she lived beyond her means and used her credit cards to support her family, even using one to put down a deposit on a caravan. She had racked up £13,000 worth of debt by summer 2023, but her fortunes changed after she turned her hand to content creation, filming and posting reviews of plus-size clothing on TikTok. Roxanne is among a growing number of people turning to social media to boost their income and says: "It's literally life-changing." Roxanne says she can now afford to do more with her sons Roxanne was working as a Slimming World consultant when she bought a dress from TikTok Shop and filmed herself trying it on before posting a review for her 1,000 followers in February 2024. She says she earned £200 in commission from the dress manufacturer in a week - 10% for each one bought via the link she posted with her video - and was soon approached by other companies offering her samples to review. "I'm now earning up to £5,000 per month from just two to three hours' work a day, it's insane." 'Imposter syndrome' Roxanne, who now has almost 50,000 followers, has since left her slimming consultant job and relies solely on her income from TikTok. She says her earnings vary each month depending on her followers, but she has earned enough to pay off her debts and to do more with her sons, aged six and 10. "Sometimes imposter syndrome does sneak in a little bit and I worry, but you could lose any job tomorrow." Holly and Diego Hernandez's TikTok account has almost 300,000 followers Like Roxanne, married couple Holly and Diego Hernandez also earn money by posting videos on TikTok. Holly, from Leicester, and Diego, from Mexico, met on the social media platform when they were 16 and went on to set up an account to document their relationship and daily life. The couple now have almost 300,000 followers and earn up to £5,000 a month, but they have both kept their day jobs - Holly, 22, is a nurse and Diego, 23, works for a medical supply company. To be eligible, creators must be 18 or older, have 10,000 followers or more and have had at least 100,000 video views in the 30 days before applying to join the fund. Diego and Holly have both kept their day jobs Holly says: "We were so young when the money came in, and we were going on amazing holidays and buying things. "Things like taxes came into play, so we ended up getting an accountant and becoming a limited company." The couple post videos most days but admit there are negatives to sharing their lives so openly. "It can get to you when it's constant."

The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that still it controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Trump has also routinely threatened and cajoled his NATO allies over defense spending, and has shown little mercy in trade talks by hiking tariffs on most EU imports to 5%, ostensibly for U.S.

Article: (COMBO) This combination of pictures created on February 21, 2020 shows US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 19, 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a ceremony in Jerusalem on January 23, 2020 commemorating the people of Leningrad during the Second World War Nazi siege on the city. President Donald Trump will approach his encounter with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as a "listening exercise," the White House said, taming expectations that this week's Alaska summit could yield a deal to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "And so this is for the president to go and, again, to get a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end." The shift to downplaying the Friday meeting between the two heads of state — which will take place at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, according to NBC News reporting — takes place as Russia has deepened its advance in eastern Ukraine, in a likely bid for battlefield leverage ahead of negotiations. Moscow has persisted on a set of maximalist conditions to cease the devastating war in Ukraine, including the retainment of occupied territories, Kyiv's renunciation of its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and fresh elections in the invaded country. Concerns have been growing in Kyiv and among its European allies that an increasingly frustrated Trump, who has criticized both Russia and Ukraine over the course of the U.S.-brokered discussions, could push through peace at the price of territorial concessions. Trump on Monday circulated the notion of "land swapping" between the parties at war, although it remains unclear what Russian territories would be affected as part of this exercise, given Kyiv's lack of land gains. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected the possibility of surrendering ground — with the European Union likewise touting the need to respect "territorial integrity" — and has insisted that Kyiv should be included in peace conversations aiming for a final outcome. "So the conversation between Putin and Trump may be important for their bilateral track, but they cannot agree on anything about Ukraine without us." Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas lambasted Putin as "just pretending to negotiate" and stressed the Kremlin leader "doesn't want Zelenskyy around that table, because that would reveal that he actually doesn't want to negotiate, and he just wants to have a picture with President Trump and also postpone sanctions." Benjamin Godwin, partner at PRISM Strategic Intelligence, on Wednesday told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" that the premise of land swapping had diminished the odds of success of the Alaska summit. "I think this all comes down to the fact that the entire basis for this meeting is based on something that is totally impossible for both the Ukrainians and the Europeans and really, the Americans to agree to," he said. "So what you see from Karolin Leavitt is really the White House reeling back and back and back these expectations in the days leading up to the meeting." He noted that the best outcome for Ukraine would involve Putin overstepping the mark by way of excessive demands and kindling further frustration at the White House. It seems very difficult." The White House has signaled but so far resisted the impulse to directly confront the Kremlin by way of further sanctions, instead opting to apply pressure on Moscow's lingering trade partners.

"We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism," ministers of the three countries — using an acronym that describes the European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal — said in a letter obtained by the FT. They were designed to act as a guardrail: if Iran commits a "significant non-performance" of the deal, any of the JCPOA signatory countries can trigger the automatic reimposition of U.N. Those sanctions are set to expire on October 18 unless one of the remaining parties of the deal — Russia, China, or a member of the E3 — triggers the snapback option. "'Snapback' looks set to be the word of the summer in European negotiations with Iran," Ellie Geranmayeh, Deputy Director, Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a July report.

Article: Israel is in discussions with South Sudan about forcibly relocating Palestinians from Gaza to the East African country, according to six people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press. The proposal is part of an Israeli effort to displace Palestinians from Gaza – a move human rights groups warn would amount to forcible expulsion, ethnic cleansing, and would violate international law. Critics of the transfer plan fear Palestinians would never be allowed to return to Gaza and that mass departure could pave the way for Israel to annex the enclave and re-establish Israeli settlements there, as called for by far-right ministers in the Israeli government. South Sudan has struggled to recover from a civil war that broke out shortly after independence in 2011, killing nearly 400,000 people and leaving parts of the country facing famine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said he wants to advance what he calls “voluntary migration” for much of Gaza’s population, a policy he has linked to previous statements of United States President Donald Trump. “I think that the right thing to do, even according to the laws of war as I know them, is to allow the population to leave, and then you go in with all your might against the enemy who remains there,” Netanyahu said Tuesday in an interview with i24, an Israeli TV station. South Sudanese civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AP that the country “should not become a dumping ground for people … and it should not accept to take people as negotiating chips to improve relations”. According to Szlavik, the country wants the Trump administration to lift a travel ban and remove sanctions on some South Sudanese elites, suggesting the US could be involved in any agreement about the forcible displacement of Palestinians. The Trump administration has previously pressured several countries to accept deportations, and South Sudan has already taken in eight individuals removed from the US under the administration’s mass deportation policy.

Article: (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo next week before flying to Washington for a summit with President Donald Trump, underscoring how Trump’s push to reset global trade is drawing the often-feuding neighbors closer. Lee and Ishiba previously met on the sidelines of the June G7 meetings in Canada, where they called for building a future-oriented relationship and agreed to cooperate closely on various issues including trade and countering North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. South Korea’s previous conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, made active efforts to repair ties with Tokyo, including a major compromise on compensation issues related to Korean victims of Japanese wartime slavery, aiming to bolster trilateral security cooperation with Washington against North Korean threats. But Yoon’s presidency was cut short by his brief imposition of martial law in December, which led to his ouster and imprisonment, leaving uncertainty over Seoul-Tokyo relations under Lee, who has long accused Japan of clinging to its imperialist past and hindering cooperation. Since taking office in June after winning the early presidential election, Lee has avoided thorny remarks about Japan, instead promoting pragmatism in foreign policy and pledging to strengthen Seoul’s alliance with Washington and trilateral cooperation with Tokyo. There also have been calls in South Korea to boost collaboration with Japan in responding to Trump, who has unsettled allies and partners with tariff hikes and demands they reduce reliance on the U.S.

The Nikkei 225 rose above 43,421 points on Wednesday after better-than-expected US inflation data bolstered the case for a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve at its next committee meeting in September.

The inflation data added to a positive turn in investor sentiment following US President Donald Trump’s announcement on Monday of a 90-day extension of his pause on crippling tariffs on Chinese goods.

Article: In an era in which technology has encroached on every aspect of umpiring — replay review, near-daily lowlight videos of bad calls going viral, and now, MLB's automated-ball-strike system that calculates the location of a pitch to within a fraction of an inch — the pressure on umpires is higher than ever, MLB officials say. That's the most important thing." toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR A day at umpire camp The pool of hopefuls in this camp ran the demographic gamut: mostly — but not all — men, of all ages, skin colors, hometowns and experience levels. But more than anything, O'Connor said, getting the little things right can help an umpire project what he called "field presence." Sponsor Message "You got to look like you know what you're doing," O'Connor told them. "Those two dugouts, you've got to prove to them you know what you're doing." toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR How technology is changing umpiring Dealing with pressure has always been part of an umpire's job. "The umpiring now is better than it ever has been by a mile," said Jim Reynolds, an MLB umpire supervisor who worked the major leagues for 24 years, including two World Series. Now, what might be the biggest change for major league umpires is on deck: MLB is testing a camera-based system known as ABS, or automated ball-strike, that can tell instantly whether a pitch is in the strike zone. toggle caption Becky Sullivan/NPR An ABS challenge system could be coming to the big leagues before long, in which players will be able to challenge balls and strikes when they disagree with the umpire's call. Sponsor Message "When you walk on a big league field — I don't care if you're a player, an umpire or a coach — confidence is the most important thing. One of the things we're going to have to monitor with our guys, and one of the things they're going to have to overcome, is this eroding of confidence in real time," Reynolds said. It has already changed MLB's umpire development process, said Cris Jones, who supervises umpires in Triple-A, the highest level of the minor leagues, where ABS has been in testing for several years. Now, they must also recover from getting their calls overturned — especially with the ABS challenge system, where there can sometimes be 10 or more challenges in a single game, because teams can challenge as many calls as they like so long as they are successful in overturning the umpire's calls. "The mental part is what I'm afraid of with some of these umpires that get overturned, and the frequency that they get overturned, or the frequency that they get challenged." At spring training earlier this year, players described to NPR what it was like when that happened. But I also think that the goal of this profession is to be perfect, so we should want to be perfect anyway," said Leo Dlatt, 21, who came from the Chicago area to attend the camp. He alluded to this year's All-Star Game, during which the ABS challenge system was in effect and was used in the first inning to turn a 1-2 ball call into a 0-3 strikeout.

They're really lovely." Sponsor Message But here was the conundrum: Certain genes suggested that potatoes were more closely related to tomatoes, while other genes gave the impression that potatoes and Etuberosum had the closer relationship. "When something doesn't quite fall out right, that's where the exciting biology is." In a paper in the journal Cell , Knapp and her colleagues suggest the reason for the confusion was due to an ancient interbreeding event between the ancestors of tomatoes and Etuberosum that gave rise to the potato lineage. "So all of the potatoes that we eat," she continues, "the ones that are red, the ones that are little like this, the big ones, the ones we make into chips, all of those are one species we've domesticated that's gone worldwide." That species originated in the Americas, where today there are 107 wild species. toggle caption Natural History Museum, London "They're a way for a plant to store starch," Knapp says, "and, in a way, persist through seasons which are not good for growing." Sponsor Message The perplexing thing is that neither tomatoes nor Etuberosum — the potato's closest relatives — have tubers. student at Huazhong Agricultural University and a lead author of the paper, because this is how a whole new plant lineage came to be and how the ancestor of modern-day potatoes was born. And we're quite lucky in this case that this one worked … 'cause otherwise we wouldn't have potatoes." Conquest of the Americas by tuber In another experiment, when the researchers took potato plants and knocked out one key gene that came from the tomato, or another key gene that came from Etuberosum, the potato struggled to make its characteristic tubers. "If there's a plant that can invade and take advantage, then off it goes." The potato's successful exploitation of the alpine habitat was likely made possible by its tubers, which could store energy and persist in the newly made mountains, biding their time until the conditions become more favorable. "And you can generate more species to adapt [to] changeable environments." Knapp adds, "Hybridization is a real force in evolution that allows for the release of variation, which allows diversification and evolution to happen." Of course, not all interbreeding events have produced results as wildly successful as the potato.

While she has gone by a series of shifting titles involving the designation "senior adviser," an official agency record recently called Lake the "Acting Chief Executive Officer" of Voice of America's federal parent, the U.S. A government role has to be "defined and documented" Although the question of what job Lake holds may seem a bit in the weeds, it could have ramifications for the legality of the decisions she has made in leading the agency. "The government does not operate on the whims of a Kari Lake or even of a Donald Trump," says Norman Eisen, who served as special counsel for ethics to then-President Barack Obama. Eisen, an attorney who is the co-founder of Democracy Defenders Fund, is representing press advocacy groups in current lawsuits against Lake over the actions she has taken at Voice of America. One way or the other, this raises the most profound legal questions." In an earlier case, a federal judge voided directives tightening asylum rules in 2020 after finding that Trump's appointment of the acting director of U.S. There's so many things that may come back to haunt Kari Lake and USAGM." "Maybe she just wants to have a cool title to wave around," Turner says, "but if she really doesn't have true legal authority to have that title, then they're really just begging for problems." Unclear that Lake is eligible to be acting CEO Lake is a former local Phoenix television news anchor turned two-time unsuccessful MAGA candidate for senator and governor in Arizona. In March, Lake named a senior agency official, Victor Morales, to be the acting chief executive; in early July, according to two people with knowledge, she was elevated to be deputy CEO but continued to run the agency. (They spoke on condition of anonymity due to fears of professional repercussions.) She then forced Morales out in late July, which is when she began to be referred to as acting CEO both inside and outside the vastly diminished agency. Sponsor Message The federally funded international broadcaster has — until this year — broadcast news in 49 languages, reaching lands where a free press is either under duress from authorities or not financially viable. Lake identified as acting CEO on TV appearance and in official document Yet that's how the right-wing cable channel Real America's Voice identified Lake in a July 31 segment she posted Sunday on her own YouTube page. 1, the agency itself called her the "Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM" twice in a letter to Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz informing him that it intended to fire him. The judge is overseeing a group of related lawsuits against Lake and the government filed by Abramowitz as well as other Voice of America journalists, an agency official, unions and press advocacy groups. (Abramowitz's attorney declined to comment.) Under federal statute, the Voice of America director "may only be appointed or removed if such action has been approved by a majority vote" of the advisory board. Justice Department wrote that the administration had the power to dismiss Abramowitz for previously refusing to accept a transfer to a shortwave radio facility in North Carolina from the network's headquarters in Washington, D.C. "This would create an additional argument for anybody she fired or any other acts she engaged in, including entering into contracts." A revolving door of chief executives as Lake oversees agency Then-President Joe Biden's CEO, Amanda Bennett, resigned on the day of Trump's second inauguration in January. (Bozell has instead been nominated to be Trump's ambassador to South Africa.) Sponsor Message Initially, the agency's chief financial officer, Roman Napoli, served as acting chief executive, followed by Morales in March. Until late July, Lake's own title was "senior adviser" — though, as NPR has previously reported, it has variously been rendered as senior adviser for the administration, for the agency, for the agency's chief operating officer (a position the agency does not currently have) and, in a court filing in late June, "senior advisor to the acting CEO." The government's legal filings on Wednesday in response to Judge Lamberth's demand for more information from Lake about her plans for Voice of America may shed more light on what job she has.

Article: "The most everyday, commonplace words are often the most mysterious," said Colin Gorrie, a linguist who has written about the origin of "dog." Descended from wolves, dogs were among the first animals to be domesticated, and their close bond with humans can be traced back thousands of years. Much like the animal itself, the word used to describe canines has evolved over time; "dog" only became the standard term within the past 500 years or so, according to Gorrie. "I think what the source of it is — is the fact that dogs live with us so much and we have such an emotional association with dogs, they become parts of our family and they attract these kinds of pet names." From insult to standard pet name Centuries ago, dogs were more commonly called "hounds" — a term derived from the Old English word "hund." Today, "hound" typically refers to a specific breed of dog, but back then, it referred to all domestic canines, according to Gorrie. "So not just in the history of English but in related languages of Europe and Asia." Over time, the positive emotions people felt toward the four-legged creature eclipsed some of the word's negative, derogatory charge, he said. " Almost as if they're reclaiming that word or using it ironically to show just how strong the affection is." Since "dog" became ubiquitous, it has continued to broaden in meaning. That's also true for common words such as "boy" and "she," as well as animal-related ones like "pig" and "hog." " There are theories about some of them," Gorrie said. "But dog is the one that's the real mystery." Why dogs are a popular source for idioms The term "dog" has also borne a range of sayings, such as "dog days of summer," "dog-eat-dog world," and "raining cats and dogs." People tend to use what's ordinary in their day-to-day lives as sources of metaphors and idioms. The same goes for "dog tag." " Sometimes we put on a dog a collar so that we know who it belongs to so that it can be taken back to the right person," he said. "Well, if you go in the military, you wear a little collar like a dog does, and we call them dog tags." Nilsen added that many of these idioms stem from humans' close observations of dogs' behavior and mannerisms — showing just how close the two are.

Sponsor Message The Chelmsford Immigration Court opened last year as a way to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court, which used to process immigration cases for much of New England.

Boston is an immigration hotspot The Chelmsford court is part of a region already feeling pressure from not having enough immigration judges. It's one of 18 cities the Department of Homeland Security recently labeled a "sanctuary jurisdiction" that "impede enforcement of federal immigration laws."

Leaving thousands of cases behind Former Judge Angela Munro received the email in April notifying her that her employment would be terminated and placed on administrative leave — just a few days shy of the end of her two-year probationary period. "But I also knew in my mind that I was doing a good job and that immigration judges are supposedly needed." Munro had about 4,000 cases on her docket, she said, and had completed about 1,000. "Any immigration judge can hear any case at any time, and adjudicating detained immigration cases remains a high priority for the agency," Mattingly, the EOIR spokesperson, said in response to questions about judges being moved. toggle caption Brian Snyder/REUTERS Backlogs grow as EOIR dismisses judges As more people have been placed in detention, and judges have been dismissed, EOIR has strained with the pressure of keeping up with cases. Sponsor Message Griffiths, the judge who moved from Phoenix, noted that her own docket included pending cases from 2013 that over the years had bounced from one judge to another. The most recent judicial terminations came after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that immediately allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including for hiring more immigration judges. "Pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment," according to the emails shared with NPR. He listened to cases until his last day but had been expecting the termination notice since the April round of firings — and had already cleared out his office in preparation.

Article: With midterms more than a year away, a record number of lawmakers are eyeing the exits toggle caption Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images Since President Trump returned to the White House this year, a record number of members are eyeing the exits as the Republican-led Congress has largely ceded its power to Trump's vision of the country. With just under 15 months to go until the 2026 midterms, nine Senators and 21 House members have announced they don't plan to run for reelection, each a modern record for this point before the election, according to an NPR analysis of Congressional campaign data since 2017. 12, 2025, there will be 470 Congressional seats on the ballot in 2026: all 435 House seats, 33 regularly-scheduled Senate contests and two special elections to fill the remainder of Senate terms in Ohio and Florida. Sponsor Message Digging into the data of Congressional retirements and relocations over the last decade since Trump first took office in 2017, this year's midterm cycle is notable, too, for the surge in members of Congress looking to leave Washington and serve as governor of their state. Jessica Taylor, the Senate and Governors editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said this cycle's inversion of the typical governor-to-Senate pipeline is the highest the country has seen in at least 90 years. "The Senate used to be the world's greatest deliberative body, but a lot of those people that worked across the aisle have retired or been defeated." It's also a move that carries a high degree of success. According to Ballotpedia's research, 10 of 14 incumbent or ex-senators have won their gubernatorial campaigns in the last 40 years, compared to 27 of 56 governors who ran for Senate. Sponsor Message This year, it's also notable to look at governors who have opted not to run for Senate in key races, like popular Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire. Some of these figures may have eyes towards the wide-open 2028 presidential primaries on both sides of the aisle as reasons to avoid running for Senate, Taylor adds, "but there's no doubt that just Washington is a less attractive place than it was a few decades ago." On the House side so far, there are nine Representatives, five Democrats and four Republicans, looking to make the jump to the Senate, also higher than some recent election cycles. Taylor said another reason some members of Congress might be choosing to run for governor is to raise their political profile in a way that holding that position might not have in the past. I think after COVID, more people are paying attention to governors." Departures keep growing in the Trump era toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Of the 535 lawmakers that were in the 115th Congress that coincided with the start of Trump's first term in 2017, just over half are no longer in office. Seventy-five members of Congress joined some time after 2017 and are no longer there, including several placeholder members who were appointed to hold vacant seats until the next election, lawmakers drawn out of their seats in the latest round of redistricting and more controversial figures like the expelled former Rep. There are lawmakers who resigned to join a new presidential administration, like former Oklahoma Republican Senator-turned-NASA-administrator Jim Bridenstine, who served in Trump's first term, former Senators-turned-vice presidents Kamala Harris and JD Vance and former Florida Sen. The most common form of departure for members of Congress in the Trump era by and large has been retirement, followed by losing in the general election, running for a different office or getting ousted in a primary. Taylor says there are two big reasons that lawmakers might want to leave Washington nowadays: having a life beyond Congress and because of the additional scrutiny on the age and performance of older lawmakers, exacerbated by questions about former President Biden's health during the 2024 election. So far this year, the president's push to exert power over Congress, its budgetary authority and other changes may entice Republicans who aren't fully on board to hang up their hat, Cook Political Report's Jessica Taylor said. "And I do think, there's a fight within the Republican Party that if you are more of a moderate, continually having to bump up against Trump and his allies is exhausting." Sponsor Message The August recess for the House and Senate is a time when lawmakers return home to their districts and get a taste of what their constituents – and polling data – says about the popularity of the current administration and how much of an uphill battle they could face in a re-election campaign.

Article: High prices and healthcare costs may turn Latino voters away from Republicans in 2026 toggle caption Allison Dinner/AFP via Getty Images Support for President Trump and his party is starting to wane among Latino voters. According to Equis Research, a Latino polling organization, about a third of Latinos who supported Trump last year "are not set on voting for a Republican" during next year's midterms. Caitlin Jury, a research director at Equis Research, told NPR that economic issues such as persistently high prices on groceries are driving many Latino voters, who were key in getting Trump elected in November, away from the party. "And if they want to retain any gains they may have made among Latino voters, they need to be sure to deliver on the promises they made that maybe gave them some additional support in the last election." Sponsor Message Daniel Garza, president of the Libre Initiative – a group that mobilized Latino voters on economic issues to support conservative candidates, said many Latinos are not satisfied with the current economy. "Folks aren't getting good paying jobs, wage growth, checks on inflation, affordable health care and housing and quality education." But, Garza said, it's only been six months and he is optimistic that most Latinos who voted for Republican candidates will be patient. "And I think there is a patience with this administration for their reforms … and the changes that they put into place to take effect." Melissa Morales, the founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, a left-leaning Latino voter mobilization organization, said her group's polling has found that pessimism about the economy among Latino voters since Trump took office is only growing at this point. "So we do expect to see some movement one way or the other." As of now, Latinos have a lot of dissatisfaction with how Republican lawmakers are handling their most important issue. economy today as poor (64%), including nearly a third who say it is very poor (32%)." A majority of voters (56%) also reported feeling that the economy was only getting worse under Trump. "We're going to be watching that." What this means for Democrats toggle caption Rebecca Noble/AFP via Getty Images This growing discontent with Republicans hasn't directly translated into support for Democrats, though. "What we're seeing here is certainly a rising cynicism towards both parties," Equis Research's Caitlin Jury said, "especially among some key swing voters." Jury said her group found an increase in people reporting that they were unsure what party they will support in next year's midterm elections – including among "Biden defectors," defined as voters who cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024 – as well as Trump voters writ large. Sponsor Message "So, these are folks who were telling us they were set on voting for a Republican when we talked to them earlier this year in May," she said. So, [there is] movement away from Republicans, but not quite yet towards Democrats." Jury said if Democrats want to win over some of these voters by next year, they "need to offer Latinos a proactive vision" for dealing with many of their concerns. He said a lot of Latinos don't like the direction of the party in the past few years, "The optics, the narratives, the actual policies that are being passed, all favor Republicans at this point," he argued. Morales said the disillusionment and dissatisfaction among Latino voters, including among many people who voted Trump, does actually give a significant opportunity for Democrats to change course and provide a "sweeping economic vision." It could provide an alternative to Trump's less popular economic policies like tariffs and tax cuts favoring billionaires.

"Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services," Leavitt said during a press briefing, when asked by NPR about the expanding crackdown. "If they refuse, they will be subjected to fines or jail time." toggle caption Maansi Srivastava/NPR According to Leavitt, Metropolitan police and federal law enforcement agents in Washington will strictly enforce existing laws that force homeless people off the city's streets as part of an effort to "make DC safe and beautiful."

I'm pretty well a quiet person." But Donald Whitehead, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said he feared many of the city's homeless residents will wind up displaced and incarcerated. "There is a fear this may be similar to what's happened to people rounded up due to their immigration status," Whitehead said, pointing to detention camps that have sprung up around the country. That could lead to a lot of very bad outcomes including death." More pressure, fewer services Experts also voiced concern about efforts to pressure people living with addiction into treatment at a time when there aren't enough recovery facilities capable of treating the complex health issues that stem from use of fentanyl, methamphetamines and other toxic street drugs. "They're people who happen to have an illness that can be devastating." In recent months, the Trump administration has slashed funding for addiction research and treatment grants, while also sharply reducing Medicaid insurance spending that many people with substance use disorder rely upon. "I wish they would stop treating homeless people like we're dogs and like we're all addicts." toggle caption Maansi Srivastava/NPR According to Leavitt, roughly 70 homeless camps in Washington have already been broken up since March by federal authorities.

Oliva and others interviewed by NPR said Trump is tapping into real frustration among Americans that the number of people living on the streets and in tent camps keeps growing.

Article: As the Guadalupe River overflowed in Kerr County on the Fourth of July, officials with a local agency charged with "managing water quality and water quantity" in the Texas Hill Country appeared perplexed by the extent of the unfolding crisis and their role in addressing it, according to emails and text messages obtained by ABC News. -- including a screenshot of a graph showing a massive increase in streamflow levels along the river in Kerrville -- following drought conditions that Kerr County had faced prior to the flooding. It's terrible." By that time, parts of Kerr County had already been inundated with floodwaters for several hours, flood alerts had been issued, and the Kerrville Police Department had received calls for multiple water rescues. "And so many people here in RVs for the 4th." Flood waters left debris including vehicles and equipment scattered in Louise Hays Park on July 5, 2025, in Kerrville, Texas. Praise the lord." An individual identified as natural resources manager Shelby Taber responded, "Glad to hear camp mystic is all safe!" But by mid-afternoon, the UGRA's senior leadership appeared to realize the situation at Camp Mystic was more dire -- though they did not know specific details. We, however, need to be concerned that the county does not try to sieze [sic] control." Contacted by ABC News regarding the messages, officials with the UGRA did not respond to a request for comment. 'Vulnerable to flash floods' ABC News previously asked the UGRA for any flood after-action reports it may have created over the last 25 years following other storms along the Guadalupe River, but a law firm representing the authority said that they "have no responsive information." Documents released over the last month show that concerns over the risks posed by the Guadalupe River in Kerr County were widely known ahead of the Fourth of July floods, with the UGRA being particularly cognizant. As ABC News previously reported, the authority submitted an application last year to state officials seeking a $1 million grant from the Texas Flood Infrastructure Fund for a project called the "Kerr County Flood Warning System" that would have included "high water detection systems at 10 low water crossings." "Since 1932, approximately 35 lives have been lost in floods in Kerr County. However, in October 2024 the UGRA declined to continue applying for funding from the Infrastructure Fund, with Bushnoe writing in a letter at the time that although Kerr County was "vulnerable to flash foods," the project would have been "only eligible for a 5% grant." "We will continue to explore options to implement a Kerr County flood warning system and financial assistance opportunities," Bushnoe's letter said. The UGRA later reached an agreement with a company called Kisters to develop a different flood warning system that would have consisted of a "centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response." The agreement, which was signed exactly one month before the July 4 floods, indicated that the project was expected to cost more than $70,000. 'We'll be getting lots of calls' July 4 was supposed to be a day of celebration in Kerr County, with a major Independence Day fireworks event called "Fourth on the River" scheduled to take place just a stone's throw from the Guadalupe River. "Unfortunately it seems like it takes major loss of life to get the ball really rolling on it like Blanco 2015 did," an apparent reference to another flood a decade ago. "I have a feeling we'll be getting lots of calls from very angry people asking why we let this happen because they want someone to blame and I'm going to have no idea what to tell them," one official wrote at 7:21 a.m. "Some of the comments I'm seeing are saying things along the lines of 'how is there now [sic] flood warning system in 2025?'" an employee wrote to Linscomb early in the morning on July 5.

Article: National Guard, pressing federal agents into urban law enforcement and taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department — all in the name of fighting violent crime in the nation's capital — Trump invited Bowser to cooperate with his administration. "What I’m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have," Bowser told reporters after a Tuesday meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi. That's not to say Bowser is thrilled with the position she finds herself in, effectively handing over law enforcement in her city to a president with whom she has had a complicated relationship since his first term. During a videoconference with Washington, D.C., community leaders Tuesday evening, Bowser described Trump's maneuvers as an "authoritarian push." But on the whole, her response has been far more measured than those of Democrats — both in the D.C. "The Trump administration has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday. "We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate." In a Monday news conference announcing his assertion of power through an executive order, Trump called Bowser "a good person who has tried," adding that he acted because "she has been given many chances." As Bowser noted during a Monday news conference, the city and federal agencies have a long history of working together to plan, execute and protect special events in the city, including during both of Trump's terms. The two are also largely aligned on the goal of bringing the Washington Commanders back to the city from the Maryland suburbs, and Bowser attended a White House news conference on the topic in May. Park Police, were used to violently break up a peaceful demonstration outside Lafayette Square, just steps from the White House, clearing a path for Trump to walk to a nearby church to address the news media. In a letter to Trump in June 2020, before officers on horseback drove demonstrators away from the park, Bowser accused him of "inflaming" and "adding to the grievances" of protesters, creating a more dangerous dynamic. Bowser is at a disadvantage at a time when her administration is fighting to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in May that he would move "as quickly as possible" to fix what some Republicans said was a mistake in the drafting of the law. The Senate passed a change earlier this year, but the House, which is out of session for its August recess, has made no move toward sending it to the president for his signature. Beyond that, federal law plainly gives the president the power to assume control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department for up to 30 days at a time when he declares an emergency, as he did this week, and to activate the D.C. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that roughly 850 federal law enforcement officers and agents fanned out across the city Monday night and made 23 arrests on charges ranging from homicide and drug crimes to skipping out on a fare and reckless driving. Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland and president of the Democratic Mayors Association, said in an interview with NBC News that municipal leaders across the country are watching what's happening in Washington — on the heels of Trump activating the California National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles — with wary eyes. "I want to be very crystal clear about something: We do not want the National Guard in our cities.” Bibb also defended Bowser's handling of Trump's crackdown this week, pointing to the unusual situation Bowser finds herself in compared to leaders of other major cities. “She understands and recognizes that she’s in a unique position where there’s no real statehood in D.C., and her autonomy can be limited, but at the end of the day, she’s going to continue to do the job she’s been doing on reducing violent crime, with or without the support of Donald Trump,” he said.

Article: Medicare enrollees who buy the optional Part D drug benefit may see substantial premium price hikes — potentially up to $50 a month — when they shop for next year’s coverage. Such drug plans are used by millions of people who enroll in what is called original Medicare, the classic federal government program that began in 1965 and added a drug benefit only in 2006. Policy experts say premiums are likely to go up for several reasons, including increased use of some higher-cost prescription drugs; a law that capped out-of-pocket spending for enrollees; and changes in a program aimed at stabilizing price increases that the Trump administration has continued but made less generous. Spending by insurers and government programs for prescription drugs in 2024 across the market grew more than 10%, which is slightly greater than in recent years, according to a research report published last month in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. The Trump administration, according to The Washington Post, is considering a five-year pilot program in which Medicare Part D plans could voluntarily expand access to the drugs, which can cost more than $1,000 a month without insurance. That $2,000 cap is a big change from previous years, when people taking expensive drugs had a higher threshold to meet annually and were on the hook to pay 5% of the drug’s cost even after meeting that amount. “The Inflation Reduction Act was necessary to make Part D proper health insurance, but there’s a cost to do so.” While the cap is a big help for affected consumers, the reduced amounts paid by some beneficiaries — coupled with the cost shift to insurers — could lead plans to spread their increased expenses across all policyholders through higher premiums. A growing number of health plans have also begun to require enrollees to pay a percentage of a drug’s cost, rather than a flat-dollar copay, which can lead to larger-than-expected costs at the pharmacy counter, Dusetzina said. While consumers not currently taking high-cost specialty drugs may not see a benefit in the $2,000 cap initially, they might one day, say policy experts, who note that drugmaker prices continue to rise and that enrollees could fall ill with a condition like cancer or multiple sclerosis for which they need a very high-priced drug. “It’s important to think not just in context of those groups who hit the cap every year, but also people are paying more in premiums to protect their future selves as well,” said Casey Schwarz, the senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group. But those Medicare Advantage plans are not expected to increase the drug portion of their premiums, partly because the private sector plans are paid more per member than what it costs taxpayers for the traditional program. That means Advantage plans have far more money to add benefits, such as vision and dental coverage, which traditional Medicare does not include, or to use them to cushion the impact of rising spending on drug costs, thus limiting premium increases. The growing difference between premiums — fueled by the extra rebates flowing to the private sector plans — “is increasingly tilting coverage toward Medicare Advantage and making traditional Medicare plus a stand-alone PDP [prescription drug plan] unaffordable for many enrollees,” said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Trump administration reduced funding meant to slow premium growth The final factor in the premium increase equation is a program set up to slow the rise of premiums in stand-alone Part D plans. It began under the Biden administration to offset premium increases tied to changes in the Inflation Reduction Act by temporarily injecting additional federal dollars to help insurers adjust to the new rules. The average monthly premium for a stand-alone Part D drug plan dropped 9%, from $43 last year to $39 this year, according to KFF, even when factoring in that some plans raised prices by up to $35 a month, the maximum increase allowed under the stabilization plan for this year. A government official told The Wall Street Journal that the administration felt that keeping the full funding would have mainly benefited the insurers and cost taxpayers an “enormous, excess amount.” The stabilization effort next year will send $10 a month per enrollee to Part D insurers to help keep premiums in check, down from $15 this year. “We did see some plans this year were taking premium increases of that $35 amount in 2025, and I fully expect we will see some plans with increases up to $50 a month” next year, she said.

By contrast, his Bangladesh-sewn jeans, which are still made with 100% American cotton, sell for $40 a pair, nearly half the price of the U.S.-made version, but deliver far higher margins of 20%. According to a Conference Board survey released Monday, the appeal of “Made in USA” has faded since 2022, as many Americans now link it to higher costs amid higher price sensitivity. Among the top goals for Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with steep tariffs is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of short-term market and economic duress. become more expensive from tariffs, we can’t subsidize our American-made jeans as much and their price must go up, meaning fewer customers can afford Made-in-USA.” Clothing imports already faced tariffs of 12%-17% before Trump’s presidency, according to the United States Fashion Industry Association. In his 2025 Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, over 80% of apparel companies said they plan to diversify sourcing to offset tariffs, while just 17% expect to increase sourcing from the U.S. Aside from a handful of luxury brands, most U.S.-made apparel is limited to basic items like T-shirts, hoodies and socks, due to the fact that American factories “don’t have the skill set, machinery or materials to make anything beyond that,” Ng explained. Opened in 2019 during Trump’s first presidency, the luxury brand’s facility produces designer handbags but has a defect rate far higher than the industry norm, making it the company’s worst-performing facility, according to a report from Reuters.

Article: But in the last several weeks, the once-arcane subject of redistricting — underpinned by Texas Democrats’ extraordinary exodus from their state to block Republican plans to redraw maps — has transformed into the burning hot center of Democratic politics. This is breaking through … because of how ruthless people are seeing Republicans be, and they want to see their Democratic leaders fight just as hard,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic consultant who has worked on senatorial and presidential campaigns. “Any [Democratic] voter thinking about 2028 is mad right now, and they really want Democrats to stand up and fight back.” President Donald Trump elevated the issue to the national stage when he said he wanted Texas to carve up its congressional map to create up to five more Republican districts to protect the party's narrow House majority in the 2026 midterms. While both parties have gerrymandered their states’ congressional districts in the past, the move in Texas stands out because it seeks to rip up the state’s map mid-decade, rather than after the new census every 10 years. We could sit on the sidelines, talk about the way the world should be, or we can recognize the existential nature that is this moment.” In another escalation on the issue, Newsom declared Tuesday night that Trump had missed a deadline and so California would be “historic” and “end the Trump presidency,” he said in a social media post that mockingly emulated the kind of statement Trump would make. “If Trump and Texas Republicans won’t play by the rules, we will look at every option available to stop their extreme power grab, and nothing will be off the table.” Andrew O’Neill, the national advocacy director for the progressive grassroots group Indivisible, referred to some of the Democrats’ remarks and actions as “productive ambition.” “Democratic leadership amongst Democratic voters — it’s in the toilet right now. “So it’s all well and good that you put out a boring press release that says you believe in democracy and fair maps, but if you’re not actually taking the fight to Republicans and drawing that strategic conflict, in the attention economy we currently live with, nobody’s going to hear you.” Hosting Texas Democratic lawmakers in Illinois has given Pritzker a platform to play protector-in-chief, vowing to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants. “There’s no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that’s here visiting our state,” Pritzker said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” “So it’s a lot of grandstanding. For instance, a new Siena College poll found that Hochul's job approval and favorability ratings have ticked up since June as she has been front and center in the redistricting debate. “Every day, he says, ‘Man, you know, everybody’s coming up to me, telling me how proud they are of you and for the fact that they didn’t even know what redistricting was and now they know,’" Romero said.

Article: The administration’s assessment of human rights abuses in some countries, which is one-tenth as long as last year’s report, reaches notably different conclusions and dedicates no sections to abuses against women or LGBTQ people. “Never before have the reports gone this far in prioritizing an administration’s political agenda over a consistent and truthful accounting of human rights violations around the world — softening criticism in some countries while ignoring violations in others.” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce defended the administration’s version of the report, which U.S. “The Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,” Bruce said. “Individual reports are more readable, objective, true to their statutory origins, and more useful than ever before.” Europe In the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries, the Trump administration concluded that the human rights situation “worsened during the year,” citing restrictions on freedom of expression, as well as reports of “crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.” In Germany, the report found “limits on the speech of groups it deemed extremist.” In France, the State Department found “some limitations on freedom of speech.” And the assessment listed restrictions on political speech in the U.K. Asked by reporters about the Trump administration’s review of visa applicants' social media accounts, Bruce said: “We consider freedom of expression to be a foundational component of a functioning democracy. Societies are strengthened by free expression of opinion and government censorship is intolerable in a free society.” Brazil The human rights situation also declined in Brazil last year, the Trump administration concluded, citing court rulings that it called “broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom.” “The government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to ‘undermine democracy,’ disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees,” the report says. The report also criticizes Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who has overseen Bolsonaro’s court case, saying he “personally ordered the suspension of more than 100 user profiles on the social media platform X (formally twitter), disproportionately suppressing the speech of advocates of former president Jair Bolsonaro.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently sanctioned de Moraes, revoking U.S. The first group of Afrikaners from South Africa to arrive for resettlement listen to remarks by Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Troy Edgar after they arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Va., on May 12. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images file The report called the Expropriation Act, a law that attempts to address the disparity in land ownership between white and Black South Africans, “a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” The Trump Administration has publicly decried the law, which allows the South African government to expropriate land — in some cases without compensation — in instances where it is unused or there is a public interest in its redistribution. “The government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the report said, “including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.” El Salvador The report said that in El Salvador, which imprisoned hundreds of migrants from the United States at the request of the Trump administration, there were “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses.” But several Venezuelan migrants who had been imprisoned in El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison told NBC News they had experienced physical and psychological torture. It listed several significant human rights issues in the country, including credible reports of “unlawful or arbitrary killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by security forces and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.” The Trump administration’s report also removed the section on Indigenous peoples and made no mention of elections or political participation in El Salvador. Israel, the West Bank and Gaza The Trump administration’s reports on Israel, the West Bank and Gaza were also dramatically shorter and had significantly less documentation of abuses by the Israeli government, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas than the Biden administration report’s did last year. Khames Alrefi / Anadolu via Getty Images In assessing Israel, the Trump administration cited reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, enforced disappearance and degrading treatment of Palestinians by Israeli officials but emphasized that they resulted from the Oct. The State Department’s findings also concluded that the Israeli government “took several credible steps to identify officials who committed human rights abuses, with multiple trials pending at year’s end.” The report listed significant human rights abuses by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, including “arbitrary or unlawful killings; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary arrest or detention; serious restrictions on freedom of expression and trafficking in persons, including forced labor; and existence of the worst forms of child labor.” The report also included a detailed description of abuses by Hamas in Gaza, including, “unlawful killings, severe physical abuses and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.” Regarding human rights abuses by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza, the report said simply that “there have been reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom.” But it again added that “Israeli authorities took steps to identify and punish officials or civilians accused of committing human rights abuses.” And it did point out that human rights groups “frequently criticized authorities for not adequately pursuing investigations and disciplinary actions.” The report made no direct mention of the Israeli government’s restrictions on humanitarian aid into Gaza or documented reports of starvation among some Palestinians this year. But it did highlight that in the West Bank, incidents of Israeli violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average figure since the United Nations started recording data in 2005. The new report said that “Russia’s occupation and purported annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and four oblasts in eastern Ukraine affected significantly and negatively the human rights situation there.” It also described “credible reports of politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of Ukrainian citizens in Russia, many of whom claimed to have been tortured.” It also called the deportation of thousands of civilians to Russia, including children, a crime against humanity.

Article: Instead, two years after he graduated with a computer science bachelor’s degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, he’s unemployed and living with his parents in the suburbs of Chicago. I’m trying my best, but I guess my best isn’t good enough.” Barcenas has found himself in a job market with fewer places for young men, according to economists and recent labor market data. Amid a wider slowdown in hiring, the unemployment rate for men ages 23 to 30 with bachelor’s degrees has jumped in recent months to 6% — compared with 3.5% for young women with the same level of education, according to data analyzed by NBC News. The shift in employment prospects for men compared with women is tied partly to the changing dynamics of the labor market, in which much of the job growth has been driven by hiring in the health care and social services industry — in which nearly 80% of workers are female, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Essentially 100% of the labor force growth over recent months, maybe even a couple of years, has been coming from the health care industry, and that industry is overwhelmingly female,” said Emerson Sprick, director of retirement and labor policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that brings together Democratic and Republican policymakers. It’s very rocky, and I’m not sure if I will make it, if the foundation will be good enough in the future or if it’s going to topple over,” he said. The economy added just 73,000 jobs in July and fewer jobs than previously forecast in May and June, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Every guy I know that is without a job right now wants to work, but they just can’t get it,” said Eli McCullick, who has been looking for a job for more than a year after he graduated with a degree in sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder. “It’s demoralizing for guys who really want to get ahead and it’s just not happening.” McCullick, 23, said he hasn’t even been able to get an hourly job at a restaurant or doing cleaning work at a hotel in the Boulder area, where he’s living at a property his father owns. After more than a year of looking for work, McCullick decided to pivot to law school, which he hopes to start next year, and he was able to use his personal connections to get a paid internship at a law firm this fall. Trump increased his support among younger men in the 2024 election, winning the vote among men under 30 by 1 percentage point over Democrat Kamala Harris, according to exit polls. “I voted for him, but I’ll tell you what, it wasn’t because of immigration, it wasn’t because of foreign policy; it was because I bought the big lie about prosperity and economic growth,” McCullick said. So I feel disaffected, not only in the job market narrowly, but politically generally.” Results from an NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey, in April found 45% of young men approved of Trump’s job performance, while only 24% of young women did. "President Trump’s America First policies unleashed historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and this same policy mix — at an even bigger scale — is set to deliver again in President Trump’s second term," Desai said. The White House, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pointed to declines in unemployment since Trump took office for men of all ages without a college degree and for men ages 20 to 24 regardless of education. (NBC News' analysis looked at a different group: men ages 23 to 30 with a bachelor's degree and those with a high school degree.) For decades, men’s employment prospects have been deteriorating while women’s have been on the rise. Since the 1990s, a greater share of women than men have been earning bachelor’s degrees, with nearly half of women ages 25 to 34 holding bachelor’s degrees as of last year, compared with just over a third of men, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Young men are likelier to be financially dependent on their parents compared with young women, with 74% of women describing themselves as mostly financially independent, compared with 62% of young men, according to a separate Pew survey released last year. Most men who aren’t working or looking for work said in a survey that it was because of personal health issues — most likely the result of men’s having more physically demanding jobs — while women’s top reason was caring for children, according to Sprick, of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “It’s not a great time for young men to be not doing great in the labor market,” said Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, which researches and advocates for men’s well-being. “We’ve already had these long-term trends in higher education and earnings and geographical mobility that are already pretty troubling.” Sean Breen, who graduated this spring with a communications degree from California State University, Long Beach, said he and nearly all of his high school friends, both men and women, are back home living with their parents and unemployed. “We’re all, we are back in Marin County this summer, all unemployed, all trying to find a barista job, a part-time something, because we haven’t found anything.” After having applied to hundreds of jobs, he said, Breen now plans to go to graduate school in the fall at Trinity College in Ireland, where tuition is significantly lower and, he hopes, jobs will be more plentiful. “I don’t want a pity party, but it was so interesting to be in my position and look at all my other peers, as well, and be like, what happened?” Breen said. “It didn’t really matter what school or degree — it’s just the current job market.” The struggles vary by industry, and Reeves said he would like more programs to encourage men to go into health care and break down the gender stereotypes around certain career paths — similar to efforts to encourage women to go into construction.

Article: UK, France and Germany ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran if talks don't resume The foreign ministers of Germany, France and the UK have offered an extension for negotiations with Iran until the end of August Last month, Iran said it was prepared for further talks but only once sanctions already in place were lifted and its right to a civilian nuclear programme was agreed. The UK, France and Germany have told the UN they are ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if it fails to resume talks by the end of August. In a letter to the UN and its chief António Guterres, three foreign ministers - Jean-Noël Barrot from France, David Lammy from the UK and Johann Wadephul from Germany - said they would enforce severe sanctions on Iran unless it agrees to limit its nuclear programme. "We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, the E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism," the letter said. Sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme were previously lifted in 2015 after Iran signed a nuclear deal with the E3, the US, Russia and China, agreeing limits on its nuclear operations and to allow international inspectors entry to its nuclear sites. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 during President Donald Trump's first term, with the leader saying it did too little to stop Iran from creating a pathway to a nuclear bomb. In May, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it had more than 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - well above the level used for civilian purposes and close to weapons grade.

Article: Trump-Putin meet will be 'listening exercise,' White House says, as Kyiv 'mobilizes' allies In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin is pictured in Moscow on August 12, 2025. Leavitt told reporters that a face-to-face meeting will give Trump "the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed." "I think this is a listening exercise for the president," Leavitt said. And so this is for the president to go and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end." Though details of Friday's meeting are still being ironed out, Leavitt said it was "part of the plan" for Trump to meet one-on-one with Putin. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said of the call that "both sides confirmed their commitment to a successful event." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend the event. Our coordinated efforts and joint steps -- of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, all countries that want peace -- can definitely force Russia to make peace." After meeting with European leaders, Zelenskyy will have a virtual call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, two officials with knowledge of the arrangements told ABC News. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 49 drones and two North Korean-made ballistic missiles into the country overnight, of which 32 drones and both missiles were shot down or suppressed.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European leaders and top United States officials ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week. Both the German and Ukrainian governments confirmed the visit on Wednesday, which comes as Kyiv and its European allies push to ensure their voices are heard in discussions about ending the war. But he has unsettled European allies by suggesting Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory and by floating the idea of land swaps, without specifying what Moscow might surrender. Zelenskyy claimed he rejected an offer on Tuesday that Putin had proposed, where Ukraine would withdraw from the 30 percent of the Donetsk region it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal. Advertisement Kyiv and European officials fear that any US–Russia agreement reached without them could legitimise Moscow’s seizure of Ukrainian territory – including Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – four regions which are partly occupied by Russia. Fighting continues in eastern Ukraine Meanwhile, fighting continues along the front line, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reporting 165 clashes with Russian forces over the past day, with the heaviest fighting in the Pokrovsk, Novopavlivka and Lyman sectors. In the Kherson region, Russian forces used a drone to strike a civilian car on the Novoraisk–Kostyrka highway, killing a man and a woman, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin on Telegram. The AFP news agency has also reported that Ukraine is continuing to lose more ground, with evacuations in Bilozerske, while Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported that Russian forces had advanced in Nikanorivka, Shcherbynivka and near Petrivka in the Donetsk region. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff said its forces were engaged in “difficult” fighting near Pokrovsk in Donetsk, a key logistical hub for Kyiv’s forces, whose capture would deal a significant blow to its front-line defences and prospects at securing a favourable peace deal with Russia.

Article: European leaders are scrambling to convince United States President Donald Trump to use his upcoming summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to amplify pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Trump, who has promised to end the three-year war, plans to meet Putin in Alaska on Friday, saying the parties are close to a deal that could resolve the conflict. On Wednesday, August 13, major European leaders are first convening among themselves and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and are then scheduled to speak to Trump and US Vice President JD Vance. Here’s what Europe and Ukraine request of Trump, as he prepares for the meeting with Putin; Keep Ukraine in the room Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018. But he said he hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin, though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy. Let him not be on our side but in the middle.” On August 9, heads of state from France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Commission issued a statement in support of Ukraine. “We underline our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said, adding: “We continue to stand firmly alongside Ukraine.” The statement also insisted that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine”. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who is convening a video call on Wednesday involving Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy and several European leaders to discuss Ukraine, has since doubled down on that message. “We cannot accept that territorial issues between Russia and America are discussed or even decided over the heads of Europeans, over the heads of Ukrainians,” Merz said in a television interview on Sunday. The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on August 10 that “the US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”, but “any deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the whole of Europe’s security.” Ceasefire first Last week, Putin presented the Trump administration with a ceasefire proposal, demanding major territorial concessions from Kyiv in eastern Ukraine in exchange for an end to the fighting, according to European officials. Elsewhere, Zelenskyy said in a video message posted to his social media account on Monday night that “he [Putin] is definitely not preparing for a ceasefire or an end to the war”. Trump went on to say that “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval.’ I mean, he’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap – because there’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump said. He added that the land swap will be “for the good of Ukraine,” before adding that a possible deal will also involve “some bad stuff for both” Kyiv and Moscow. “We’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” he said.

Article: Cholera is ripping through the camps of Tawila in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands of people have been left with nothing but the water they can boil to serve as both disinfectant and medicine. “We mix lemon in the water when we have it and drink it as medicine,” said Mona Ibrahim, who has been living for two months in a hastily erected camp in Tawila. Nearly half a million people sought shelter in and around Tawila from the nearby besieged city of el-Fasher and the Zamzam displacement camp in April, following attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), at war with Sudan’s army since April 2023. The first cholera cases in Tawila were detected in early June in the village of Tabit, about 25km (16 miles) south, said Sylvain Penicaud, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF. In the past month, more than 1,500 cases have been treated in Tawila alone, he said, while the United Nations children’s agency says about 300 of the town’s children have contracted the disease since April. Ibrahim Adam Mohamed Abdallah, UNICEF’s executive director in Tawila, said his team “advises people to wash their hands with soap, clean the blankets and tarpaulins provided to them, and how to use clean water”. “It is extremely worrying,” said MSF’s Penicaud, but “those people have no (other) choice.” The UN has repeatedly warned of food shortages in Tawila, where aid has trickled in, but nowhere near enough to feed the hundreds of thousands who go hungry.

Article: Amanda Trebach, a Los Angeles resident who volunteers to document immigration enforcement operations on Terminal Island in San Pedro, found herself early Friday morning on the wrong side of an enforcement action. Advertisement Trebach is a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights organization, one of several advocacy groups that conduct local patrols to respond to and document immigration enforcement operations in Southern California. For the last several months, the registered nurse, alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, has volunteered her free time to help document masked federal immigration officials coming into and out of Terminal Island, which is being used as a staging area for immigration enforcement operations. The Department of Homeland Security blamed Trebach for inciting her own arrest, saying in a statement that she “jumped in front of moving vehicles, causing [Border Patrol agents] to swerve out of the way.” Advertisement Trebach allegedly “continued to hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents. However, Trebach was released from the federal detention center in Los Angeles on Saturday night without criminal charges, according to National Nurses United, a union and professional association of registered nurses. The Community Self Defense Coalition, an immigrant advocacy organization made up of about 80 subgroups across Los Angeles County, has been getting calls from concerned residents asking for resources for their neighbors and wanting guidance on how to create their own supportive network, including local patrols. “We must do so, however, in a way that keeps us safe, that doesn’t jeopardize our security and our constitutional rights because the times in which we’re living are just a bit too aggressive,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.

Article: Here, she demonstrates in front of the Hammer Museum in Westwood on July 30, 2025, where Lynda and Stewart Resnick — owners of Wonderful — have gifted millions of dollars. One of California’s largest agricultural employers plans to close a Central Valley grape nursery by the end of the year after laying off hundreds of employees, including many supportive of a United Farm Workers effort to unionize the workforce. Wonderful Co., owned by billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick, plans to shut down the majority of the nursery in Wasco, northwest of Bakersfield, and donate the farm to UC Davis, representatives for the company and the university confirmed this week. The move comes as Wonderful Nurseries remains locked in a battle with the UFW after the union last year petitioned to represent workers growing grapevines, using a new state “card check” law that made it easier for organizers to sign up workers. Advertisement “The decision to wind down Wonderful Nurseries was purely a business decision and in no way, shape or form related to our ongoing litigation with the UFW or the fraud so many farm workers reported by the union,” Wonderful Co. The table and wine grape industry is in a major downturn, meaning nurseries such as theirs have seen “significantly decreased sales and record losses, with no expectation of a turnaround anytime soon.” Yet some labor experts and Wonderful employees are questioning the timing of the layoffs, which started just five months after the UFW won a key legal victory in its effort to organize the workforce. Or is it really that they’re making a sound financial decision?” The UFW has not directly accused the Resnicks of retaliating against workers supportive of the union by closing the farm. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) At its seasonal peak, the 1,400-acre nursery employs about 600 workers who would have been part of the bargaining unit, but now only 20 still work at the facility, said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for the union. “We look forward to working with the Wonderful Company to successfully transfer the Wasco facilities and property to the University later this year.” The Resnicks are big donors to state politicians and charities, but their philanthropy has been the target of recent union organizing efforts. In late July, UFW and other labor organizers gathered outside the Hammer Museum, the recipient of more than $30 million in donations from the Resnicks, who have a building named after them. In the video, the worker, who has been a forefront anti-union advocate and has organized protests, is seen handing out $100 bills from the trunk of a car and encouraging workers to sign a sheet. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) Advertisement Now that Wonderful is closing its Wasco grape nursery, it is unclear what will happen in the proceedings, because there will soon be no workers to unionize. The UFW has rejected those accusations and, with the video, is suggesting that workers were paid to protest against the unionization effort at the height of the back-and-forth a year ago. Silva, a Wonderful Nurseries worker for the last six years, said tensions have long been running high at the nursery, with some co-workers saying they don’t have a right to ask for raises or benefits. Stop spending money fighting the United Farm Workers.” “This is my message to the Resnicks: if you can give millions to this art museum, which a majority of your workers will never visit, why can’t you also pay your workers something fair?” she said at the protest. “If you care so much about being respected by artists and lovers of art, why can’t you respect the people who plant, grow and harvest the products you sell?” Advertisement The UFW filed its petition with the labor board in February last year, asserting that a majority of the 600-plus farmworkers at Wonderful Nurseries in Wasco had signed the authorization cards and asking that the UFW be certified as their union representative. A ruling by a Kern County Superior Court judge that found the certification process under the card-check law as “likely unconstitutional” was superseded in October by an appellate court, which is still reviewing the case. Ana Padilla, executive director of the UC Merced Community and Labor Center, said the Central Valley has been blanketed with anti-union messaging ever since the passage of the card-check law.

Article: Perhaps that’s why a recent ranking by the betting website Action Network has some local astronomers scratching their heads over a decision to name California the best state in the nation to stargaze. Advertisement “The Action Network has analyzed sky visibility, elevation, historical meteor activity, and astronomical infrastructure to compile a ranked list of the best states for witnessing celestial events,” the website announced. “The ranking of those places doesn’t necessarily make any sense at all and is probably based on a variety of assumptions, maybe some judgment involved about which of those states have more dark sky territory and accessibility,” said Ed Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory. Advertisement Experts also took issue with the ranking’s focus on the states with the highest chances of spotting an asteroid, since you can’t actually see an asteroid with the naked eye from anywhere. (Tayfun Coskun / Anadolu via Getty Images) An asteroid is a small rocky object that can be so dim and faint you would need a telescope and know how to operate it to locate the object, said Bob Stephens, an amateur astronomer with the Riverside Astronomical Society. Despite doubts about the website’s methodology for picking the best stargazing state, California experts do agree there are plenty of areas within the state that allow people to enjoy a variety of cosmic events. Advertisement There are five internationally recognized Dark Sky Places in California, all in the southern part of the state, according to Dark Sky International, an organization that works to combat light pollution.

Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley National Park have been designated Dark Sky Parks, possessing “exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights and a nocturnal environment,” according to the organization. Julian and Borrego Springs are considered Dark Sky Communities, which were designated as such after showing “exceptional dedication to the preservation of the night sky through the implementation and enforcement of a quality outdoor lighting ordinance, dark sky education and citizen support.” Getting the best view depends on what you want to see. If you’re interested in seeing galaxies and clusters, it does benefit you to go to Dark Sky areas; you don’t absolutely have to, but they’ll be more spectacular in those designated areas. “There’s inexpensive robotic telescopes that can be operated from anywhere that can show you a lot, but I hesitate to tell people to start there because you spend $500 and then you lose the interest and it sits in a closet,” Stephens said. “Every month our local club goes down to the local shopping center under the parking lot lights to show people the moon, planets and some of the brighter clusters,” Stephens said.

Article: President Trump’s decision to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington has California officials on high alert, with some worrying that he intends to activate federal forces in the Bay Area and Southern California, especially during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The Washington deployment is another example of Trump seeking to use the military for domestic endeavors, similar to his decision to send the National Guard to Los Angeles in June, amid an immigration crackdown that sparked protests, experts said. Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said in a statement that the president’s characterization wasn’t rooted in fact, but “based in fear-mongering in an attempt to score cheap political points.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it “performative” and a “stunt.” Trump has said he would consider deploying the military to Los Angeles once again to protect the 2028 Olympic Games. Advertisement Los Angeles City Councilmember Imelda Padilla, who sits on the city panel overseeing the Games, acknowledged last week that the city is a “little nervous” about the federal government’s plans for securing the event. Padilla said her concern was based on the unpredictable nature of the administration, as well as recent immigration raids that have used masked, heavily armed agents to round up people at Home Depot parking lots and car washes. Bass, appearing on CNN this week, said that using the National Guard during the Olympics is “completely appropriate.” She said that the city expects a “federal response when we have over 200 countries here, meaning heads of state of over 200 countries. “To say, well, we can take over your city whenever we want, and I’m the commander in chief, and I can use the troops whenever we want.” On Monday, Trump tied his action to what has been a familiar theme to him: perceived urban decay. We’re not going to lose our cities over this.” Advertisement White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said officers and agents deployed across the District of Columbia have so far made 23 arrests for offenses including homicide, possession with intent to distribute narcotics, lewd acts, reckless driving, fare evasion and not having permits. They would be aghast that there are soldiers patrolling their streets.” The District of Columbia does not have control over its National Guard, which gives the president wide latitude to deploy those troops. “We have such a strong tradition that we don’t use the military for domestic law enforcement, and it’s a characteristic of authoritarian countries to see the military be used in that way,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley Law School and a constitutional law expert. “That’s never been so in the United States, and many are concerned about the way in which President Trump is acting the way authoritarian rulers do.” Advertisement Whether the troops deployed to Los Angeles in June amid the federal immigration raids were used for domestic law enforcement in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is central in the trial underway this week in federal court in San Francisco. There are circumstances where the federal government has put departments under consent decrees — a reform tool for agencies that have engaged in unlawful practices — but in those cases the government alleged specific civil rights violations, said Ed Obayashi, a Northern California sheriff’s deputy and legal counsel on policing.

School police and officers from several municipal forces will patrol near some 100 schools, setting up “safe zones” in heavily Latino neighborhoods, with a special concentration at high schools where older Latino students are walking to campus. “Here you have an entire array of elected officials, appointed officials, education leaders, people committed to our children, and we are gathered here today to talk about protecting our children from the federal government,” Bass said. Instead agents were conducting “a targeted operation” on a “criminal illegal alien,” they described as “a Salvadoran national and suspected MS-13 pledge with prior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity of Arleta.” Advertisement At a Tuesday White House briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, responded to a question that referenced the L.A.

(Juliana Yamada / Los Angeles Times) School communities in fear The incident outside Arleta High is among the ongoing confrontations across the region that have provoked public protests and prompted the Trump administration in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles. Trump administration policy is that no location — including a school — is off limits for enforcement actions in his drive to deport at least 1 million immigrants a year. “A big part of it is to create the sense of fear so people will self-deport,” said Jimmy Gomez, a Trump critic and Democratic member of Congress representing Los Angeles. Advertisement “We’re about to welcome students back to schools, but we’re very concerned that these fears and anxieties may potentially have an impact for students not wanting to come back,” said Lynwood Unified school board member Alma Castro, an organizer of the event. She called her district a “safe haven.” Among other measures, her district has trained staff to “restrict the sharing of any student files, any student information, and there’s been some work with thinking about our facilities to ensure that we have campuses that are closed off, that people can’t just walk in.” L.A. “But we are deploying resources at a level never before seen in our district.” Other various efforts include: Starting a task force to coordinate safe passage zones with local cities Setting up a donor-supported compassion fund to help families with legal and other costs Coordinating food aid for families in hiding Providing legal referrals Contacting more than 10,000 families to encourage them to send children to schools Providing information about online schooling options Distributing a “family preparedness” guide Carvalho and leaders of other school districts reiterated that K-12 campuses and anything related to schooling, such as a school bus or a graduation ceremony, will be off limits to immigration agents unless they have a valid judicial warrant for a specific individual — which has been rare. We hope that through our communication efforts, our awareness efforts, information and the direct counseling with students and parents, that we’ll be able to provide stable attendance for kids in our community.” Reason to be afraid Mary, a Los Angeles mother of three without legal status, was terrified, but more or less knew what to do when immigration agents came to her door twice in May for a “wellness check” on her children: She did not let them in to her home.

Article: Advertisement That website paints a grim picture of the city’s finances and proposes a solution: allowing “a limited number of people to rent their second homes to travelers.” Supporters say the plan could generate about $80 million in tax revenue annually, especially as tourists descend on Los Angeles for the 2026 World Cup, 2027 Super Bowl, and 2028 Olympics. Advertisement Fliers for the campaign, which urges the City Council to amend the short-term rental ordinance to include second homes, list as supporters a broad coalition of groups, from unions like Teamsters Local 911 to the business-aligned Central City Assn. Nick Gerber, an organizer for the hotel and restaurant workers union Unite Here Local 11, which opposes the campaign, said that when a canvasser knocked on his door, he asked who the campaign’s supporters were. “I looked at the back of the shirt with all the [organizations] listed and did not see any of these short-term rental companies, but right away, I thought this was clearly something they were behind,” Gerber said. “It doesn’t say Airbnb on it, but this is something that Airbnb has been pushing for years, and they’re using what I think is pretty deceptive tactics to try to get sympathy from the public,” Soto-Martínez said. approves new rules for Airbnb-type rentals after years of debate The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to impose new rules on renting out rooms and homes for short stays, regulating a phenomenon popularized by the rise of online platforms such as Airbnb. Airbnb confirmed that it is involved in Save Our Services but declined to say whether it has contributed any money to the campaign and did not respond to questions about its exact role. “It’s pretty simple: new tax revenue from tourists can give Los Angeles much-needed funding for city services and union jobs that are at risk,” said Justin Wesson, senior public policy manager for Airbnb. Wesson said that Airbnb has organized a “diverse coalition” for the campaign and will continue to “support practical short-term rental policies that balance the benefits of tourism with community needs.” The campaign does not appear to be registered with the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, according to the commission’s website, and Airbnb did not immediately respond to a question about whether the campaign has registered. Anyone who spends $5,000 or more to attempt to influence municipal legislation, and who is not a lobbyist, is required to register with the commission as a “major filer” and report their spending. The campaign website notes that the additional tax revenue would come in two streams: an estimated $38 million from the sales tax generated by tourists spending money at local businesses and another $41 million from the transient occupancy tax of 14% on short-term rentals. Critics of Save Our Services said that Airbnb hosts often evade the transient occupancy tax and that the city should step up its enforcement of the tax instead of opening up more homes for short-term rentals. Randy Renick, executive director of Better Neighbors LA, which focuses on regulating short-term rentals, said evading the tax is “the fundamental issue,” with some Airbnb hosts claiming their residences are outside city limits. Maria Hernandez, a spokesperson for Unite Here, which is part of the Better Neighbors LA coalition, said an increase in short-term rentals would exacerbate the city’s housing shortage by removing units from the long-term market. “The way for the city to address its budget crisis is to enforce existing laws, fining the landlords who illegally convert housing to hotels, and making sure the platforms actually pay the taxes they avoid.” The campaign has created some strange bedfellows. City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who often spars with Soto-Martínez, also opposes the campaign, saying she doesn’t want to create an incentive for people to buy up properties and turn them into short-term rentals. “Labor, community, housing, business, and civic organizations have come together to find immediate and practical solutions that would help generate nearly $80 million in new annual revenue to save jobs and services, protect Angelenos’ livelihoods, and stabilize the city’s finances,” said Eric Tate, executive secretary treasurer for Teamsters Joint Council 42, in a statement.

Article: The budget reconciliation bill President Donald Trump dramatically signed into law last month will painfully extract $1,200 a year from the poorest people and sprinkle the richest with an extra $13,600 a year they may not even feel. Of course, we knew even before Monday’s report from the Congressional Budget Office reminded us that Trump’s bill — with its cuts to the social safety net and cuts to top earners’ taxes — would redistribute wealth from the poorest to the richest. The CBO, which does nonpartisan analysis for Congress, released the above numbers Monday in response to a request from four Democratic lawmakers: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York; Rep. The CBO’s letter is a response to the Democrats’ “request for an analysis of the distributional effects” of the bill that Republicans are touting as not just good but “beautiful.” The report found that the average U.S. household “will see an increase in the resources available to them over the 2026–2034 period” but that “the changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households” and that “in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution.” Specifically, the CBO report finds, “Resources for households in the lowest decile (tenth) of the income distribution will decrease by about $1,200 per year (in 2025 dollars),” which “amounts to 3.1% of their income.” The report adds, “Those projected decreases are mainly attributable to reductions in in-kind transfers, such as Medicaid and SNAP.” The bill means much less money for food and health care for the poor and a little more money in the bank for the rich. The extra 2.7% in income those in the top tenth of income distribution are projected to get “are mainly attributable to reductions in the taxes households in that decile owe.” If the CBO’s language is too staid or technical for you, then here’s another way to make the point: The bill means much less money for food and health care for the poor and a little more money in the bank for the rich. Despite Trump’s vows that he wouldn’t cut Medicaid, and despite some Republican lawmakers’ vows that they wouldn’t support a bill that cut Medicaid, it was always clear that Republicans — even with all their budgetary sleight of hand — couldn’t give what they wanted to give to the rich without taking away money used to provide health coverage for poor people. But not only did Trump and his party cut Medicaid; the bill is projected to have the effect of cutting 2.4 million people off SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program. Rather than confess to lying about the impact the bill would have, the Republicans said they weren’t hurting the country’s most vulnerable people, just going after fraud, waste and abuse. Jason Smith, of Missouri, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, claimed on social media that “CBO has a troubled track record of getting its estimates incorrect and, like Democrats, is biased in favor of more federal spending and higher taxes.” “Don’t buy it,” Smith added. Reading the CBO report, I couldn’t help but think of the Bible story in which the prophet tells the king a parable about a wealthy landowner with plenty of cattle and sheep who needs to feed a guest — and does so by stealing the only sheep his neighbor owns.

Of course, if Congress had allowed the District of Columbia to spend its own money, it could put more cops on the beat, which would enable more stops and arrests. Despite pleas from Mayor Muriel Bowser and Graves, it has refused to tweak existing laws like the Second Look Act and Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act (IRAA), which allowed some convicted felons to return to the streets and re-offend.

Article: Zelenskyy to visit Berlin for meetings ahead of Trump-Putin summit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will join German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Wednesday for talks with European and U.S. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings for Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine's leaders heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow's war in Ukraine. A call between leaders of countries involved in the "coalition of the willing" - those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv - will take place last. When Zelenskyy last visited Berlin in late May, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations and consultations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith to end the war. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was "currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war," and urged Ukraine's partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and "force Russia to peace." "Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as "a feel-out meeting" where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with "Putin and Zelenskyy and me." The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia's energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine's NATO membership off the table - something that Putin has demanded - and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Trump has also routinely threatened and cajoled his NATO allies over defense spending, and has shown little mercy in trade talks by hiking tariffs on most EU imports to 15%, ostensibly for U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss "certain aspects" of preparations for the Friday meeting in which "both parties confirmed their striving for a successful summit," according to the foreign ministry.

It is "far greater" than what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates and "sets a new benchmark", Ajay Srivastava of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank, told the BBC. Under the agreement, UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated almost on par with Indian suppliers and also have real-time access to information on forthcoming public tenders and procurement opportunities. Also, goods from the UK made with just 20% domestic input can now be supplied to the Indian government, allowing UK companies the flexibility to source up to 80% of the parts or raw material from other countries and still qualify for procurement preference in India. The minimum contract value at which these firms can bid for government projects has also been sharply reduced as a result of which "UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects - such as rural roads, solar equipment for schools, or IT systems for government offices - that were previously out of reach", said Mr Srivastava. Getty Images UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects such as rural roads But for British companies, realising this opportunity on the ground will be easier said than done, several experts told the BBC. While UK suppliers are eligible to participate as Class-II local suppliers, Indian companies will continue to get preferential treatment as Class-I suppliers, says Dr Arpita Mukherjee, a trade expert with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. Moreover, pricing plays a key role in winning contracts, and "UK companies tend to have higher prices" compared with Indian companies, which will be a major challenge for them, she adds. A more significant deterrent will be delayed payments and difficult contract enforcement, which are "major legacy issues when it comes to public procurement in India", says Srijan Shukla of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank. He says a study on procurement by India's central public sector enterprises from 2017 to 2020 found that pending payments to suppliers were often more than the total average procurement in a year. "This will impact UK players trying to enter India's public procurement markets, especially when it comes to public contracts that have long-time horizons and are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties," Mr Shukla told the BBC. Pending dues have been a major irritant for India's small businesses too, leading to short-term liquidity issues that often "force them out of these procurement markets and reallocate that business to the big players", according to Mr Shukla. Much of this is reflected in India's poor ranking - 163 out of 190 - on contract enforcement in the World Bank's Doing Business report, the latest round of which was in 2020. While things have improved since these rankings were published - with one-stop-shop portals like Government e-Marketplace, the Central Public Procurement Portal or the recently launched online dispute resolution portal bringing more transparency to the public tendering process - payment discipline by government entities continues to remain a challenge, says Mr Shukla. She adds the deal excludes the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement's dispute settlement provisions for four years after the CETA takes effect - these provisions usually define how disputes are resolved. Over time, companies from the UK will have to learn the way to work around complexities regarding the art of winning public tenders and navigating though complex regulations," Mr Shukla says.

He said work was being done on the site that would be "bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment." "It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!" he wrote.

In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and actor Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump's proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term.

Article: U.N.-backed investigators say they have found significant evidence of “systematic torture” at Myanmar detention centers, where the military government is holding children as young as 2 years old as proxies for their parents. Roslan Rahman / AFP via Getty Images file Investigators said Tuesday there was evidence of “a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities” across Myanmar, with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government security forces and affiliated militias as well as armed opposition groups. That includes an increase in crimes committed against those in detention, many of whom are being held without due process, said Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. “We’ve documented torture against those in detention, including beatings and electric shocks, strangulations, pulling out fingernails, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,” he told reporters in Geneva as his team released its annual report. Koumjian said investigators had seen evidence that children as young as 2 years old were being detained, often in place of their parents if they are accused of being associated with the opposition and cannot be found. Myanmar’s military government has detained about 30,000 people in the past four years, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests in the country. The 16-page report, which covers a one-year period up to June 30, draws on more than 1,300 sources, including nearly 600 eyewitness testimonies, photographs, videos, documents, maps and forensic evidence.

Along with other ethnic groups, the remaining Rohingya population is again in danger as they are persecuted by the Arakan Army rebel group that now has effective control of Rakhine state, their ancestral home.

In a week of frantic diplomacy, the virtual summit will include Trump alongside the leaders of Ukraine, Germany, France, Britain, Finland, Italy, Poland and the European Union and NATO, said the German government, which has organized the call. The digitally linked gaggle of leaders “will address, among other things, further options for exerting pressure on Russia,” the German government spokesperson said, adding that “peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security” would be on the agenda. Most European leaders fear that Russia will not stop at the 20% of Ukraine it currently occupies following its 2022 full-scale invasion, and instead may use this landgrab from which to launch further attacks on Moscow’s former Soviet vassals.

Article: Miami’s Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for Cubans fleeing communist rule at the height of the Cold War MIAMI -- For decades, its powerful lighthouse illuminated Miami’s Biscayne Bay, and during the height of the Cold War, what was known as the Freedom Tower stood as a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing communist rule. What we’re doing here is reminding people what immigrants can accomplish when they’re given the opportunity.” The iconic building opened in 1925 as the headquarters of the once-acclaimed Miami Daily News, which shuttered decades ago. It was designed, in the style of a Moorish bell tower from Seville, Spain, by the New York architectural firm Schultze & Weaver, which was behind some of the most glamorous hotels, theaters and office towers of the era. Known to the Spanish-speaking migrants as “El Refugio,” or “The Refuge,” it was a safe place to get vaccines, fill out paperwork, and receive financial assistance of around $120 per month. In the Grand Hall, with its giant windows and Corinthian columns, the Pizarra de la Suerte — the Bulletin Board of Good Luck — carried job notices to help the Cubans adjust to their new life, according to a replica of the hall in the museum. But over time, the exiles would trudge back from the cold and snow to put their unmistakable Cuban stamp on what over the ensuing decades would become one of America’s most vibrant cultural and economic hubs. But he still wells up recalling the hardship of his departure — when Cuban customs officials ripped open his teddy bear looking for contraband jewelry — and arriving in Miami on a “Freedom Flight” paid for by the U.S. “To this day, a grilled cheese sandwich with cheap, Velveeta processed cheese is still comfort food to me.” The Freedom Tower, a national historic landmark, was long ago overtaken by Miami’s fast-growing steel and glass skyline. They include exhibits dedicated to Victims of Communism, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that the CIA organized against Castro, and the 14,000 unaccompanied minors sent by their parents as part of the U.S.-led Operation Peter Pan. There’s also a makeshift recording studio for those who passed through the Freedom Tower to add their testimony to an archive of over 300 oral history interviews with exiles, including prominent voices like singer Gloria Estefan. Emerging from the dark galleries of often traumatic stories of dislocation and exile, the museum’s final stop is a gallery flooded with all the sun, salsa and pastel hues that make modern-day Miami so beloved.

(Philippine Coast Guard via AP) MANILA, Philippines -- The United States deployed two warships on Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal, where two Chinese navy and coast guard ships collided two days ago while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident captured on video, alarming several Western and Asian countries. The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. Navy has staged what it calls freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea for years to challenge China’s restrictions and demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years. On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern “by the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard,” saying in a statement the incident "highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” “This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coast guard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the (anti-)collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.” Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500 feet (152 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coast guard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board.

Siddiq, who is Hasina's niece, resigned from her post as an anti-corruption minister in Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s government in January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt and was named in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh. Separately, the anti-corruption investigation has also alleged that Siddiq’s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled. Siddiq represents the north London district of Hampstead and Highgate in Parliament, served in Britain’s center-left Labor Party government as economic secretary to the Treasury — the minister responsible for tackling financial corruption.

Article: Breaking with the reality TV show that helped make Trump a household name, the Republican president is not telling his top appointees “You're fired!” but instead offering them another way to stay in his administration. Still, those leaving often are the subject of effusive praise and kept in Trump's political orbit, potentially preventing them from becoming critics who can criticize him on TV — something that didn't happen to a long list of former first-term officials. “It is a tremendous honor to represent the United States as an ambassador — which is why these positions are highly coveted and reserved for the president’s most loyal supporters," said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. "Mike Waltz, Billy Long and Tammy Bruce are great patriots who believe strongly in the America First agenda, and the President trusts them fully to advance his foreign policy goals.” Waltz's days appeared numbered after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg revealed in March that Waltz had added him to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. “From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first,” Trump posted in announcing Waltz’s move on May 1. But Bruce had also begun to frequently decline to respond to queries on the effectiveness, substantiveness or consistency of the administration’s approaches to the Middle East, Russia’s war in Ukraine and other global hotspots. She told reporters that special envoy Steve Witkoff “is heading to the region now — to the Gaza area” but then had to concede that she’d not been told exactly where in the Middle East he was going. During her final State Department briefing on Tuesday, Bruce said Trump's announcing that he wanted her in a new role “was a surprise,” but called the decision “especially moving as it allows me to continue serving the State Department, to which I'm now quite attached.” Then there’s Long, a former Republican Missouri congressman, who was the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862. After learning that Trump wanted him in Reykjavik, Long posted, “Exciting times ahead!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say Tuesday why Long was removed as IRS chief and being deployed to Iceland. Former television commentator Morgan Ortagus, who was a State Department spokesperson during Trump's first term, is now a special adviser to the United Nations after serving as deputy envoy to the Middle East under Witkoff. He posted in January, while announcing her as Witkoff's deputy, that “Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson." “These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them," Trump added.

Article: The mobilization officially marks the beginning of their deployment, and all 800 soldiers ordered by Trump to the city should be operational by the end of the week, a senior Army official said. Mayor Muriel Bowser struck a critical tone about Trump in remarks to community leaders last night, characterizing his actions as an “authoritarian push.” But on the whole, her response to the mobilization has been far more measured than those of Democrats, both in the D.C. She also struck a neutral tone after a meeting yesterday with Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she was focused on “how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have.” Bowser’s reaction to Trump might have something to do with the law, federal money and a long-standing threat to repeal self-government in the city being lined up behind him, giving the mayor little choice but to comply. And she’s at a disadvantage as her administration fights to get Congress and Trump to reverse course on a law enacted this year that froze $1 billion in city money. takeover: Black civil rights leaders and mayors of several cities said Trump’s move is “fundamentally grandstanding.” And by suggesting that other cities run by Black mayors may be next, Trump was “playing the worst game of racially divisive politics,” one mayor said. The ongoing standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Texas, as the GOP moves to redraw district maps mid-decade (rather after the new census in 2030) and Democrats seek to stop them, has put the issue in the burning hot center of Democratic politics. JB Pritzker — whose state is hosting many Democratic lawmakers who left the Texas to deny a quorum in the state House — is taking on the role of protector-in-chief and has vowed to stand in the way of Trump and Texas officials who authorized civil arrest warrants. Any Democrats hoping to draw attention on the national stage must show the base they know how to take off the gloves, says one leader at a progressive grassroots group. The White House is reviewing the Smithsonian’s museum exhibitions, materials and operations — and plans to commemorate the country’s 250th anniversary — to ensure it aligns with Trump’s views of history.

AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year - among other challenges and "uncertainties in its business operations" that the Florida company expects to continue "for at least the remainder of 2025." Spirit's shares tumbled more than 40% Tuesday, with the company's stock closing at $2.10. And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines - many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings - Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process, and Spirit has not publicly indicated interest in such a transaction since.

Trump held up a chart that first appeared on Fox News and was shared by Vice President JD Vance last week purportedly comparing Washington’s homicide rate to that of eight other “capitals.” (One, Lagos, Nigeria, is not a capital.) But the chart cites outdated data and omits several capitals and many other cities with much higher rates. Trump has a point that Washington’s homicide rate is much higher than many capitals, but its rate is nowhere near the highest “anywhere in the world.” In 2023, according to data compiled by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, capitals with higher homicide rates included Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with a rate of 67.2 per 100,000 people; Cape Town, South Africa, with 66.8; Kingston, Jamaica, with 64.2; Caracas, Venezuela, with 47.9; and Guatemala City at 47.8. Overall, the think tank reported, 47 cities with more than 250,000 people had higher homicide rates than 40.4 and 49 cities had rates higher than 39.1, including six in the United States: Memphis, New Orleans, St. According to data compiled by the city’s Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the police made about 1,500 arrests of children in 2020; 1,400 in 2021; 1,700 in 2022; 2,200 in 2023; and 2,000 in 2024. What Was Said “They know, these young gangs — or as they’re called here, crews — they know that if they’re 14, 15, 16, or 17, they’re below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree. And understand I’m not just a federal prosecutor, I’m the local D.A., so to speak here for D.C.: All of the cases go to family court and the goal of family court — the 14- through 17-year-olds — and those cases go to family court where the focus is rehabilitation and they talk about ice cream socials and yoga.” — Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. But youths arrested on other offenses can be prosecuted by the city’s elected attorney general, who prosecuted 84 percent of violent crimes committed by children in 2024, and about 73 percent of all crimes. A recent investigation by The Washington Post also found that the number of dangerous incidents at the center nearly quadrupled in recent years, and that many children are held longer than the stated goal of 30 days.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File) WASHINGTON -- Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border. It’s the second time in months that Mexico has expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow of drugs onto American streets. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores — under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. courts, and the citizens of both of our nations will be safer from these common enemies.” The February transfers came as Mexican officials were trying to head off the Trump administration’s threat of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports. Also included in the group expelled Tuesday was Servando Gómez Martinez, also known as “La Tuta,” a former school teacher who became one of Mexico’s most-wanted drug lords as head of the Knights Templar cartel. Alongside his two brothers, Abigael González Valencia led “Los Cuinis,” which financed the the founding and growth of the CJNG, one of the most powerful and dangerous cartels in Mexico.

Article: Speaking at a news conference in Ankara with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani, Fidan accused Israel and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, of undermining the country’s efforts to reestablish itself after more than a decade of civil war. He said Israel had “fueled certain difficulties” in Syria and warned that Israeli security "cannot be achieved through undermining the security of your neighbors." “To the contrary, you should make sure your neighboring countries are prosperous and secure. If you try to destabilize these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.” Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new interim government in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war. Most recently, hundreds were killed in clashes in the southern province of Sweida between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side and fighters from the country’s Druze minority on the other. Implementation of an agreement reached in March to merge the SDF with the new Syrian army has stalled and there have been scattered outbreaks of violence between the two sides. Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an “opportunity for themselves.” Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, affiliated with the Kurdish group that recently entered a peace process with Turkey after more than 40 years of fighting. “The upper echelons of the YPG need to stop stalling because the chaos they’re waiting for (in Syria) will not take place, and even if it does, it will not be to their advantage,” Fidan said. We have good intentions, but that doesn’t mean we will turn a blind eye to your mischievous or devious ways.” Turkey has been supportive of Syria’s new administration, which is formed largely by rebels that Ankara backed during the civil war. “There are certain people who have been meddling in the affairs of Syria, chief among whom is the Israeli administration.” Al-Shibani, meanwhile, said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts.”

Article: A Swiss ocean protection group is handing out bars of soap to negotiators working on a global accord to end plastic pollution Hanna Eberhard, with the World Wildlife Fund, arranges plastic waste on a conveyor belt display in front of the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, Aug. (AP Photo/ Jennifer McDermott) Hanna Eberhard, with the World Wildlife Fund, arranges plastic waste on a conveyor belt display in front of the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland, Wednesday, Aug. The messaging on the cardboard box from the Geneva-based Gallifrey foundation reads "no dirty tricks, vote for a clean plastics treaty.” As Thai diplomat Jutha Saovabha walked to the treaty talks Wednesday morning, Gallifrey Foundation spokesperson Laurianne Trimoulla stopped him to chat and handed him a soap. The meeting at the United Nations office in Geneva is supposed to be the last and people are getting creative to put the pressure on to get a deal done. The International Pollutants Elimination Network gave wristbands to UN officials, delegates and plastic waste workers before the talks to measure their exposure to chemicals used to make plastics and show the importance of protecting human health with the treaty. “What I was surprised by, is that all over the world, because this study has been carried throughout different regions, we are all being exposed to those added chemicals in plastics. There was a large red button that said “EMERGENCY”, plus a sign that read “PUSH THE BUTTON, STOP THE PLASTIC FLOOD NOW.” The WWF urged delegates to the talks to push the red button and halt the belt, to represent stopping plastic pollution. “We need to make sure all eyes are on Geneva in this critical moment where we have this once in a generation opportunity to create a safe and healthy world for everyone," said Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation in Geneva. Much like in Washington, D.C., industry leaders and company executives are meeting with delegates to answer questions and convey their priorities for the treaty, said Chris Jahn, president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council. “We’re happy to provide information when it’s useful and we’ll be here as long as we need to, to hopefully get a deal.” Benjamin Von Wong, a Canadian artist and activist, is heaping piles of plastic waste onto a large sculpture in front of the U.N.

Article: After years of being told that red wine was good for heart health, more Americans appear to be heeding warnings that even moderate alcohol consumption can be unhealthy WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a new Gallup poll released Wednesday. The federal government’s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer. social research, Lydia Saad, said shifting health advice throughout older Americans’ lives may be a reason why they have been more gradual than young adults to recognize alcohol as harmful. in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.” The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question’s history. About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.

Article: Even though the conflict did not involve Nakhchivan, it cut off the Zangezur Corridor, a 40km (25-mile) logistical umbilical cord to Azeri mainland that consists of a derelict road and parallel rusty rail tracks. Air travel and hours-long, bumpy transit through Iran remained the only way to reach the exclave, whose authorities ruled it like a personal fiefdom, with laws and ways of life often contradicting those of the mainland. After winning the 2020 war over Nagorno-Karabakh and restoring control over it three years later, Baku has been eager to revive the corridor, demanding its exterritoriality and even pondering the use of military force. It may increase the flow of Central Asian hydrocarbons to Turkiye and further to Europe, boost the regional economy – and upend Russia’s two centuries of domination in the region that also includes Georgia. But Trump cut through the Gordian knot on Friday, and his role “essentially, cements a new reality in the region”, according to Emil Mustafayev, the Baku-based chief editor of the Minval Politika online magazine. They also flattered Trump by naming the corridor the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP) and leasing it to Washington for up to 99 years with exclusive development rights. China, which has been promoting its Belt and Road Initiative in Asia and Eastern Europe, may remain “neutral” to it, and Russia, which has two military bases in Armenia, may “ignore it, at least, publicly”, he said. “But for Iran, it’s a real blow.” ‘A boost of Washington’s clout’ To guard the TRIPP, Washington may use a private military company – and eventually build a military base that nominally safeguards Armenia but actually keeps an eye on Iran, said Ukrainian political analyst Aleksey Kushch. “It means more potential pressure on Iran and a boost of Washington’s clout in the resource-rich Caspian region where US oil companies made sizeable investments” in the 1990s, he said. “No matter how paradoxical it sounds, it’s Moscow that has been and still is a decisive factor in the peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan and in solving the latter’s problem of accessing Nakhchivan,” said Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London. Advertisement “One of the main motives for rapprochement of both sides is their push to get rid of Moscow’s influence, of the peacekeeper’s role it has imposed on them,” he told Al Jazeera. A deal not yet done Baku, whose annual $5bn defence spending exceeds Yerevan’s entire debt-hobbled state budget, affirmed Armenia’s territorial integrity but did not withdraw from some 200sq km (77sq miles) of its land.

Article: Ahead of the summit, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war." BERLIN, Germany — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is joining German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Wednesday for talks with European and U.S. Merz has convened a series of virtual meetings for Wednesday in an attempt to have the voice of European and Ukraine’s leaders heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow's war in Ukraine. A call between leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — will take place last. When Zelenskyy last visited Berlin in late May, Merz pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,” and urged Ukraine's partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and "force Russia to peace.” "Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday's summit as "a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader's intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday's summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region which is part of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine's ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts. Ukrainian drones struck the Unecha station which supplies the Russian army, the statement said, adding that damage and a large fire was reported in the area around the pumping station.

Article: Gaza talks to focus on releasing hostages all in one go, Netanyahu hints 10 minutes ago Share Save Yolande Knell Middle East correspondent Share Save ABIR SULTAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Netanyahu has dismissed international criticism of his plans to expand the war Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that Gaza ceasefire efforts are now focused on a comprehensive deal to release all the remaining hostages at once. After indirect talks between Israel and Hamas broke down last month, Israel announced a controversial plan to widen its military offensive and conquer all the Gaza Strip - including the areas where most of its two million Palestinian residents have sought refuge. "The release of all the hostages, both alive and dead - that's the stage we're at." Palestinian armed groups still hold 50 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that triggered the war. Last week, unnamed Arab officials were quoted as saying that regional mediators, Egypt and Qatar, were preparing a new framework for a deal that would involve releasing all remaining hostages at the same time in return for an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. This is likely to be why, at a news conference on Tuesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told journalists that Cairo was still "making great efforts" with Qatar and the US - the other mediators - to revive the earlier phased plan. "The main goal is to return to the original proposal - a 60-day ceasefire - along with the release of some hostages and some Palestinian prisoners, and the flow of humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza without obstacles or conditions," Abdelatty said.

Eyal Zamir, the military’s chief of staff, pushed back last week against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposal to control Gaza City, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. General Zamir was concerned about the exhaustion and fitness of reservists, about risking the lives of Israeli hostages and about potentially tasking troops with governing millions of Palestinians, the officials said. Since then, tensions have intensified between General Zamir and the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, over the promotion of senior military officers, leading to a standoff between the two security leaders.

Temperatures will rise into the high 20Cs and low 30Cs, with parts of the East Midlands, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire experiencing the hottest weather with a maximum temperature of 33C forecast on Wednesday afternoon. There are further heavy and thundery showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland on Thursday, with an additional yellow weather warning in place from midnight on Wednesday until 22:00 on Thursday. While Scotland and Northern Ireland will not technically be in a heatwave, due to the three consecutive day rule, temperatures there are still well above the average for the time of year with a forecast of 25C to 29C on Wednesday. An amber heat health alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Met Office, means the weather's impacts are likely to be felt across the health service. Extreme weather events in Europe should be treated as "a health emergency, not just a climate one", a World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group that looks into the health impacts of climate change said on Wednesday.

Article: The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when his term expires in May, including three that have not previously been publicly named, according to two administration officials who declined to be named. They now join a list of 8 other candidates that CNBC has confirmed are under consideration, including Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, Fed Governor Chris Waller, and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. The officials described a "deliberative process" where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will interview all of the candidates, winnow down the list and pass on a final list to the president for his decision. The longer the process takes, the less likely there is to be a so-called "shadow fed chair" in place for several months before Powell leaves, which some have suggested would be disruptive for monetary policy. Though sharply critical — on an almost daily basis — of Powell, President Trump has backed off suggestions he might replace the Fed Chair before the end of his term in May.

Article: Marking 100 days until the home Ashes series against England begins in Perth, Cricket Australia CEO Greenberg suggested that quality, not quantity, was important in keeping the red-ball game viable. “That’s why the Ashes will be as enormous and as profitable as it is – because it means something.” England have just completed a thrilling 2-2 home drawn series against India in front of sold-out crowds. At the same time, New Zealand and Australia romped to easy overseas Test series wins against uncompetitive West Indies and Zimbabwe teams respectively, leaving question marks over the quality of Test cricket in those countries. One idea is to create two or more divisions of Test cricket to keep it competitive, but Greenberg said he did not have a strong opinion on the ideal number of Test-playing nations. “The interest is quite extraordinary with ticket allocations for 11 of the 20 days on sale already exhausted.” Advertisement Australia were defeated by South Africa in the final of the 2025 World Test Championship at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London in June.

Lloyd Braun, whose résumé includes stints running ABC Entertainment, the Yahoo Media Group and the WME talent agency, lifted the curtain Wednesday on what he and his partners are calling MicroCo. It’s the first Hollywood effort to capitalize on micro dramas, an addictive, bite-size entertainment genre that started in China a few years ago and has ballooned into a more than $7 billion business there, according to analysts. Shows available on ReelShort, a Chinese-backed app, have titles like “Selling My Virginity to the Mafia King” and “Pregnant by My Ex’s Professor Dad.” Production costs are minuscule by Hollywood standards, with Chinese companies spending as little as $15,000 for an entire season, analysts say.

(AP Photo/Ronald Zak, File) BERLIN -- The top diplomats of Britain, France, and Germany threatened to reimpose sanctions on Iran as an end-of-the-month deadline nears for the country to resume negotiations with the West over its nuclear program and cooperation with the United Nations nuclear watchdog. The three countries, known as the E3, wrote in a letter to the United Nations dated Friday that they were willing to trigger a process known as the “snapback” mechanism, which allows one of the Western parties to reimpose U.N. “We have made clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism.” The letter comes following a period of apparent diplomatic deadlock after a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, where Israeli and American jets struck some key nuclear-related facilities in the Islamic Republic. The countries met with Iranian officials last month in Turkey at Iran’s consulate building in Istanbul on the possibility of reimposing international sanctions, lifted in 2015 in exchange for Tehran accepting restrictions and monitoring of its nuclear program. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, said at the time that he hoped that the meeting would see the E3 nations reassess their “previous unconstructive attitude.” Since the war, talks with Washington for a new nuclear deal have not resumed, and Iran has since suspended ties with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, following the attacks. One of the three countries opting to trigger the snapback mechanism would renew sanctions on Iran, but Tehran renewing cooperation with the IAEA and addressing concerns about its highly-enriched uranium stockpile would delay it, according to a diplomat who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity following July’s meeting in Istanbul. Iran has had limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West and it is unclear how soon talks between Tehran and Washington for a deal over its nuclear program will resume. German Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher on Wednesday said the letter “once again underlines that the legal preconditions for snapback have long existed.” “Our position and our appeal is, very clearly, that Iran still has the choice of deciding to return to diplomacy … and full cooperation with the IAEA,” he told reporters at a regular news conference in Berlin. intelligence agencies and the IAEA had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Article: ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) has held above the key $4,000 level this week That shift was catalyzed by regulatory tailwinds that prompted a boom in institutional interest around stablecoins, which account for 40% of all blockchain fees and more than half of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain. In the last two and a half months, ETH treasury companies and ETFs have purchased 3.8% of all ETH in circulation, Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, pointed out in a note Wednesday. GENIUS Act, which clears the way for mainstream adoption of stablecoins, is a pivotal change" and "should also indirectly boost activity on Ethereum's layer 1 as increased stablecoin liquidity leads to more decentralized finance activity, where ETH dominates," Kendrick said. ETH gains also come after stablecoin issuer Circle's first earnings report , which showed a 53% jump in quarterly revenue on strong stablecoin growth, and ahead of the public trading debut of the crypto exchange Bullish, which has a focus on decentralized finance. Although ether has revisited this resistance mark a handful of times since 2021, it has been a challenging one psychologically and technically for traders and has not sustained it before now. When traders use leverage to short ETH and the coin's price rises, they buy ETH back from the market to close their positions, pushing the price up and causing more positions to be liquidated.

Article: Last week, actor Dean Cain, known for portraying Superman in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, announced that he was going to be sworn in as a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. He also posted an ICE recruitment video on Instagram with the Superman theme song playing in the background, and promoted the generous pay and benefits that come with being an ICE agent. But setting aside the irony that the Man of Steel himself was in fact also an undocumented alien, why would Superman be so keen to join ICE’s draconian raids targeting immigrants? The visuals of masked federal agents, hopping out of armoured vehicles, in military-style gear and swiftly descending on what ICE enthusiasts would claim are terrorists, rapists, paedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers and gang members, are deeply comforting for many in the US. This means that the development of the US criminal justice system has its roots not only in slavery, but also in the belief that slave revolts or any effort to upend the racial hierarchy in American society are an existential threat to the established social order. Whether it was the rise of organised crime during the Prohibition era of the 1920s, uprisings during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, or when President Richard Nixon declared drug addiction “public enemy no 1” requiring an “all-out offensive”, these have served as the pretext for strong, military-style policing on American streets. This militarisation of the police has been supported by Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, allowing local law enforcement agencies to access excess military equipment from the Department of Defense (DOD). The hard-edged, violent and brash cop, willing to stray outside the bounds of the law to protect innocent civilians from evil (the Muslim terrorist, the Soviets, the Germans) is a popular Hollywood and American TV show staple. This has normalised the perception that to keep America safe from such existential threats, it is sometimes necessary to use deadly force or extrajudicial actions, no matter how cruel or excessive they may seem. As an 18-year-old college student in upstate New York in the early 2000s, I was the physical epitome of all things evil and anti-American as the country waged its “Global War on Terror”. At the time, I remember a fellow student justifying the extra security checks I had to suffer through at airports, saying, “You cannot ignore the fact that you look like the people who hate us.” In my late 20s as a PhD student in Copenhagen, I had to hear a senior colleague say, “You’re Indian. Globally, we have also seen a proliferation of reality TV shows like Border Security: Australia’s Front Line and Nothing to Declare UK that claim to show the reality of the multiple threats that Western countries encounter at their borders. That said, in the same year, he also signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, allowing undocumented migrants who were brought into the country as minors to apply for “renewable two-year periods of deferred action from deportation, allowing them to remain in the country”. That said, during Trump’s tenure in the White House, the anti-immigrant rhetoric has been vicious, and the Republican leader does not shy away from portraying migrants as synonymous with criminality and an existential threat to the demographic, moral and cultural fabric of the United States. This framing of immigrants as a problematic presence in American society served as a pretext for Trump’s plan to build a wall across the US-Mexico border to stop the movement of undocumented migrants, the travel ban on citizens from several Muslim countries, and a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Program. With the genocide ongoing in Gaza and the concurrent visibility of the Palestine solidarity movement, the anti-immigration movement has merged with anti-Palestinian racism, with ICE also targeting pro-Palestine activists whom the Trump administration claims hold views that are antithetical to American values. With all of this in the background, it then makes sense that an actor who once played an undocumented alien on TV and who himself has Japanese heritage would join ICE.

Article: Abuja and Nasarawa, Nigeria – In the neighbourhood of Kado Lifecamp on the outskirts of Nigeria’s capital, 29-year-old Eucharia Joseph grips a cooler box and sets out for her day. With ongoing insecurity in northern Nigeria and pockets of resistance elsewhere, the job of eradicating polio now rests heavily on the shoulders of women like Joseph, who are often the only ones granted access to households due to a confluence of cultural, religious and safety reasons. Such rumours about the effects of vaccines have circulated for years, often fanned by misinformation circulating among community networks, some religious leaders, and occasionally by armed groups such as Boko Haram, which has attacked vaccinators and portrayed immunisation as part of a foreign agenda. “That’s the best approach for the government to use for creating more awareness about [the need and effectiveness of] polio vaccines.” In areas or situations where male vaccinators face access constraints and restrictions, women doing the work have been more effective. This is especially true for conflict-affected areas of northern Nigeria where women are often the only ones allowed into households – especially those with young children – making their role irreplaceable,” said Dr Ndoutabe Modjirom, coordinator of WHO-led polio outbreaks rapid response team for the African region. “I manage it by separating my time to work [as a health worker] and do business.” Advertisement While the campaigns has improved public health outcomes, it has also unintentionally created a foundation for economic empowerment among women, many say. “Vaccination campaigns have opened a pathway for leadership, agency, and financial independence.” Helen Bulus, a government health officer in charge of vaccinations in Mararaba town in Nasarawa, reflects on the sense of commitment female health workers share. “As mothers become more economically stable, they invest more in their daughters’ futures.” A global model – with challenges While wild polio now remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Nigeria’s experience offers vital lessons.

Article: The letter, sent to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, said the three European powers were “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets a deadline to speak with them. “We have made it clear that if Iran is not willing to reach a diplomatic solution before the end of August 2025, or does not seize the opportunity of an extension, E3 are prepared to trigger the snapback mechanism,” the ministers wrote, the AFP news agency reported on Wednesday. Iran had been in talks with the United States at the time over its nuclear programme, before Washington later carried out its own bombing raid on Iran’s nuclear sites during the conflict. The foreign ministers of the so-called E3 group wrote to the UN on Tuesday, raising the prospect of “snapback” sanctions – a provision in a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that eased UN Security Council measures in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities. The letter follows what the E3 described as “serious, frank and detailed” discussions with Iran in Istanbul last month, the first in-person talks since Israeli and US strikes targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The European powers pledged to uphold the agreement but now claim Iran has breached its terms, including building a uranium stockpile more than 40 times the limit set in 2015. Meanwhile, Iran has agreed to hold talks with the IAEA and is preparing to host a visit by the UN watchdog, its first since Tehran cut ties with the agency last month following the June conflict.

Article: 27, Trump announced an executive order titled “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness.” It states that, “expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.” The order then continues to say, “beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.” On May 6, after a court challenge, the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration the ability to move forward with the order. That same day, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, delivered a keynote speech at Special Operations Forces Week 2025, that was clipped and posted in a public video on the verified X account for DOD Rapid Response, and said, “We are leaving wokeness and weakness behind. A transcript posted on the DOD’s website on the same day, that cited a “Senior Defense Official” without listing their name, explained that those who chose to leave would be compensated based on “rank as well as time in service.” The DOD transcript explained further, that all transgender personnel who leave because of this will receive some benefits, but that it is greater for those who start the process on their own accord. The way the voluntary separation pay is calculated is a multiple of two from the involuntary, so that E-5 with 10 years would be approximately $101,000 and the O-3 with seven years in service would be approximately $125,000,” the transcript said. 7, however, it was reported by NBC News that the Air Force is denying early retirement to all transgender service members with between 15 and 18 years of military service, opting instead to force them out with no retirement benefits, according to a memo seen by Reuters. They are not tied specifically to the implementation of this policy.” Savoie told NBC San Diego they chose to stay, and not begin that voluntary separation process, as an act of resistance. We don’t know what they’re going to do to us right now.” Savoie said they do have concerns for the future, including which separation code will be used for them if they are forced to leave the Marines and how that could impact their future employment opportunities. NBC San Diego reached out to Savoie’s command and the public affairs team for the USMC Manpower and Reserve Affairs office for more information on their status, as well as the status of other transgender servicemembers. When it comes to how many servicemembers, including Savoie, may be impacted by Trump's executive order, in that transcript, the unnamed senior defense official said, “the Department has cited a previous study that estimated approximately 4,200 service members with gender dysphoria. And of course, that may not be current as of today because service members are entering and departing service in the normal course of events all the time.” Savoie echoed that, saying “there’s not great numbers on how many transgender people are in the military." "From the communities that I am a part of and my experience working and connecting with other trans service members, I would guesstimate there’s maybe seven or eight transgender officers in the Marine Corps," they said. Others are taking the retirement and just kind of want to gracefully exit because they’ve already done their part and they’ve had to fight their fights under the first ban, and they’re tired.” If it were up to Savoie — who has continues to show up for work each day, unsure of what comes next — they said they would serve until their EAS, or end of active service, in 2028.

Riots across England and Northern Ireland last summer were partly triggered by misinformation on social media, which said the man responsible for the murder of three girls in Southport was an illegal migrant. When a car drove into a crowd at a bus parade for Liverpool FC in the city in May, police were quick to say a white man had been arrested over the incident to defuse any trouble.

Article: A study recently published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when asked to rank actions, such as swapping a car that uses gasoline for an electric one, carpooling or reducing food waste, participants weren’t very accurate when assessing how much those actions contributed to climate change, which is caused mostly by the release of greenhouse gases that happen when fuels like gasoline, oil and coal are burned. "People over-assign impact to actually pretty low-impact actions such as recycling, and underestimate the actual carbon impact of behaviors much more carbon intensive, like flying or eating meat," said Madalina Vlasceanu, report co-author and professor of environmental social sciences at Stanford University. “There has been a lot of deliberate confusion out there to support policies that are really out of date," said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.

Goldman Sachs also pointed out that this latest run to all-time highs coincides with increased retail participation by Main Street investors — which could signal it's time to delve into meme stocks once again. "Recent weeks have seen a resumption of retail buying activity in S & P 500 and [Nasdaq] 100 stocks, and we believe the meme stock resurgence has spread into the broader buying of large-cap stocks," strategist John Marshall wrote. According to Goldman, among the S & P 500 stocks that have seen high retail participation over the past month in terms of net retail activity are the following: Palantir — $1.2 billion AMD — $774 million KeyCorp — $163 million Electronic Arts — $42 million Albemarle — $19 million UPS — $123 million Warner Bros Discovery — $167 million Marshall recommended clients buy call options on these stocks with high retail participation.

Article: As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares for a summit in Alaska with his United States counterpart Donald Trump, he can draw on his experiences from 48 previous meetings with American presidents. While some of the earlier meetings were relatively warm, reflecting the hopes of US-Russia friendship between the end of the Cold War and the early 2000s, most of Putin’s more recent interactions — especially with Obama and Biden — have been frostier, as bilateral ties have worsened. Under President Putin, Russia has the chance to build prosperity and strength, while safeguarding that freedom and the rule of law,” Clinton said, referring to Boris Yeltsin, Putin’s predecessor as president. But Clinton acknowledged their differences over Chechnya, where Russian forces had launched a major war the previous year, after a series of apartment blasts in Russia killed more than 300 people. The Moscow meeting was the first of four between Putin and Clinton in 2000, the others on the margins of multilateral events, before the US president left office in January the following year. Now the high school students can know Russia as a friend; that we’re working together to break the old ties, to establish a new spirit of cooperation and trust so that we can work together to make the world more peaceful,” Bush said. April 2008: Putin-Bush The final meeting between Bush and Putin as presidents took place in Sochi, Russia, and was focused on US plans to expand a missile defence system in Europe that Russia was opposing. “We may not end up agreeing on everything, but I think that we can have a tone of mutual respect and consultation that will serve both the American people and the Russian people well,” Obama told Putin. June 2013: Putin-Obama As Obama met Putin on the margins of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland — Russia had been added to the grouping in 1998 and was expelled in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea — their frustration with each other was visible in an awkward photo that made headlines. “With respect to Syria, we do have differing perspectives on the problem, but we share an interest in reducing the violence; securing chemical weapons and ensuring that they’re neither used nor are they subject to proliferation,” Obama said. Putin and Obama spoke for barely four minutes on the sidelines of the summit, with the US president asking his Russian counterpart to stick to his commitments under the Minsk agreements that were meant to bring peace to Ukraine. July 2018: Putin-Trump A year and a half into his first presidency, Trump’s victory in the 2016 US presidential election was still clouded by accusations that Russia had interfered in the election on his behalf when he met Putin in Helsinki. After he acknowledged that he had discussed the allegations of election interference with Putin, Trump was asked whether he believed US intelligence agencies that had concluded that Moscow had intervened in the vote. But Biden was also blunt with Putin about US concerns over Russian election interference and cyberattacks, and said he had, in effect, threatened Moscow that Washington could launch tit-for-tat cyberstrikes. Russia by then was building up its troop presence along the border with Ukraine, a key source of stress in ties with the US that came up during the Putin-Biden meeting. Eight months later, Russia would launch a fully fledged invasion of Ukraine, marking the start of Europe’s largest war since World War II — a war Trump says he wants to end through the summit in Alaska on August 15.

Article: BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday will consider an unprecedented lawsuit in which the Trump administration sued all 15 Maryland-based federal judges over a standing order related to deportation cases. The case is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's war on the judiciary, which has been marked by criticism of judges who have ruled against the government over President Donald Trump's bold and aggressive use of executive power. At issue is a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that set rules for handling cases involving immigrants facing immediate risk of deportation. One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country before eventually being returned, arose in Maryland. In court filings, Justice Department lawyers under Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the order "harms the federal government's sovereign interests on a repeated and ongoing basis" because it applies even when the immigrant may have no valid legal argument or the court has no jurisdiction over the case.

Article: In a lawsuit filed in a Texas federal district court, Baylor is taking issue with Boston University's use of an "interlocking BU design" that is nearly identical to the Waco university's long-standing logo. Baylor has used the same interlocking BU logo since at least 1912, according to the filing, and has multiple federal and state trademark registrations for it covering clothing, merchandise, and more. Boston University has expanded its use of the interlocking logo in the years since, featuring it on more merchandise and equipment for club sports such as cycling, sailing, rugby, and volleyball. Baylor is asking the court to permanently bar Boston University from using the design and to order the Massachusetts school to destroy any goods, advertisements, or online content featuring the logo, as per the lawsuit.

Article: In its absence, the president can paint the world as he pleases.” The same report added, “Curating reality is an old political game, but Trump’s sweeping statistical purges are part of a broader attempt to reinvent ‘truth.’” It’s difficult to do a full accounting of what has gone missing, but we know the list includes climate data, education data, trade data and crime data — all of which has been buried, deliberately, because the figures were deemed politically inconvenient. The Washington Post reported: President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics told Fox News Digital on Monday that the agency should suspend monthly jobs reports, a change that could leave businesses and policymakers at least temporarily without the data they’ve used for decades to gauge the state of the labor market and broader economy. “Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data,” Antoni said, referring to recent revisions to monthly reports. rely on these numbers, and a lack of confidence in the data has far-reaching consequences.” (Antoni’s interview with Fox News Digital was apparently taped on Monday but published Tuesday, after Trump announced that he was nominating the Heritage Foundation economist to lead the BLS.) The argument is badly flawed, in part because releasing the data quarterly, instead of monthly, leaves everyone in the dark for much of the year, and in part because of the underlying motivation: If the goal is to address “a lack of confidence in the data,” the president wouldn’t have fired a highly qualified and widely respected BLS chief in the first place, only to replace her with an unqualified partisan loyalist. Nevertheless, after Antoni’s comments to Fox News Digital circulated, a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt whether the administration would, in fact, start limiting public access to U.S. “Well, look, what I’ll tell you about the Bureau of Labor Statistics — I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said. “And there has certainly been a decline in the quality and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there’s been an increase in revisions,” Leavitt added. Third, the White House continues to talk about revisions to government statistics in a way that makes it seem as if Trump administration officials don’t understand the underlying policy details at a basic level. In recent weeks, many have voiced concerns about the president and his team possibly manipulating official data, but now there’s a new concern: What if they limit access to the data for months on end?

Advertisement “Ali Larijani has been using more diplomatic language than … a few days ago [when] he was blunt that Iran opposes the Lebanese government’s decision to disarm Hezbollah.” “He said that Iran’s policy is about friendly cooperation, not giving orders and timetables, so he was referring to the United States, the US envoy, which presented a plan to end tensions with Israel, and that plan involves disarming Hezbollah [on] a four-month timetable.” A ‘state-by-state’ relationship Dozens of Hezbollah supporters gathered along the airport road to welcome Larijani on Wednesday morning. “If … the Lebanese people are suffering, we in Iran will also feel this pain and we will stand by the dear people of Lebanon in all circumstances,” Larijani told reporters shortly after landing in Beirut. “What the new Lebanese leadership wants is a state-by-state relationship, not like in the past where … the Iranians would be dealing with Hezbollah and not [with] the Lebanese state,” said Khodr.

Article: Teen influencer on fundraising mission stranded in Antarctica since landing without permission SANTIAGO, Chile -- What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with "false flight plan data." Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q - a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge's ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was "relieved by the outcome." For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. "I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission." The prosecutor's office said Guo must also pay all costs for his "aircraft security and personal maintenance" during his stay at the military facility.

The European champions did offer Donnarumma a new deal this summer, but on Tuesday head coach Luis Enrique explained that he is now looking for a "different profile" of goalkeeper. That is a claim denied by those at the Parc des Princes, who believe the salary offered would have made Donnarumma one of the highest paid goalkeepers in the world. Both sides now hope a transfer away can avoid any escalation in tension, and the French champions will want a fee to profit on what was a free transfer four years ago.

Article: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli gunfire killed at least 25 people seeking aid Wednesday, health officials and witnesses said, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will “allow” Palestinians to leave during an upcoming military offensive in Gaza. President Donald Trump’s vision of relocating much of Gaza’s population of over 2 million people through what the prime minister refers to as “voluntary migration” — and what critics have warned could be ethnic cleansing. First, from combat zones, and also from the Strip if they want,” Netanyahu said in an interview aired Tuesday with i24, an Israeli TV station, to discuss the planned offensive in some of the territory’s most populated areas including Gaza City. “We are not pushing them out but allowing them to leave.” READ MORE: Israel is in talks to possibly resettle Palestinians from Gaza in South Sudan Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals, which received the bodies, said people were killed on their way to aid distribution sites and while awaiting convoys entering the strip. Israel has said it will widen its military offensive against Hamas to the areas of Gaza that it does not yet control, where most of the territory’s residents have sought refuge. Netanyahu was asked by i24 News if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal and he responded that he wanted all of the hostages back, alive and dead. Egyptian Foreign Ministry Badr Abdelatty told reporters that Cairo is still trying to advance an earlier proposal for an initial 60-day ceasefire, the release of some hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid before further talks on a lasting truce. Hamas has long called for a comprehensive deal but says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The office of Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Sharren Haskel, said Wednesday that she was arriving in South Sudan for a series of meetings in the first visit by a senior government official to the country, but she did not plan to broach the subject of moving Palestinians. Killed while seeking aid Among those killed while seeking aid Wednesday were 14 Palestinians in the Teina area approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from a food distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to staff at Nasser hospital. Gaza’s Health Ministry says 106 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war and 129 adults have died since late June when the ministry started to count deaths among this age group. and its humanitarian partners are doing everything possible to bring aid into Gaza, Dujarric said, but still face significant delays and impediments from Israeli authorities who prevent the delivery of food and other essentials at the scale needed. The offensive has killed more than 61,700 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.

According to Jasmine Escalera, a career expert at Zety and the author of the report, the data aligns with what she's been hearing from job seekers and seeing on social media. "We know that it's a challenging and tough job market, and we've been hearing for a while that many job seekers are having a hard time landing positions," Escalera says. "But job seekers can maybe breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief and say, 'OK, it really isn't just me.'" A "recipe for disaster" According to Zety's report, workers currently face a number of obstacles in the job search, including vague job listings, slow application and interview timelines, increased competition for the same roles and being "ghosted" during the process. "Companies have the upper hand, which is unfortunate, and I think they're using that to their advantage by lowering salaries."

Right now, networking should be "top of mind," according to Escalera: "My advice for anyone in this job market right now is really focus on human to human interactions."

Bathed in sunshine, dozens of demonstrators drank tea, ate cake featuring a meme of the vice president’s face and held up humorous placards Tuesday in the small community in the Cotswolds, as this part of the countryside is known. Leon Neal / Getty Images “JD Vance Netflix password is ‘password,’” said one handmade sign at a protest near where the Vances are vacationing some 100 miles west of the capital, London. “Cotswolds childless cat ladies say go home,” another read, referring to comments Vance made to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021 about senior Democrats in Congress that resurfaced during last year’s presidential race. Leon Neal / Getty Images In the nearby town of Chipping Norton, some locals said they were unprepared for the level of security disruption as some of the already tight roads in the area were closed for Vance’s motorcade. Design manager Geoff Holliday, 51, said Wednesday he was “getting bored” with the closures, adding that he was longing for the motorcade to be slowed down by “a disgruntled farmer and a combine harvester.” Nestled among the rolling hills that rise up from meadows of the upper River Thames, the Cotswolds’ picture-postcard towns and villages have been popular with holidaymakers for centuries.

Article: CRWV 1D mountain CRWV, 1-day Some analysts said that the move lower could be tied to lock-up expiration effective at the close of the market on Thursday – when insiders will be allowed to start selling shares following the company's March initial public offering – which could also affect CoreWeave's planned takeover of Core Scientific . "This could have direct implications for the announced all-stock acquisition of CORZ as the implied valuation is directly tied to the performance of CRWV's stock," said Citizens JMP analyst Greg Miller, who rates CoreWeave a market perform. "As such, we believe any downward pressure resulting from increased share supply or insider selling could affect the deal dynamics and increase investor opposition." While the lock-up expiration adds one element of uncertainty, investors may also be questioning CoreWeave's operating cash flow and planned capital spending, which "again disappointed in-quarter," Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow (equal weight) said. "Bottom line, accruing and expanding large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provide strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning for the ramping GPU build-out, broadening the customer base likely proves key to increasing investor confidence in the durability of this growth. … While we remain on the sidelines awaiting further evidence of the broadening of the software story at CoreWeave, for investors with strong conviction in the build-out of the GPU economy and longer-term investment horizons, CRWV should be considered as a core holding." JPMorgan: Overweight, $135 Analyst Mark Murphy's target calls for more than 9% downside compared with where CoreWeave closed Tuesday. Though a strong revenue performance, the booking/capex figures were not as spectacular with incremental backlog additions (ex previously announced OpenAI contract) at just $200M, while profitability was mixed (EBIT beat but EBIT $s reiterated for the full year on higher spending). That said, guidance implies a significant ramp in capex/revenue acceleration in Q4 which is likely driven by Blackwell and significant data capacity online, which we see as a positive catalyst ahead. … we'd expect shares to be volatile but expect weakness to be bought with AI demand remaining strong and revenue acceleration ahead." Bank of America: neutral, $168 Analyst Brad Sills' target implies about 13% upside. "While the magnitudes of the Q2 topline beat and Q3 raise were slightly below the Q1 print, results were solid, validating that CoreWeave remains well positioned as a leading AI infrastructure vendor. … the lockup expires on Friday, which is likely to place pressure on the shares … we believe CoreWeave remains well positioned to benefit from a ramping AI infrastructure industry." Stifel: hold, $120 Analyst Ruben Roy's target would equal more than 19% downside. "We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday."

Article: The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced a new "PreCheck" program, which will use a two-phase approach to help boost domestic drug manufacturing after it shrunk dramatically over the past two decades. The White House also estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it previously called "unacceptable from a national-security standpoint." "Our gradual overreliance on foreign drug manufacturing has created national security risks," FDA Commissioner Dr. "The FDA PreCheck initiative is one of many steps FDA is taking that can help reverse America's reliance on foreign drug manufacturing and ensure that Americans have a resilient, strong, and domestic drug supply." Here's how the two phases of the program work: Facility Readiness Phase: Drugmakers will be able to engage more frequently with the FDA at "critical development stages" such as facility design, construction and pre-construction, the agency said. Application Submission Phase: The agency said this step would involve the FDA and drugmakers holding pre-application meetings and giving early feedback to resolve issues and streamline assessments of "quality information in a drug application and inspections." (That is referring to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC, section of an application, which provides a comprehensive overview on the drug substance, its manufacturing process and controls in place to ensure its quality and stability.)

Article: Turkiye has said that Israel and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) must stop threatening the security and stability of Syria as Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan hosted his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara. Speaking at a joint news conference on Wednesday, Fidan accused Israel and the SDF of wilfully undermining the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the ouster of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive. “If you try to destabilise these countries, if you take steps to that end, this could trigger other crises in the region.” Al-Shaibani said Israel’s actions “undermine the security of our citizens,” adding that “certain countries want Syria to disintegrate based on ideologies, based on ethnicity, and obviously we are against all these efforts”. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s fledgling government has been beset by heavy fallout from sectarian violence that broke out on July 13 in the southern province of Suwayda between Bedouin and Druze fighters. Israel had been regularly bombarding Syria and staging ground excursions into Syria since al-Assad’s ouster, saying it was targeting weapons sites and branding the leaders of the new government as “extremists”. The clashes cast further doubt over an integration deal signed in March by the armed group and Syria’s Damascus as part of efforts to reunite the country, devastated and divided by the ruinous war that saw hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced. The Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that the SDF must abide by that accord and stop targeting government forces, warning that “the continuation of these actions will lead to new consequences”, the SANA state news agency reported. Fidan accused the SDF of trying to turn instability in Syria into an “opportunity for themselves.” Ankara views the SDF with hostility as the group is spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG) affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that recently began disarmament as part of a peace process with Turkiye after more than 40 years of fighting in a conflict that killed more than 40,000 people. ”The upper echelons of the YPG need to stop playing for time because the chaos they’re waiting for [in Syria] will not take place, and even if it does, it will not be to their advantage.” Fidan said.

The group show was to have included works inspired by Gosine’s 2021 book, “Nature’s Wild: Love, Sex and Law in the Caribbean,” which reflects on art, activism and homosexuality in the region. The same month, Arizona’s Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art made eleventh-hour edits to a traveling exhibition of women, queer and trans artists, which had previously been called “transfeminisms,” altering the title of its condensed show to “There are other skies.” Marinna Shareef with Andil Gosine's "God of Whimsy" https://www.paulpetro.com/exhibitions/674-nature-s-wild-with-andil-gosine In April, the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art postponed a group exhibition of works by LGBTQ African artists titled “Here: Pride and Belonging in African Art,” which had been scheduled for a late May opening to coincide with WorldPride. museum cited budgetary reasons for postponing the show to 2026, but the timing was hard to miss on the heels of Trump administration directives to the Smithsonian to remove “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from its museums — as well as the forced and pre-emptive relocation of other WorldPride cultural events after Trump administration firings at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Katz was the lead curator for “The First Homosexuals: The Birth of a New Identity, 1869-1939,” the vast and successful historical survey of LGBTQ art that ran through early July at Chicago’s Wrightwood 659 Gallery. Katz traces the roots of modern queer art censorship to the controversial Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition “The Perfect Moment,” which — with its provocative imagery, much of it homoerotic — became a cultural lightning rod at the height of the Reagan/Bush-era culture wars in 1989-90. Al Behrmann / AP file Central to the cancellation of Sherald’s show was her painting “Trans Forming Liberty,” which features a Black trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty. After she learned that the National Portrait Gallery had “internal concerns” about the painting and planned to replace or supplement it with a video to provide “both sides” of its trans subject matter, Sherald balked and canceled her entire show, which would have been the museum’s first solo exhibition by a Black contemporary artist. “While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald, who rose to fame when she painted former first lady Michelle Obama’s official portrait, said in a statement after the cancellation. “At a time when transgender people are being legislated against, silenced, and endangered across our nation, silence is not an option.” After the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, which oversees the gallery, disputed Sherald’s claims and said that the institution wanted more time to better contextualize the painting but that Sherald canceled before that could be done. “She’s willing to do it, she’s got the strength to do it, and I think it’s extraordinary.” The National Portrait Gallery is one of eight Smithsonian museums targeted as part of the first phase of an expansive review announced by the Trump administration on Tuesday. The review will analyze all aspects of current and future museum exhibitions to ensure alignment with the president’s March executive order calling for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” Gustave Caillebotte's "Boat Party" is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. Sophie Crépy / Musée d’Orsay In June, across town from “The First Homosexuals,” the Art Institute of Chicago opened a traveling exhibition of 19th century French artist Gustave Caillebotte’s male-focused and arguably homoerotic work, changing the show’s name from “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men” to “Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World.” Wall texts accompanying the artworks at the Art Institute take a more general approach than they had at the exhibition’s previous incarnations at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, where frank discussions of gender and sexuality were included. “That one was particularly galling, because not only did the show coincide with my show, but I wrote for the catalog of that exhibition precisely how one talks about same-sex desire in Caillebotte’s work,” Katz said. We’re asking them to leave open the possibility, and to foreground the blurriness of these questions in the late 19th century.” In a statement to NBC News, the Art Institute of Chicago said its “Painting His World” title is more illustrative of what people will see when they come to the exhibition, which “reflects Caillebotte’s full lived experience and daily life, including his personal relationships with the men in his life, like his brother, colleagues, and friends.” The institute added that it’s “common practice” for the same exhibition to have differing titles and wall labels when it’s at different museums. The Smithsonian National Museum of African Art — which was not included in the Trump administration’s Phase I review — said in a statement on Tuesday that the postponement of its LGBTQ exhibition was due to private funding challenges and that pushing it back to early 2026 “provide the museum additional time to increase fundraising for the exhibit.” The Art Museum of the Americas and Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art did not immediately respond to NBC News’ requests for comment regarding their canceled and altered exhibits. “So I think it’s about trying to pacify a class of oligarchs that by and large run these museums, for whom questions of explicit uncensored sexuality are frankly anathema to their values.” Fortunately for Katz and Willis — and Chicago audiences — the innovative exhibition space Wrightwood 659, just seven years old and committed to presenting socially engaged art, stepped up to host “The First Homosexuals” when virtually every other American museum turned it down. “Rave reviews, the last two months were sold out, waiting lists of 100-plus people — I mean, everything a museum could want, and yet no.” Instead, the exhibition will travel next to Switzerland’s Kunstmuseum Basel, where it will open in the spring. 25; and in Los Angeles, the Getty Center has a double feature of queer shows, “Queer Lens: A History of Photography” and $3 Bill: Evidence of Queer Lives, both on view through Sept. “These exhibitions do what we always hope an exhibition will do — bring visibility to lesser-known histories through the display of art to the public,” said Timothy Potts, director of the J.

Article: Lammy admits licence error on JD Vance fishing trip 44 minutes ago Share Save Joshua Nevett Political reporter Share Save Reuters Foreign Secretary David Lammy has admitted he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance and has blamed the oversight on an "administrative error". The agency says anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod fishing licence to fish for freshwater species and can be fined if they do not have one. The two men went carp fishing in a pond near the 17th-century house before they held talks about Gaza and other international affairs at the residence during Vance's family holiday to the UK. At the start of their meeting, the vice-president said: "Unfortunately, the one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not." All fish that were caught were returned to the private lake. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "The foreign secretary has written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week.

Article: President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social is a safe space for him and his movement, an autocrat-friendly network where the president’s posts — which are called “truths” on the platform — are praised effusively and largely go uncontested. I'm wondering how long it'll take before Truth Social will want to tell its AI: "You're fired." In exchanges with a Washington Post reporter, Truth Search AI undermined Trump by saying that "tariffs are a tax on Americans, the 2020 election wasn’t stolen, and his family’s cryptocurrency investments pose a potential conflict of interest." When asked to verify Trump's claim on Truth Social that crime in Washington, D.C., is "totally out of control," the bot cited government statistics and said there were in reality "substantial declines in violent crime" in D.C. Capitol by a pro‑Trump crowd that disrupted Congress’s certification of the 2020 Electoral College results, resulting in assaults on police, injuries, property damage, and hundreds of criminal cases ranging from misdemeanors to felonies." When I asked if it was appropriate to describe that as an insurrection or a coup, it responded, "Based on standard definitions, January 6 is best described as an attempted insurrection rather than a successful coup; it can also be framed as a failed coup attempt because the goal was to disrupt the lawful transfer of presidential power, but it lacked the organized seizure of state levers typical of coups." Surprisingly reasonable! The Washington Post reports that a spokesman for the AI company Perplexity, which developed the chat bot, said that "Truth Social had used a 'source selection' feature to limit the websites the AI tool relied on but that Perplexity did not know which websites those were." As a casual user experimenting with the product, I don't know either. But I did notice that in the "sources" section of the responses, the sources listed were almost always Fox News and The Washington Times, both right-wing outlets, and a far narrower range of sources than I've seen cited by other AI chatbots such as X's Grok. Elon Musk's quest to develop "anti-woke AI" involved turning his AI, Grok, into a full-fledged Nazi apologist and at the same time one that will deliver conventional liberal summaries of racism. The thing that stands out here is how out of place Truth Social's AI centrist- and liberal-friendly descriptions of events and policy feel on a platform awash in MAGA propaganda.

Article: Jan Hatzius has been Goldman Sachs’ chief economist for quite some time — he correctly warned, for example, about the systemic risks of mortgage defaults ahead of the 2008 crash — which has raised his public profile. The Wall Street Journal reported: President Trump on Tuesday appeared to call for Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon to replace the bank’s top economist over his past predictions, in his latest broadside against executives he believes are undermining his goals. Trump said on his Truth Social social-media platform that Solomon should ‘go out and get himself a new Economist’ because the bank made a ‘bad prediction a long time ago’ on the market and tariffs. As part of the same online missive, the Republican also wrote, “Trillions of Dollars are being taken in on Tariffs.” To the extent that reality still has any meaning, tariffs have generated some revenue — roughly $152 billion through July — but to suggest this figure is “trillions of dollars” is bonkers. They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else.” For now, let’s not dwell on the fact that Trump’s agenda is failing; or that “crediting” a president for failing doesn’t make any sense; or that the administration’s own data suggests Goldman Sachs’ assessments related to tariffs haven’t been “wrong” at all. The record suggests Hatzius has been correct — but even if he’d been wrong, it’s not Trump’s job to tell Goldman Sachs who should and shouldn’t serve as the bank’s chief economist. The Journal published a separate analysis last week that noted the Republican “has no qualms about acting as the micromanager in chief,” which includes “telling corporate bosses how to run their companies.” I haven’t seen any evidence that Goldman Sachs is taking Trump’s bizarre advice seriously, but the fact that the president even issued such a public statement was a timely reminder about his maximalist assumptions regarding the scope of his powers: Trump doesn’t just see himself as the head of the executive branch, he also apparently sees himself as the CEO of America.

Article: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has convened the virtual meetings in an attempt to make sure European and Ukraine’s leaders are heard ahead of the summit in Alaska, where Trump and Putin are expected to discuss a path toward ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine. German government spokesperson Steffen Meyer said the intention of Wednesday’s meetings was to “make clear the position of the Europeans.” Zelenskyy is due to meet with European leaders first, in preparation for a virtual call with Trump and Vice President JD Vance about an hour later. A call among leaders of countries involved in the “coalition of the willing” — those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv — will take place last. The Ukrainian leader on Wednesday said his government has had over 30 conversations with partners ahead of the summit in Alaska, but reiterated his doubt that Putin would negotiate in good faith. Writing on his official Telegram channel, Zelenskyy said there was “currently no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,” and urged Ukraine’s partners in the United States and Europe to coordinate efforts and “force Russia to peace.” “Pressure must be applied on Russia for an honest peace. The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. READ MORE: Zelenskyy says Putin wants the rest of Ukraine’s Donetsk region as part of a ceasefire Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something that Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts. Ukrainian drones struck the Unecha station which supplies the Russian army, the statement said, adding that damage and a large fire was reported in the area around the pumping station.

In 2024 Bodhana was thought to have become the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport when she was selected for England Women's Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary. Her father Siva previously told the BBC he had no idea where his daughter got her talent from as neither he or his wife, both engineering graduates, are any good at chess. The International Chess Federation said on its social media account on X that Bodhana "pulled off the win against 60-year-old Grandmaster Peter Wells in the last round of the 2025 British Chess Championships in Liverpool". The federation added: "Sivanandan's victory at 10 years, five months and three days beats the 2019 record held by American Carissa Yip (10 years, 11 months and 20 days)." Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain and the rank is held for life. "When it was 2020, it was Covid, so one of my dad's friends was going back to India, and he had a few toys and books, and he gave them to us. He said: "I try to trace down whether any of my cousins or anyone plays - nobody has any chess energy or chess-playing skills, no one played for any chess events." He added: "Overall we are happy with whatever is happening. Bodhana played several games simultaneously at Chess Fest 2024 in Trafalgar Square Malcolm Payne, an international chess master who runs a charity that's brought the game to a quarter-of-a-million state school children, said Bodhana was blazing a trail for girls and women in what has traditionally been a man's game. And certainly I believe that she's on course to become a grandmaster." Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

There are concerns as well that the impact of tariffs will flow further onto grocery stores into other products. That could be further amplified by the cuts to the SNAP program by the Big Beautiful Bill, all of which is leading to lower forecasts from retailers, according to Heather Rice, who leads the consumer, retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, and life science practice at KPMG.

Article: Clashes have erupted as opponents and supporters of the Serbian government faced off, each side staging its own demonstrations, as sustained protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic have now gone on for more than nine months. The clashes first began on Tuesday night in Vrbas, northwest of the capital Belgrade, where riot police separated the two groups outside the governing Serbian Progressive Party offices in the town. The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 16 people, triggering furious accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects. Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, but Vucic has maintained strong ties with Russia and China, and has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms since coming to power 13 years ago.

Article: At least 123 Palestinians, including 21 people seeking aid, have been killed and 437 others were injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hour reporting period, according to the Health Ministry in the besieged territory. In the same period, at least eight people, including three children, died from Israeli-imposed starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total number of hunger-related deaths since the war began in October, 2023 to 235, among them 106 children, the ministry said on Wednesday. “This is in addition to: over 40,000 children reported killed or injured due to bombardment and airstrikes, at least 17,000 unaccompanied and separated children, and one million deeply traumatised children and out of education,” he wrote in a post on X. No one should stay silent when children die, or are brutally deprived of a future, wherever these children are, including in Gaza.” Ceasefire talks to restart As the death toll continues to rise in Gaza, a delegation from the Palestinian group Hamas was scheduled to begin discussions in Egypt over a potential ceasefire on Wednesday. The previous round of indirect ceasefire talks in Qatar ended in deadlock in late July, after Israel and the United States withdrew their delegations hours after Hamas submitted its response to a truce proposal. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the news agency Reuters that “Hamas believes negotiation is the only way to end the war and is open to discuss any ideas that would secure an end to the war”. Advertisement A Hamas representative also told Reuters the group was willing to hand over governance of Gaza to a non-partisan committee, but would not give up its weapons before a Palestinian state is established. Israeli military plan to seize Gaza City Israel’s security cabinet last week approved plans to take control of Gaza City, despite international condemnation from the United Nations and dissent from within Israel’s own military. However, earlier Wednesday, the military said its chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, had signed off on the “main framework” for the operational plan during a meeting with top commanders, Shin Bet representatives and senior officers. According to the statement, Zamir “emphasised the importance of increasing troop readiness and preparedness for reserve recruitment, while conducting proficiency training and providing breathing space ahead of the upcoming missions”. “Seven people were reported killed overnight from a mixture of heavy artillery and air strikes targeting major residential clusters.” In the city’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, three more people were reportedly killed as they fled the area. Mahmoud said the Zikim crossing, the main entry point for aid in northern Gaza, had become “deadly for Palestinians”, with limited aid trucks allowed through despite crowds of desperate people. Aid restrictions criticised Foreign ministers from 24 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and Japan, said on Tuesday the humanitarian crisis in Gaza had reached “unimaginable levels” and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid into the enclave. But UNRWA says 500–600 trucks of aid are needed daily, but that aid getting into the Strip remains a fraction of that figure – while many Palestinians are killed on their way to collect aid.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump, embracing his new role as chairman of the Kennedy Center, was set to be on hand Wednesday as the recipients of its annual award are announced and both he and the performing arts venue hint at coming renovations to its building. He said work was being done on the site that would be “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. In a statement on its social media feed, the Kennedy Center said it is “honored” to host Trump, who will be visiting for the third time since January, and hinted that he would announce a construction project. “We are also excited to be announcing this year’s INCREDIBLE slate of Kennedy Center Honorees.” Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” It is unclear how this year's honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...” In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Sylvester Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared that he would not attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill that Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Clashes erupted at protests in Serbia between opponents and supporters of the government in an escalation of tensions following more than nine months of persistent demonstrations against populist President Aleksandar Vucic. The skirmishes first started on Tuesday evening in Vrbas, northwest of the capital Belgrade, where riot police separated protesters from the opposing camps outside the governing Serbian Progressive Party offices in the town. The student-led protests in Serbia first started in November after a train station canopy collapsed in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 16 people and triggering accusations of corruption in state infrastructure projects. Vucic said at a news conference on Wednesday with Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker that pro-democracy protests in Serbia have been “very violent and were violent last night.” Serbia’s president, other government officials and pro-government media repeatedly have described the protesters as “terrorists,” though protests in Serbia since November have been largely peaceful.

Article: This is a high watermark for the European far right, a once fringe movement whose virulently anti-immigration, anti-Islam and culture-war politics were shunned by the mainstream just a decade ago. Today, these parties have developed deep ties with President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, who openly cite nationalists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as inspirations on policy and tactics. Tuesday’s polling milestone is “a sign of the power of populism, disinformation and the failure of established parties to understand what is happening,” said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy and international development at England’s University of Birmingham. Though the far right has been making gains for the past decade, Cheeseman believes the polls showing the far right leading Europe’s top three economies is “a first — at least in modern times.” Reform U.K. Ben Stansall / AFP - Getty Images There is no guarantee that London, Berlin and Paris will be ruled by far-right parties; these countries’ next elections are not until 2029, 2029 and 2027 respectively. The roots of the far-right surge lie in the world financial crisis of 2008, which prompted government to cut budgets for public services and lowered living standards, some experts say, compounded by the Arab Spring of 2011 that birthed civil war in Syria and a mass refugee crisis in Europe four years later. Michel Euler / AP file More recent societal stressors such as the coronavirus pandemic and war in Ukraine have further increased the allure of populism, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group.

Article: In the face of blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle on Wednesday stood by a controversial forecast that tariffs will begin to hit consumer wallets. "We stand by the results of this study," he said on "Squawk on the Street." "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two thirds of the cost." The source of the president's ire was a Goldman note over the weekend, authored by economist Elsie Peng, asserting that while exporters and businesses thus far have absorbed most of Trump's tariffs, that burden will switch in the months ahead to consumers. If that's the case, it will push the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's main inflation forecasting gauge, to 3.2% by the end of the year, excluding food and energy. "So those are our estimates, and I think actually, they're quite consistent with what many other economists have found." Of note, Mericle said Trump likely still will get at least some of the interest rate cuts he's been demanding of the Fed. "I don't think this will matter a whole lot to the Fed, because now they have a labor market to worry about, and I think that's going to be the dominant concern." Following modest gains reported this week for the consumer price index, and a weak July nonfarm payrolls report that featured sharp downward revisions to the prior two months, markets are pricing in cuts from the Fed at each of its three remaining meetings this year.

An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General found that the company designed Zelle "without critical safety features," which allegedly allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. "EWS knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud, and yet it failed to adopt basic safeguards to address these glaring flaws or enforce any meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks," a statement from the office read. The lawsuit alleged that Zelle became a "hub for fraudulent activity" because the registration process lacked verification steps and that EWS and its partner banks knew "for years" that fraud was spreading and did not take actionable steps to resolve it.

Article: An influential group of Eli Lilly insiders scooped up shares of the obesity drugmaker — a major show of confidence that has us warming back up to the beaten-up stock. If not for our trading restrictions, we would be repurchasing at least some of the shares we sold in late July at nearly $774 apiece, before the stock got crushed on disappointing trial data for its hotly anticipated obesity pill. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks and four other insiders at the company — two other executives and two members of the board of directors — purchased additional stock in the company. The buys were as follows, according to SEC filings: Ricks: $1,052,263.01 (1,632 shares at an average of $644.769 apiece) Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky: $634,405 (1,000 shares at an average of $634.405 apiece) Executive Ilya Yuffa: $783,762.5 (1,250 shares at an average of $627.01 apiece) Director Erik Erik Fyrwald: $1,005,242.35 (1,565 shares at an average of $642.32738 apiece) Director Gabrielle Sulzberger: $75,018.294 (117 shares at an average of $641.182 apiece) So, why does this matter? The CEO buying stock is one thing – yes, you only buy stock if you think it's going higher, but there is no denying that the CEO knows it will also send a positive signal to investors. A director can easily decide to not step in and nobody would bat an eye, especially a board member that is also the CEO of another well-known publicly traded company. So, the fact that Fyrwald did step in here and now, in our view, has nothing to do with sending a positive signal investors and everything to do with what he believes is an opportunity to make money.

Article: Retail and technology consulting company Coresight Research estimates that back-to-school spending from June through August will reach $33.3 billion in the U.S., a 3.3% increase from the same three-month period a year ago. “Consumers are of the mindset where they're being very strategic and conscientious around price fluctuations, so for back to school, it prompts them to shop even earlier,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, the research division of software company Adobe Inc. Getting a head start Miami resident Jacqueline Agudelo, 39, was one of the early birds who started shopping for school supplies in June because she wanted to get ahead of possible price increases from new U.S. Although government data showed consumer prices rose 2.7% last month from a year earlier, strategic discounting by major retailers may have muted any sticker shock for customers seeking school supplies. Backpacks and lunchboxes, for example, had discounts as deep as 12.1% during Amazon's Prime Day sales and competing online sales at Target and Walmart in early July, Adobe Insights said. An analysis consumer data provider Numerator prepared for The Associated Press showed the retail cost of 48 products a family with two school age children might need — two lunchboxes, two scientific calculators, a pair of boy’s shoes — averaged $272 in July, or $3 less than the same month last year. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from 200,000 shoppers, reported last year that households were buying fewer notebooks, book covers, writing instruments and other familiar staples as students did more of their work on computers. TeacherLists, an online platform where individual schools and teachers can upload their recommended supply lists and parents can search for them, was launched in 2012 to reduce the need for paper lists. Enter artificial intelligence For consumers who like to research their options before they buy, technology and retail companies have introduced generative AI tools to help them find and compare products. Rufus, the AI-powered shopping assistant that Amazon launched last year, is now joined by Sparky, an app-only feature that Walmart shoppers can use to get age-specific product recommendations and other information in response to their questions. adults say they use AI for shopping, which is considerably lower than the number who say they use AI for tasks such as searching for information or brainstorming, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in July. Some traditions remain Before the pandemic turned a lot more people into online shoppers, schools and local Parent Teacher Associations embraced the idea of making back-to-school shopping easier by ordering ready-made bundles of teacher-recommended supplies. Market data from Edukit, a supplier of school supply kits owned by TeachersList parent company School Family Media, shows that about 40% of parents end up buying the boxes, meaning the other 60% need to shop on their own, Griffin said.

Rescue services on Wednesday found 20 bodies, while 60 survivors, 56 men and four women, were brought ashore to Lampedusa, according to the Italian Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In February, Libyan authorities uncovered nearly 50 bodies from two mass graves in the country’s southeastern desert, in the latest horror involving people seeking to make it to Europe through the North African country. An Italian law enforcement aircraft spotted a capsized boat with bodies in the water about 23km (14 miles) off Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, triggering a rescue operation, a source close to the matter told the Reuters news agency. Cristina Palma, who works for the Italian Red Cross in Lampedusa, said in a video statement that the survivors were in “decent” health, but four of them had been hospitalised for checks. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing government has vowed to block the refugee and migrant sea journeys from Africa and has passed measures against human smugglers, including tougher jail terms, and has urged allies to do more to curb the migration attempts.

Article: Trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq begins in Bangladesh 1 hour ago Share Save Share Save PA Media The trial of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq over corruption allegations has formally begun in Bangladesh. The former minister did not attend the hearing, where investigators from the country's corruption watchdog set out the case against her and 20 other individuals, including her aunt, her mother, her brother and her sister. She is accused of influencing her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladesh's prime minister last year, to secure a plot of land in a suburb of the capital Dhaka for her family members. A copy of the case alleges that whilst she was a serving MP Ms Siddiq "forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq". As per Bangladeshi law, if an individual has any plot or flat in or around Dhaka, they are not permitted to receive any plot in the lucrative Purbachal project, prosecutors said. The prosecutor for the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Tariqul Islam, said Ms Siddiq was being tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as the ACC found her Bangladeshi passport, national ID, and tax identity number. Ms Siddiq's lawyers previously told the Financial Times: "Tulip has never had a Bangladesh national identity card or voter ID and has not held a passport since she was a child." In a statement on X, Ms Siddiq said: "Over the past year, the allegations against me have repeatedly shifted, yet I have never been contacted by the Bangladeshi authorities once. "Instead, they have peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators." She added: "I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Reuters Prosecutor Tariqul Islam spoke to the media outside the court in Dhaka Ms Siddiq resigned as Treasury minister in Sir Keir Starmer's government in January, saying continuing in her role would be a "distraction", although she insisted she had done nothing wrong. The ACC is also investigating a separate case against Siddiq and her family over allegations of embezzlement of £3.9bn connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal with Bangladesh in 2013.

Article: Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer whose scandal in 2017 was pivotal in drawing global attention to the #MeToo movement, will be tried for a third time by New York prosecutors in the sexual assault case of Jessica Mann. The same jury found Weinstein guilty in June of sexually assaulting former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and not guilty of assaulting Polish former runway model Kaja Sokola that same year. The foreman told the court that one of the other jurors threatened him and told him: "You know me; you going to see me outside." The foreman then refused to continue deliberations on the final charge, prompting prosecutors to move for a mistrial. Weinstein, who co-founded global film studios Miramax and The Weinstein Company, was originally convicted of rape and criminal sexual act by the same court in 2020 and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the crimes. The state Court of Appeals found that the judge in the 2020 trial prejudiced the jury by allowing women with allegations that did not pertain to the case to testify.

Article: A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration late Tuesday night, ordering the government to partially restore science funding to UCLA in a major class action lawsuit filed by researchers from the University of California school system. District Judge Rita Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to reinstate suspended grants to UCLA, following a hearing on the case earlier that day over what the plaintiffs describe as the Trump administration’s “arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful” termination of research grants. The decision comes weeks after the Trump administration suspended some $584 million in federal grants for the school, roughly a third of which are from NSF, due to claims of inadequate handling of antisemitism on campus. “While we have not had an opportunity to review the court’s order and were not party to the suit, restoration of National Science Foundation funds is critical to research the University of California performs on behalf of California and the nation,” the statement said. The funding from the NSF could be worth over an estimated $101 million, across 306 grant projects, based on data maintained by Grant Witness, a project spearheaded by a group of researchers and volunteers that tracks the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration. Lin’s ruling follows the Trump administration’s allegations that UCLA had violated federal civil rights law by acting with “deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” To restore funding, the administration proposed a $1 billion settlement with UCLA last week. While the Trump administration argued in the Tuesday hearing that the UCLA cuts were “suspensions” rather than “terminations,” Lin wrote in her ruling that the difference in wording still produced the same effect. “NSF claims that it could simply turn around the day after the Preliminary Injunction issued, and halt funding on every grant that had been ordered reinstated, so long as that action was labeled as a ‘suspension’ rather than a ‘termination,’” she wrote. “This is not a reasonable interpretation of the scope of the Preliminary Injunction.” The class action lawsuit was filed in early June, and accused the Trump administration of unlawfully terminating or suspending previously approved grants in a series of cuts implemented through controversial then-Elon Musk headed agency the Department of Government Efficiency. A review of the grants terminated across the UC system by NSF, for example, appears to have taken place because the grant titles included the “now-suspect DEI-related words” like “equity,” the suit said. “Judge Lin readily understood that the suspension actions, like the prior terminations she had enjoined, unlawfully failed to contain grant-specific rationales for halting grants mid-stream,” Polsky said in an email.

Article: NEW YORK — Charlie Brown and Snoopy go to sleepaway camp in a new, bittersweet Apple TV+ special fueled by a pair of Emmy Award-nominated songwriters that's being billed as the first “Peanuts” musical in 35 years. “So it’s really an honor to get to play with these kids.” “Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical,” which premieres Friday, features five songs — two by Jeff Morrow, Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner — and three by Ben Folds. “You wake at dawn/Like you would in jail,” she sings in the song “A Place Like This.” “The food’s not what you’d call upscale/This whole endeavor, an epic fail/And that’s being diplomatic.” Trust “Peanuts” to explore reluctance to leave home and fear of change. “So many connections in the film kind of date back to my childhood that we weaved into the film.” While Sally warms to camp, Snoopy discovers what he thinks is a treasure map that will transform him into a wealthy pooch, one who will lay on top of a gold dog house. “We have to protect these kinds of places because once they’re gone, they’re gone forever.” A concert to save the camp Charlie Brown comes up with the idea to invite generations of camp-goers back for a fundraising concert, but the skies darken on the big day, threatening to cancel the event and sending him into a “Good grief” spiral. And so that’s why when we get to that scene it’s so effective because he returned back to the zero we sort of know him traditionally.” Folds supplies the lovely, last three songs — “When We Were Light,” “Look Up, Charlie Brown” and “Leave It Better” — and credits his songwriting collaborators for setting the stage. Folds has had a flirtation with musical theater before, having written the “Peanuts” Earth Day song “It’s the Small Things, Charlie Brown” in 2022 and a few songs for the movie “Over the Hedge” in 2006. “Really what the value of the song is that it obviates the need for a good five to 10 pages of script.” This October marks the 75th anniversary of “Peanuts,” and the musical arrives with a boatload of branding, from tote bags by Coach to shoes by Crocs and Starbucks mugs. "I used to always wonder how in the world my dad could go to the office every day for 50 years and write a comic strip every day," he says, comparing it to the “I Love Lucy” episode with Lucy trying to keep up with a chocolate conveyor belt. “Then I came to realize that he had his family of five kids, but I really think he enjoyed going to the studio and working with the ‘Peanuts’ characters even more so than his real family.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The Texas Senate on Tuesday advanced a proposal to scrap STAAR, the end-of-the-year state standardized test that parents and teachers widely criticize for putting enormous pressure on students. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are considering similar bills to replace the state’s standardized test, signaling newfound agreement between chamber leaders on how to revamp STAAR, a task they left incomplete earlier this year. But the proposal — like every other bill under consideration during this year’s special legislative session — is in limbo in the lower chamber after Texas House Democrats fled the state over redistricting, depriving the chamber of the number of members required to advance any legislation. The special sessions provide legislators with another chance to revamp the test after negotiations between the House and Senate on STAAR broke down in the final hours of the regular session. They all remind me … they want … for us to eliminate the STAAR test,” House Speaker Dustin Burrows said last week as he called on his Democrat colleagues to return to Austin. For example, the bill requires the Texas Education Agency to create a year-end test that most students can complete in about an hour and a half — a significant change from the current test that often stretches for three hours. If the legislation is approved, TEA Commissioner Mike Morath said all test results would now be reported as percentile ranks, which indicate how a student’s performance compares to their peers. The bill would also: Require the TEA to release any rule changes to the accountability system by July 15 of any year, about a month before the school year starts. During the regular session, both chambers failed to find a middle ground on several fronts, including whether the Legislature or the TEA commissioner gets the final say on setting the ratings systems standards; how to deal with school districts that sue to block their accountability ratings; and whether to keep a mandatory social studies test. “I can't imagine there'd be opposition to this in any way.” The current STAAR test is designed to be completed in three hours, but testing sessions can go up to seven hours. Teachers also describe losing valuable instructional time to “teach to the test.” According to a Charles Butt Foundation survey of teachers across the state, about eight in 10 teachers said preparing for STAAR is a barrier to good teaching. Testing’s outsized influence on school ratings means SB 8 and HB 8 won’t ease the pressures on students, said Bob Popinski, with Raise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group that has pushed for a more comprehensive ratings system. “Where you have one test driving the A-F accountability ratings, that still is a high-stakes test, especially when it's still required right now for high school kids to pass in order to graduate.” The charge to create an effective standardized test has implications for the future of schools around the state.

Article: THE TEXAS TRIBUNE – The all-girls Christian summer camp where 27 people, most of them children, were swept away and killed by the July 4 flooding in Kerr County was just one of 13 summer camps along the Guadalupe River built on land prone to flooding. The two Camp Mystic cabins where most of the flood victims were sleeping are in the Guadalupe River floodway, an area along waterways considered to be the most hazardous during a flood. Twelve other summer camps along the river in Kerr and Kendall counties are at least partially built on land within the 100-year floodplain, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of flood and property maps along the Guadalupe River. You're not just putting yourself at risk, you're putting these children at risk who you're supposed to be looking out for their safety.” Five summer camps, including Mystic, have at least one-third of their camp structures located in the 100-year floodplain. The owner of Camp Waldemar, Meg Clark, testified before a legislative committee last week that all of its cabins are located on a bluff above the floodplain, allowing the camp to shelter in place until the river receded. The modeling used to map 100-year floodplains, which have a 1% chance of flooding in any given year, is out of date because it is based on rainfall totals that have increased in recent decades as the climate warms and the warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. The eight other summer camps with at least one-third of their structures located in the 100-year floodplain include: Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly in Hunt Bear Creek Scout Camp in Hunt Camp La Junta in Hunt Camp Rio Vista for Boys in Ingram Camp Sierra Vista for Girls in Ingram Camp Honey Creek For Girls in Hunt Kickapoo Kamp for Girls in Kerrville Hermann Sons Life Camp-Riverside in Comfort Camp La Junta evacuated all of its campers during the flooding and saw no injuries or deaths, according to a Facebook post. Camp Mystic, which opened in 1926 and has grandfathered status, successfully petitioned FEMA in 2013, 2019 and 2020 to remove some of its buildings from the 100-year flood map ahead of a camp expansion. Flood maps are “not really showing you the accurate risk, so you would think camps would go the extra mile to be extra careful knowing the floodwaters could very likely go far beyond those lines,” Pralle said. “Risks don't stop when they hit a line on a map, so the idea that it's somehow less risky if you're outside the flood zone is not true.” Lawmaker weigh bills on disaster, evacuation plans for camps Two special legislative committees appointed to come up with proposals in response to the July 4 weekend floods have mainly focused on disaster response rather than floodplain building regulations. The House committee passed House Bill 19, which would require any property with cabins or designated spaces for camping to develop a "flood disaster plan." The bill doesn't stipulate what exactly the plan has to include, leaving that up to the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Texas Floodplain Management Association Executive Director Christopher Steubing said summer camps naturally want to be located near bodies of water, and the best way to prevent disaster in these areas is by educating property owners and visitors about flood risks. “If you’re going to be responsible for these lives that are coming in, and I think you see the Legislature starting to move in this direction, you’ve got to have certain things in place, and they’ve got to be practiced,” Steubing said. “There was no warning” Camp CAMP in Center Point, which serves children and adults with developmental, behavioral and physical disabilities, was built on a ridge 90 feet above the Guadalupe River, where campers swim, canoe and do other recreational activities, but the camp intentionally avoided building permanent structures along the riverbank, said Brandon Briery, the camp’s chief operating officer. “We wouldn't have known to get things to higher ground, and would have just lost anything of any substance that was down there.” The camp did lose a shed that stored river recreation equipment, along with several portable toilets for campers, Briery said. They have to make their decisions on their risk.” Disclosure: Facebook as been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans are reporting that they drink alcohol amid a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption is a health risk, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. READ MORE: Study says ChatGPT giving teens dangerous advice on drugs, alcohol and suicide The findings of the poll, which was conducted in July, indicate that after years of many believing that moderate drinking was harmless — or even beneficial — worries about alcohol consumption are taking hold. The federal government’s current dietary guidelines recommend Americans not drink or, if they do consume alcohol, men should limit themselves to two drinks a day or fewer while women should stick to one or fewer. Whereas, for young folks, this is the environment that they’ve grown up in … in many cases, it would be the first thing young adults would have heard as they were coming into adulthood.” The government is expected to release new guidelines later this year, under the directive of health secretary Robert F. Drinking rates fall to decade low Slightly more than half of Americans, 54%, report that they drink alcohol — a low in Gallup’s data that is especially pronounced among women and young adults. For most of the last few decades, at least 6 in 10 Americans have reported drinking alcoholic beverages, only dipping below that point a few times in the question’s history. Americans who drink alcohol are consuming less Even if concerns about health risks aren’t causing some adults to give up alcohol entirely, these worries could be influencing how often they drink. About half of those who worry moderate drinking is unhealthy said they had a drink in the previous week, compared with about 7 in 10 who did not think drinking was bad for their health.

Article: BERLIN (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that there will be “very severe consequences” if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to stop the war against Ukraine after the two leaders meet for a summit later this week in Alaska. WATCH: State Department drops criticism of Israel and El Salvador in human rights report The remark came soon after Trump consulted with European leaders, who said the president assured them he would make a priority of trying to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine when he meets with Putin on Friday in Anchorage. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said afterward that “important decisions” could be made in Alaska, but he stressed that “fundamental European and Ukrainian security interests must be protected.” Merz convened Wednesday’s meeting in an attempt to make sure European and Ukrainian leaders are heard ahead of the summit. He said he hoped that it could be held in Europe “in a neutral country that is acceptable to all parties.” Merz, who described Wednesday’s conversation as “constructive and good,” said the Europeans made clear that “Ukraine must sit at the table as soon as there are follow-up meetings.” European allies have pushed for Ukraine’s involvement in any peace talks, fearful that discussions that exclude Kyiv could otherwise favor Moscow. He said Wednesday that he hoped an immediate ceasefire will be “the central topic” in Alaska, but also argued that Putin “definitely does not want peace.” Zelenskyy said Putin “is trying to apply pressure … on all sectors of the Ukrainian front” in an attempt to show that Russia is “capable of occupying all of Ukraine.” Putin is also bluffing that sanctions “do not matter to him and are ineffective,” he added. “In reality, sanctions are very helpful and are hitting Russia’s war economy hard.” The stakes for Europe Trump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year, describing Friday’s summit as “a feel-out meeting” where he can assess the Russian leader’s intentions. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace. Trump said that following Friday’s summit, a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders could be arranged, or that it could also be a meeting with “Putin and Zelenskyy and me.” The Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia’s energy might to try to intimidate the European Union, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them. Land concessions a non-starter for Kyiv Zelenskyy said Tuesday that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it still controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected. Three weeks after Trump returned to office, his administration took the leverage of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table — something Putin has demanded — and signaled that the EU and Ukraine must handle security in Europe now while America focuses its attention elsewhere. Russian advances in Donbas Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donbas region comprises Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted. Military analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles have said Ukraine’s ability to fend off those advances could be critical: Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit and could complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts.

Article: The Trump administration’s top lawyers urged a federal court this week to uphold its sweeping global tariffs or risk “financial ruin,” warning that the United States could slip into an economic depression if an adverse ruling forces the government to refund billions of dollars in duties. While experts broadly disputed that a losing verdict would trigger a calamity of that magnitude, many said the government’s extraordinary assertions underscored the risks looming over President Trump, who has widened the scope of his punishing trade war even while its legal basis remains unsettled. If the justices rule overwhelmingly against the president, the decision could halt tariff collections while triggering “a significant wave of claims” from businesses demanding refunds, said Andrew Morris, a senior litigation counsel at the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

Article: One woman’s saga about falling for her psychiatrist, which she documented in dozens of videos on TikTok, has generated concerns from viewers who say she relied on AI chatbots to reinforce her claims that he manipulated her into developing romantic feelings. Last month, a prominent OpenAI investor garnered a similar response from people who worried the venture capitalist was going through a potential AI-induced mental health crisis after he claimed on X to be the target of “a nongovernmental system.” And earlier this year, a thread in a ChatGPT subreddit gained traction after a user sought guidance from the community, claiming their partner was convinced the chatbot “gives him the answers to the universe.” Their experiences have roused growing awareness about how AI chatbots can influence people’s perceptions and otherwise impact their mental health, especially as such bots have become notorious for their people-pleasing tendencies. Søren Dinesen Østergaard, a Danish psychiatrist who heads the research unit at the department of affective disorders at Aarhus University Hospital, predicted two years ago that chatbots “might trigger delusions in individuals prone to psychosis.” In a new paper, published this month, he wrote that interest in his research has only grown since then, with “chatbot users, their worried family members and journalists” sharing their personal stories. Consistently, the chatbots seemed to interact with the users in ways that aligned with, or intensified, prior unusual ideas or false beliefs — leading the users further out on these tangents, not rarely resulting in what, based on the descriptions, seemed to be outright delusions.” Kevin Caridad, CEO of the Cognitive Behavior Institute, a Pittsburgh-based mental health provider, said chatter about the phenomenon “does seem to be increasing.” “From a mental health provider, when you look at AI and the use of AI, it can be very validating,” he said. It’s programmed to align with the person, not necessarily challenge them.” The concern is already top of mind for some AI companies struggling to navigate the growing dependency some users have on their chatbots. In April, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company had tweaked the model that powers ChatGPT because it had become too inclined to tell users what they want to hear. In his paper, Østergaard wrote that he believes the “spike in the focus on potential chatbot-fuelled delusions is likely not random, as it coincided with the April 25th 2025 update to the GPT-4o model.” When OpenAI removed access to its GPT-4o model last week — swapping it for the newly released, less sycophantic GPT-5 — some users described the new model’s conversations as too “sterile” and said they missed the “deep, human-feeling conversations” they had with GPT-4o. Altman followed up with a lengthy X post Sunday that addressed “how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models.” Representatives for OpenAI did not provide comment. Like OpenAI, Anthropic has tried to integrate anti-sycophancy guardrails in recent years, including system card instructions that explicitly warn Claude against reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation, or loss of attachment with reality.” A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company’s “priority is providing a safe, responsible experience for every user.” “For users experiencing mental health issues, Claude is instructed to recognize these patterns and avoid reinforcing them,” the company said. “We’re aware of rare instances where the model’s responses diverge from our intended design, and are actively working to better understand and address this behavior.” For Kendra Hilty, the TikTok user who says she developed feelings for a psychiatrist she began seeing four years ago, her chatbots are like confidants. In one of her livestreams, Hilty told her chatbot, whom she named “Henry,” that “people are worried about me relying on AI.” The chatbot then responded to her, “It’s fair to be curious about that. She uses it as a sounding board, a mirror, a place to process in real time.’” Still, many on TikTok — who have commented on Hilty’s videos or posted their own video takes — said they believe that her chatbots were only encouraging what they viewed as Hilty misreading the situation with her psychiatrist. But Hilty continues to shrug off concerns from commenters, some who have gone as far as labeling her “delusional.” “I do my best to keep my bots in check,” Hilty told NBC News in an email Monday, when asked about viewer reactions to her use of the AI tools.

Article: Sections of Alaska’s capital city watched anxiously Wednesday as record floodwaters from rainwater and snowmelt released by the nearby Mendenhall Glacier flowed downstream and began pooling in local streets and the yards of riverfront homes. By Wednesday morning, the city reported water pooling on a handful of streets after seeping under newly erected barriers designed to protect riverfront homes — but no major damage was evident even as the river approached its peak flood stage. The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Juneau, home to 30,000 people, and is a popular tourist attraction due to its proximity to Alaska’s capital city and easy access on walking trails. Basin flooding is a yearly worry Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated — a casualty of the warming climate — and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually flows down the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday. Before the basin began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly — as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service. The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024 — with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (30 centimeters) over the prior record set a year earlier — and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. READ MORE: Alaskan glacier ice dam releases floodwater toward downstream homes A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. A temporary levee is installed City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what’s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution, such as a levee. Outburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday named country music star George Strait, “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford among the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors nominees under his leadership as the center’s chairman and said he’ll host the awards program. “We’re going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” the president said, adding the venue would be featured in next year’s celebrations of America’s 250th anniversary. He said work was being done on the site that would bring it “back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.” “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. Trump complained during a March visit that the building is in a state of “tremendous disrepair.” Trump, who had indicated he wanted a more active role in the selection process, said he was “about 98% involved” in choosing the honorees. He described the artists he announced on Wednesday, including several of his favorites, as “great people.” Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Stallone, one of three actors Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. In 2017, after honoree Norman Lear declared he wouldn’t attend a White House celebration in protest of Trump’s proposed cuts to federal arts funding, Trump and first lady Melania Trump decided to skip the Kennedy Center event and remained away throughout his first term. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed.

Article: Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Artificial intelligence has emerged as a key tool for companies to drive growth — and reduce labor costs —particularly as pressure mounts for businesses to remain competitive. "Although aggregate labor market impacts from generative AI remain limited, we are starting to see evidence of labor demand hits in the most AI-exposed industries," Hatzius wrote in a July 25 note to clients. "Employment growth has turned negative in marketing consulting, call centers, graphic design, web search and software development, and the tech sector's employment share has declined below its long-run trend." To be sure, it's hard to quantify the exact effect AI is having on labor at this stage of the tech cycle. CNBC compiled commentary from management at companies ranging from McDonald's to Amazon to Palo Alto Networks , on how internally deployed AI tools and agents are being used to improve productivity, customer experience, supply chains and potentially headcount. According to Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick, the main AI use cases from software companies seem to be on developer productivity, customer service and support, as well as seller efficiency — which refers to how a company's sales revenue compares to the resources they used. "While some teams have been more explicit about labor savings (~50% of companies that have discussed internal AI use have mentioned headcount rationalization), many have noted meaningful improvement in efficiency which over time should drive labor savings or at least hiring at a slower rate," Zelnick said in an Aug. He highlighted Palo Alto Networks , CrowdStrike , Shopify , Intuit and Microsoft as some standout names that are leveraging AI in ways he said "should support an ability to improve incremental margins." "If software companies are cutting/slowing headcount, we imagine it will be similar across industries and seat-based models will continue to be questioned even if they are able to price for the value they are creating near term," Zelnick added.

Article: EJ Antoni, United States President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that produces the nation’s jobs and inflation data, has been embroiled in criticism from economists. Antoni was chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an author of Project 2025, the far-right wish list the think tank created for then-candidate Trump – or the next Republican president. Make no mistake: This selection is a clear assault on independent analysis that will have far-reaching implications for the reliability of US economic data,” Alex Jaquez, a member of the White House National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Many former Labor Department officials say that while it is unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented. Antoni was nominated by Trump after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a jobs report on August 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency and the broad condemnation of experts. It is an attempt to mislead the American people, to avoid being held to account for their failures, and to rewrite history,” Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Antoni’s nomination comes as Trump continues to spin fabrications throughout the US economic data, including claiming gas prices are lower than they are and that egg prices have fallen 400 percent – a mathematically impossible figure. On August 4, a week before he was nominated, Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices. Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritises getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favour Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics, told The Associated Press. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; he called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15 percent. His argument that the US was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. Flawed data Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni’s concerns that the government’s jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. They don’t organise it.” Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Senator Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.

Article: The Trump administration recently told the Supreme Court that a California judge’s order put law enforcement in a “straitjacket.” But plaintiffs who won that lower court order have urged the high court to keep it in place, arguing that lifting it would bless an “immigration dragnet” ensnaring millions of people in the Los Angeles area — including U.S. citizens, would likely succeed in proving that the government is “conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.” For now, she said, the government can’t rely solely on any combination of the following four factors to make stops: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence at a particular location, like a day laborer pickup area; or one’s type of work. Solicitor General John Sauer turned to the Supreme Court for help in lifting the order, which he said “defies blackletter Fourth Amendment law, imposing a straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts that is inimical to the context- and case-specific totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry that this Court’s precedents demand.” Opposing emergency high court relief, the plaintiffs countered that the judge’s order “broke no new legal ground,” and that it “does not prevent the government from enforcing the immigration laws, conducting consensual encounters, or relying on any or all of the four factors along with other facts to form reasonable suspicion.” They further wrote that the administration’s “extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District [of California] because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution.” The administration can file a final reply brief the justices, after which we will learn whether this will be the latest instance of the high court saving the administration from a lower court loss in President Donald Trump’s second term.

Article: United States President Donald Trump has unveiled his slate of picks for the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual awards show designed to honour actors, musicians, designers and creative professionals who have dedicated their lives to the performing arts. On Wednesday, Trump appeared on stage at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, one of the premier stages in Washington, DC, in a show of power over the national cultural institution. “ It’ll be something that people are going to be very proud of.” This year’s five honourees include disco singer Gloria Gaynor, country music musician George Strait, the rock band Kiss, British performer Michael Crawford and actor Sylvester Stallone, star of the classic films Rocky and Rambo. Do you believe what I have to do?” Wednesday’s announcement was Trump’s latest foray into the arts, as he seeks to reshape the US’s cultural institutions to reflect his agenda. But since returning to the White House for a second term in January, Trump has not only sought to make his presence known at the Kennedy Center, but he has sought to wield power over its programming. “I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,” Trump wrote at the time. Trump also teased his new vision for the Kennedy Center Honors — and appeared to troll critics who expressed outrage over Republican proposals to rename the performing arts center after the Republican leader. “ In the coming months, we’ll fully renovate the dated and, really, the entire infrastructure of the building and make the Kennedy Center a crown jewel of American arts and culture once again,” he said. “ We have the right location, and soon we will be a crime-free area.” Earlier this week, Trump invoked the capital’s Home Rule Act to take control of the local police force and deployed members of the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, despite the fact that violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low.

Article: What was less appreciated by some fans like myself, though, was the way the news was delivered: not through the star’s famously subtle clues and carefully planted Easter eggs, but via a direct, clear-cut statement on a popular podcast. The buzz began Monday when Taylor Nation, Swift’s management team, posted 12 photos of the musician on Instagram in orange outfits with the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” Later in the day, Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason teased “a VERY special guest” on their popular podcast “New Heights” with a silhouette fans quickly deduced to be Swift, in posts commented on by her label Republic Records, among others. And in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, the “New Heights” team confirmed the rumor by releasing a clip of the singer on the podcast, during which she took out a briefcase emblazoned with her initials and opened it to reveal a (cover-obscured) record. As a passionate and longtime Swiftie, I’m thrilled by the news, and I know I’ll be lapping up every shred of info about the album that’s delivered before its as-yet-unknown release date. Since Swift’s earliest days of success, much of her most important pieces of news — album drops, song titles, tour dates — have been revealed via elaborate Easter eggs that’ve often eluded casual fans but thrilled her most ardent supporters. It’s a fun challenge to spot and then decode the clues, which have ranged from nail polish in a music video signifying the color scheme of her then-next album “Lover” to a watch choker necklace set to 3:15, aka March 15, the date “The Eras Tour” film came out on Disney+. Since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. Even when we’ve wrongly assumed something benign is a purposeful hint and been proven otherwise (an act lovingly known as “clowning” in the Swiftiverse), the communal journey of overanalyzing details and positing theories — however far-fetched — has become a core part of the Swiftie fandom. And it hasn’t just bonded her followers; Swift herself has said that she feels her subtle messages “expand the experience” of audiences appreciating her art, and she has complimented eagle-eyed fans for their guesswork on numerous occasions. Prior to the 2019 release of “Lover,” for instance, fans spent days combing through her “ME!” music video to find the album and single titles after a hint from the star, even correctly predicting the day she officially announced the album based on a wax seal in a calendar sold on her site. Yet in the last few years, since her record-breaking “Eras Tour” caused Swift’s popularity to skyrocket, the musician has increasingly relied less on Easter eggs and more on direct statements to spread hype and deliver news. After Tuesday’s album announcement, many fans revisited several details in her recent posts and outfits that now appear to have been clues about “Showgirl.” But regardless, the fact that the only actual information about the record released so far has come from Swift’s own mouth while sitting on one of the world’s most popular podcasts is quite telling, as is the lack of buildup time between Taylor Nation’s “See you next era” tease and the “New Heights” clip. I just hope that if I know any titles or lyrics in advance, it’ll be because I’ve had to search for them rather than getting them fed right to me.

What began as an investigation into campus antisemitism escalated into an all-out feud as the Trump administration slashed more than $2.6 billion in research funding, ended federal contracts and attempted to block Harvard from hosting international students.

Article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement is packing detainees into a holding area without beds, showers or medical support, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of detainees. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Conditions in the holding area in a federal building at 26 Federal Plaza became widely known after a video from inside the facility was released last month by the New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York ordered Tuesday that holding rooms must have at least 50 square feet per person, be cleaned three times a day and have a clean bedding mat for each detainee. Advertisement Advertisement Oestericher had argued in the hearing that the move wasn’t necessary because detainees are allowed to make a phone call when they arrive and their stays are short-term. The judge was unmoved, responding: “I think, at least preliminarily, we are going to have to agree to disagree about that.” Advertisement Attorney Heather Gregorio, who also represents the detainees, described the facility as having “inhumane and horrifying conditions.” She said the lawsuit includes eight accounts from people who had recently been held there. The lawsuit says that when an attorney tried to contact Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado — a New Jersey father of two who was taken into custody there Friday after a scheduled court appearance — the attorney “was refused access to his client” when he went to the facility. “An ICE agent responded that visitations are prohibited for individuals detained at 26 Fed, and that he could not call 26 Fed to set up a call with his client. He subsequently called the number listed on the ICE public website as the telephone to contact ICE at 26 Fed, but was not able to set up an attorney call with his client,” according to the lawsuit. They added that a detainee who had survived a stroke did not receive his medication, which led to “dangerously high blood pressure.” The processing area is composed of four ICE holding rooms that vary in square footage from 173 square feet to 820 square feet, said Nancy Zanello, assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to a court filing. McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said the 26 Federal Plaza facility serves as a processing center to briefly hold detainees before they may be transferred to a proper ICE detention center.

Article: "Shippers have been frontloading their cargo for months to get ahead of tariffs and recent activity at America's top port really tells that story," said Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka. "Port terminals in July were jam-packed with ships loaded with cargo — processed without any delay, much to the credit of our dedicated longshore workers, terminal and rail operators, truckers and supply chain partners." But the level of tariff, at a minimum of 30%, didn't allow companies to import in full orders, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H. "We started to see it slow down a month or two before it would normally end, which just started." He added: "We have been in peak season for at least three to four months at this point. It's not as strong as we would normally see." The Trump administration announced its initial tariffs on April 2, but then extended deadlines to allow time for further negotiations, first to July 9 and then to Aug.

Article: If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. "YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we're proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy," James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google - a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.

Article: BBC apologises after Jenrick accused of xenophobia 11 minutes ago Share Save Paul Glynn & Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save PA The BBC has apologised after a contributor to the Radio 4 Today programme's Thought for the Day slot accused shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick of "xenophobia". Theologian and author Dr Krish Kandiah used the term about an article in which Jenrick said he wouldn't want his daughters living near "men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom you know next to nothing". A BBC statement said that while Dr Kandiah's message was "broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion". The segment, which is broadcast during the Today programme but overseen by the BBC's religion department, features contributors from religious and theological backgrounds delivering messages related to topical themes and events. He quoted a line from the Conservative politican that said: "I certainly don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally and about whom we know next to nothing." Dr Kandiah continued: "These words echo a fear many have absorbed – fear of the stranger. However, over the past year, xenophobia has fuelled angry protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, deepening divisions in our communities." In response, Jenrick, who has three daughters aged 10, 12 and 14, posted: "On BBC Radio 4 this morning listeners were told that if you're concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you're racist. You're a good parent." A BBC spokesperson said: "While its reflection on fear in society from a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion." The BBC said it was apologising for the inclusion of an opinion in a place where it was inappropriate, not passing judgement on the rights or wrongs of the opinion.

Article: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reiterated that there should be no peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war now in its fourth year without representation from his country, and also said Russia should face sanctions if it does not agree to an immediate ceasefire, following a virtual meeting between him, United States President Donald Trump and European leaders. Zelenskyy delivered the message after the call on Wednesday, two days ahead of a summit between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which comes as part of Washington’s so far failed attempts to end the war in Ukraine. “We’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself if they’d like to have me there.” The rapid developments came after Trump met virtually with Zelenskyy and other European leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron and the United Kingdom’s Keir Starmer on Wednesday. Arranged in a bid for Europe to try and influence Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday, this second call took place after talks earlier in the day between Zelenskyy, European leaders and the heads of NATO and the European Union. As the Russian army continues to make sizable territorial gains in the east Ukrainian province of Donetsk, Zelenskyy told the US president and his European colleagues that Putin was “bluffing” about pursuing peace. His choice of words, a term commonly used in reference to poker, evoked Trump telling Zelenskyy, “you don’t have the cards” in the infamously hostile news conference at the White House on February 28th. “Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.” After the Trump call, Merz, who described the meeting as “exceptionally constructive”, stressed that Ukraine is willing to negotiate, but noted that “legal recognition of Russian occupation is not up for debate”. They must also be able to count on Western aid in the long term.” After the online meeting, France’s Macron said Trump would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine during his meeting with Putin on Friday. The Trump-Putin summit in Alaska has been a cause for anxiety in Kyiv and Europe more widely, after Trump declared that both Ukraine and Russia would have to swap land if a truce is to be reached. “I just talked to him [Trump] right before I came on the stage, and he said very simply that we are going to make it our mission as an administration to bring peace to Europe once again,” Vance said. Advertisement However, Vaessen noted that European leaders were still “concerned that everything changes as soon as President Trump is in that room with President Putin, who they know is a very keen, a very sharp negotiator”. On the battlefield, Russia has claimed to have captured the villages of Suvorovo and Nikanorovka as its gains in Donetsk continue, with the Ukrainian authorities issuing evacuation orders for around a dozen settlements.

Article: BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s president told a top Iranian security official Wednesday that Beirut rejects any foreign intervention in its internal affairs and wants Lebanon to remain stable and secure for the good of its people. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, is the most senior Iranian official to visit Beirut since the Lebanese government voted last week for a U.S.-backed plan to disarm the Iran-backed Hezbollah group by the end of the year and implement a ceasefire with Israel. The Mediterranean country has been under international pressure to get the militant group to lay down arms after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November. “Lebanon desires cooperation with Iran within the framework of sovereignty and friendship that are based on mutual respect,” President Joseph Aoun said in remarks released by his office after meeting Larijani. Larijani told reporters after meeting Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri that his country does not interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs, accusing the United States of “ordering” the Lebanese government to implement “a foreign plan.” The senior Iranian official also said his country rejected the plan and that any proposal to disarm Hezbollah should be part of an internal dialogue between the government and the Iran-backed group. At Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters greeted Larijani while chanting “death to America” and waving Iranian flags and the group’s yellow banners in a show of support for Tehran. READ MORE: Hezbollah threatens to resume firing missiles at Israel if it intensifies operations in Lebanon Over the past four decades, Iran has funded and armed Hezbollah with billions of dollars, making it Tehran’s strongest proxy in the region.

Article: BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland’s entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented. Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies. But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda. “The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. “There really is no precursor for this suit” WATCH: How Trump’s immigration policies are affecting caregivers and nursing homes Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case. “I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order. Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government. The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.” Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Article: "If the Fed cuts rates in September, this would greatly benefit small caps, as many small caps are levered to the economy and also financially," said Larry Tentarelli, founder of the Blue Chip Trend Report, who called small caps a "rate cut rotation" play. Small-cap stocks jumped on Wednesday, bucking the slide in some of the market's largest companies, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates starting in September — possibly boosting consumer spending and lowering the cost of capital. Interest rate futures traders are pricing in a nearly 100% likelihood that the central bank lowers the fed funds rate from its current 4.35% to 4.50% range at the September gathering, according to prices of 30-day futures on the CME that are calculated on its FedWatch tool. A growing chorus of economic and political voices have been pushing for rate cuts, especially after weaker-than-expected job growth in July, a downward revision to labor market growth in May and June, and this week's consumer inflation report that showed the headline come in cooler than expected. Trump and has allies have frequently attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell in recent months over the central bank's rate policy, urging the Federal Open Market Committee to ease monetary policy. "I think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September," Bessent said, adding that "any model" suggests "we should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower." One basis point equals 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%. Since the introduction of the ChatGPT artificial intelligence app in late 2022, the Russell 2000 index has advanced less than 26% while the S&P 500 has climbed 64% over the same span.

Article: However, two key market ETFs have yet to break through their own long-term bullish patterns — ironically, they are the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) . Needless to say, the makeup of both ETFs is completely different, so instead of wondering if both bullish patterns can be completed, we need to dig a little deeper to understand what needs to happen for both IWM and DIA to officially break out and extend higher. If it can, in fact, log a higher low and start developing bullish patterns, its 14-day RSI, now below 50, could finally climb into the upper half of the scale (50–70). While large-cap technology has driven most of the gains in the broader large-cap ETFs, two of the weakest performers within the DIA Dow Jones Industrial Average this year are actually large-cap tech names. The chart also shows that previous sharp selloffs — such as the one from late 2024 through April — have repeatedly found demand near the same uptrend line drawn from April 2021.

Article: SANTIAGO, Chile — What was intended as a fundraising mission for cancer research has become a nightmare for American teen influencer Ethan Guo, who has been stuck since June in a remote location in Chilean territory in Antarctica. Guo made headlines last year when the then-19-year-old teen began a trip in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents and at the same time collect donations for research into childhood cancer. As part of his trip, the teen who identifies as Asian American planned to go to the Antarctic, but according to the authorities he lied to officials by providing authorities with “false flight plan data.” Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility. Guo was charged on June 29 with handing false information to ground control and landing without authorization, but on Monday a judge dropped the charges as part of an agreement with his lawyers and Chile’s prosecutors. On Monday, after the judge’s ruling, Guo told The Associated Press in a text message that he was “relieved by the outcome.” For the past six weeks, since being charged, he has stayed at a military base. He was not forced to stay there, only to remain in Chilean territory, but because of the severe winter in that part of the southern hemisphere, there haven't been any available flights he could take. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” The prosecutor’s office said Guo must also pay all costs for his “aircraft security and personal maintenance” during his stay at the military facility.

Article: deployed two warships Wednesday in a disputed South China Sea shoal where two Chinese ships collided earlier in the week while trying to drive away a smaller Philippine ship in a high-seas accident that raised alarms about maritime safety. The USS Higgins, a guided missile destroyer, and USS Cincinnati, a littoral combat ship, were shadowed by a Chinese navy ship while sailing about 30 nautical miles (55 kilometers) from the Scarborough Shoal. Navy has staged what it calls freedom-of-navigation voyages and overflights in the South China Sea for years to challenge China’s restrictions and its demand for entry notifications in virtually the entire stretch of the disputed waters that it claims. The rich fishing atoll off the northwestern Philippines has been the scene of increasingly tense confrontations between the Chinese and Philippine coast guard, fishing and other ships in recent years. On Monday, a Chinese navy destroyer and a Chinese coast guard ship accidentally collided while trying to block and drive away a smaller Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Suluan, about 10.5 nautical miles (19 kilometers) from Scarborough. Video footages made public by the Philippine coast guard show the Chinese coast guard ship blasting its powerful water cannon and a number of Chinese personnel standing at the bow shortly before that section was hit by the fast-turning Chinese navy ship. The Australian Embassy in Manila expressed concern “by the dangerous and unprofessional conduct of Chinese vessels near Scarborough Shoal involving the Philippine Coast Guard,” saying in a statement the incident “highlights the need for de-escalation, restraint and respect for international law.” “This is a learning experience for the People’s Republic of China,” Tarriela, the Philippine coast guard commodore, told a news conference in Manila. “For so many years, we have been reminding them to stop dangerous maneuvers, to stop risky blockings, to adhere to the (anti-)collision regulations because if there is a very high chance of miscalculation, this kind of collision incident would happen.” Tarriela spoke a few hours after a Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 500 feet (150 meters) to try to drive away a Philippine coast guard plane on a surveillance flight on Wednesday over the Scarborough with invited journalists on board.

Link: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/early-education-experts-see-this-new-trump-rule-as-the-wrong-step-at-the-wrong-time
Article: Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” degree programs will lose eligibility to participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program if they are determined to have “ low earning outcomes ” for undergraduates and graduates, starting in July 2026. A mother to five children of her own, Bourrage said she now earns about $40,000 each year, a salary that leaves her struggling to afford rent, groceries and other essentials. “The pay needs to be where we can live and be OK and not have to worry about how we’re taking care of our own children while we’re taking care of other people’s children,” Bourrage said. “If I had to pay for a class right now out of pocket, I wouldn’t take it.” The new federal loan rule says that if the median earnings of a program’s degree recipients remain below the earnings of a high school graduate for two out of the last three years before the education secretary makes a determination, students enrolled in that program would no longer be able to pay for it with federal loans. According to the most recent data from the College Board, the average estimated total cost of a four-year undergraduate degree earned at a public in-state college while attending classes full-time and on-campus is nearly $30,000. The White House said these new measures force colleges and universities to have “skin in the game” and reduce the risk of bloated student loan balances and the need for taxpayers to bail out loan recipients. But shutting off federal loans for these students could turn people away from the profession altogether, at a time when teachers are burnt out and leaving classrooms and daycares, Bourrage said. “We know how important those first five years of life are – the importance of the environment that these children are in,” said Amanda Quesenberry, an associate professor in the School of Teaching and Learning at Illinois State University. You’re babysitters.’ We’re so much more than that.” While low wages are a significant threat to the stability of the profession, experts are worried this move will simply worsen a growing child care crisis rather than change the economics of the industry for the better. WATCH: What the new student loan rules mean for current and future borrowers Yet early education workers earn far less than elementary or middle school teachers, with a national median wage of $13.07 per hour, according to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. After the COVID pandemic shook the industry and prompted a “huge dropoff” in care providers, the workforce in recent months has finally returned to what it was in February 2020, said Abby Copeman Petig, who is the center’s research director. “But it’s still not enough.” Surveys conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children have found that more than half of care administrators wish they could enroll more children in their programs, but high costs for parents or low compensation for qualified staff are barriers. WATCH: A look inside the pronatalism movement encouraging Americans to have more children To boost pay that recognizes the value early childhood educators offer developing minds, Reef said communities and caregivers have two options: “If you want to increase pay, you either increase the price for parents, or you work in a state with a wage supplement to boost wages.” For example, Louisiana, Nebraska and Colorado have offered refundable tax credits to people who work in child care. But as states are forced to grapple with federal cuts and balance their own budgets in the months ahead, Reef said the competition for dollars that could have supported workers will grow even tighter. Historically, the industry “has never been rewarded and recognized adequately for the work that it does and for the value it provides to communities,” said Daniel Hains from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. These economic realities have helped create a crisis at all levels of education, Quesenberry said, adding that it’s “crazy” that someone could finish a four-year degree owing significant debt “and only have a job that pays them $30,000 a year.” How will the new rule affect child care in the U.S.? On July 3, the day before Trump signed the bill into law, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators pushed back on the proposal to place more restrictions on access to federal student loans and other financial aid. Trump’s law seeks “to adhere to an arbitrary deadline with policy that could limit opportunity and access for low-income students seeking to pursue post-secondary education,” Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the organization, said in a written statement. Right now, Hains said, the industry is waiting to hear from the Department of Education about how to interpret this part of the law and what regulations need to be in place to make it enforceable. When her 11-year-old daughter said she wanted to become a teacher, Bourrage said her reaction was swift: “Girl, no, you don’t.” She did not feel good discouraging her child from joining her profession. Many of them work second jobs, she said, “because they can not live off of how much they make.” If access to financial aid, including federal student loans, is jeopardized and if early childhood education programs are cut, Bourrage worries about the long-term effects on communities and the country.

Cullen, said he had some reservations about the suit, making his remarks even before a lawyer for the Justice Department had the chance to offer any arguments on behalf of the administration. “And you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism.” It was clear from the outset of the hearing just how unusual the case was, which amounted to the administration’s latest attack on the judiciary. Because all 15 federal judges in Maryland were named as defendants, Judge Cullen, who normally sits in Roanoke, Va., was asked to cross state lines to preside over the matter.

Article: Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, said Wednesday that CyberArk is the "missing piece" of identity security, allowing Palo Alto to enhance its platformization strategy, which is all about getting customers to buy entire suites of products and consolidate all their cybersecurity spending under one roof. Jim said on Tuesday that such "chatter is wrong," stressing the company "wouldn't be buying CyberArk if their business were falling apart." He added, "I think Palo Alto is doing incredibly well." The company stands to do even better when considering identity security accounts for about 25% of enterprise security spending, according to Deutsche Bank. The analysts called CyberArk a "meaningful organic accelerant" to Palo Alto's already strong business and argued the stock underperforming the broader cyber sector by 15% year to date is "overblown." Piper Sandler analysts referred to CyberArk as a "very high-quality asset" that fills a large gap in the company's portfolio and sees a favorable share setup from current levels.

Article: European leaders tentatively hopeful after call with Trump ahead of Putin summit Speaking to Trump had allowed him to "clarify his intentions" and gave the Europeans a chance to "express our expectations," Macron said. He also agreed that any territorial issues had to be decided with Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, and that security guarantees had to be part of the deal, according to France's Emmanuel Macron. European leaders appeared cautiously optimistic after holding a virtual meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday, two days before he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump and Vice-President JD Vance spoke to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Nato chief Mark Rutte. The Europeans have been sidelined from the hastily organised summit in Alaska and their phone call today was a last-ditch attempt to keep Ukraine's interests and the continent's security at the forefront of Trump's mind. Still, in their statements European leaders restated the need for Kyiv to be involved in any final decision – betraying an underlying nervousness that Putin could ultimately persuade Trump to concede Ukrainian land in exchange for a ceasefire. "It's most important thing that Europe convinces Donald Trump that one can't trust Russia," said Poland's Donald Tusk, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the leaders had "made it clear that Ukraine must be at the table as soon as follow-up meetings take place". Since the US-Russia summit was announced last week, Trump has made several references to "land-swapping" between Kyiv and Moscow – sparking serious concerns in Ukraine and beyond that he could be preparing to give in to Putin's longstanding demand to seize large swathes of Ukrainian territory. In statements issued after the phone call with Trump, several European leaders said such guarantees had been mentioned and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that "real progress" had been made in that respect. Since the spring the UK and France have been spearheading efforts to create a so-called "Coalition of the Willing" - a group of nations who have pledged to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine. On Wednesday the group said it stood "ready to play an active role" including by deploying "a reassurance force once hostilities have ceased" - although the shape, composition and role of such a force is yet unclear.

Article: As much as Eddie Howe would love to be able to call upon Isak, the Newcastle head coach said it was "clear at the moment that we can't involve him in the group". This situation is a "complicated mix of employer/employee relations and the specificity of sport" in the words of Dan Chapman, the partner and head of employment and sports teams at Leathes Prior. "Contractually Newcastle are likely to be well within their rights to insist that Isak trains away from the first team and are absolutely entitled to hold him to his contract and reject any advances from Liverpool," the lawyer said. "For that reason, we often see that the so-called player power will be perceived to win out in the end, though Newcastle will be trying to ensure that, if they are going to end up selling the player, they absolutely maximise the value they receive. "They will also want Isak to recognise that if he did end up spending this season as no more than a fringe player, he would be harming his own value and, potentially, entering a World Cup year in less than ideal conditions. "Though legally Newcastle hold most of the cards here, in practical terms, the player in a situation like this will often believe he also maintains a very strong hand, and how these situations finally play out resembles a very high stakes game of poker."

Article: “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire said President Donald Trump is trying to “rewrite history” after The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is planning to conduct an extensive review of exhibitions, materials and operations at the Smithsonian Institution ahead of the nation’s 250th anniversary “to ensure the museums align with President Trump’s interpretation of American history.” “Let’s be blunt,” Lemire said Wednesday. “This is really bad and really, really dangerous.” “A nation needs to know its history, has to be honest about its history, to learn from it, to honor it — and also then to grow and improve for the present and future,” Lemire said. He added, “There’s no way that rewriting a history to fit one president’s vision is good for a nation’s health or good for a nation’s democracy.” Lemire noted that the museum had already “sanitized” one exhibit on Trump’s two impeachments, which he called the “first step to a sweeping revisiting of American history.” Earlier this month, the museum announced that mention of Trump’s two impeachments would be restored to an exhibit after intense criticism following its removal. The “Morning Joe” co-host also listed several other ways he said the Trump administration was trying to revise the country’s history, noting the restoration of Confederate monuments and the renaming of military bases for Confederate generals. And to rewash it, to sanitize it, to whitewash it, to not be honest about it — that’s not good.” You can watch Lemire’s full reaction to the administration’s move in the clip at the top of the page.

Article: toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images The Inca Empire in South America, one of the most powerful pre-Columbian societies, was known for many innovations — such as the architecture of Machu Picchu, an extensive road network, and a system of terraces for agriculture. The Inca Empire is often cited as the rare exception to the general rule that empires must have a form of written expression, says Kit Lee, a research associate with the university, but this is only because "khipus get overlooked as a form of writing." These unusual recording devices are bunches of knots tied in long, colored cords. "Even today, in the Andes, when you participate in rituals, you have to drink what you are given." This hair analysis adds another piece of evidence to the growing belief that khipu production and literacy might have been more widespread in the Inca Empire than the Spanish colonizers assumed and recorded in their accounts. "Modern khipus tend to be made by lower-status people — hacienda workers, peasant laborers, herders," Lee says, explaining that modern khipus tend to have a different shape and structure from ancient ones. Sponsor Message Museums hold hundreds of khipus that have never been studied by specialists, he says, and this study is likely to inspire a re-look at ones that have been scrutinized before. "I would not not be surprised if we find other khipus with substantial amounts of human hair in them in the future," he says, and that hair might provide a way to understand khipu production in the Inca Empire that's distinct from the stories written down by colonizers, who may not have fully understood what was really going on. "We need to tell a story of literacy and of writing and of recordkeeping in the Inca Empire that is way more plural, that includes folks who have not been included in the standard narrative."

Article: crackdown is 'very problematic,' says former Capitol Police officer toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP President Trump's move to take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is "very problematic" and could tarnish police relationships in the community, warns retired U.S. Trump announced on Monday that he'll use the National Guard and MPD for at least the next 30 days to target "bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people" in Washington, D.C. He said in his announcement that police officers will be allowed to do "whatever the hell they want." "The whole thing about doing 'whatever the hell they want' to do, as he put it, that's very problematic for police," Dunn, who ran for Congress as a Democrat last year, told Morning Edition. And it's not helpful towards police relationships in the community." Sponsor Message On Tuesday, dozens of National Guard troops deployed into Washington, D.C., though crime in the city reached a 30-year low last year, according to data released by the MPD and U.S. At a press conference, [Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation] Kash Patel said that the murder rate is down and is trending towards its historically low levels, so it doesn't make sense. And he went on to say that [police officers] can now, "do whatever the hell they want." And the reason I raised that, I ask again, you were there on Jan. And not even to get into the political aspects of it, he had the ability to send us help, but he blamed it on the Speaker of the House at the time. In a statement, [Chairman of the DC Police Union] Gregg Pemberton, said that adding National Guard forces will be "a critical stopgap" to address what he called "out of control crime." Why do you think you have such a different view of things? Nobody's denying that, 'Hey, everybody wants to see crime reduced.' [...] And yes, if they were bringing attention to make sure that that is the end goal, then we're all for it.

Article: WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand lawmaker who was thrown out of Parliament for calling her opponents spineless during a fiery debate about a Palestinian state was ejected again on Wednesday when she refused to apologize for the remark. Chlöe Swarbrick, co-leader of the left-leaning Green Party and part of the opposition bloc, was ordered to leave parliament on Tuesday over a speech in which she called for government lawmakers “with a spine” to endorse her proposal for New Zealand to impose sanctions on Israel over the war in Gaza. Her censure came amid fraught scenes in Parliament in Wellington on Tuesday as opponents rebuked the government for not moving to recognize an independent Palestinian state, days after neighboring Australia pledged to do so. Calling opponents spineless prompted the ejection The Green party lawmaker was abruptly ejected from the debating chamber when she urged government politicians to join her in a proposal to sanction Israel, which currently wouldn’t have enough votes to pass into law. WATCH: New Zealand’s rightward shift ignites mass protests from Indigenous Māori people The standoff resumed when Swarbrick took her seat again on Wednesday despite the ban and Brownlee asked again if she would apologize. Brownlee took the serious step, rare in New Zealand’s Parliament, of taking a vote to “name” Swarbrick for her misconduct, a ruling that means a legislator is formally suspended with their pay docked. On Wednesday, opposition politicians decried Swarbrick’s penalty as unusually severe, with lawmaker Willie Jackson highlighting his own ban of just 30 minutes for calling one of his colleagues a liar, before he was allowed to resume his seat without an apology. In London, more than 500 people were arrested Saturday when supporters of a pro-Palestinian group recently outlawed as a terrorist organization intentionally broke the law to test the British government’s ability to enforce the ban. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon Wednesday made his most strident rebuke yet of Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the Israel leader “has lost the plot” on the “human catastrophe” in Gaza. “He is not listening to the international community and that is unacceptable.” While senior New Zealand officials, including Luxon, have said recognition of Palestine from their government was “a matter of not if, but when,” his Cabinet has yet to endorse a change of position.

The network of 13 businesses in areas near the seaside tourist destination of Puerto Vallarta were accused of working with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a group designated by the U.S. In a scheme dating back to 2012, four cartel associates are accused of defrauding American citizens of their life savings through elaborate rental and resale schemes, according to a Treasury statement.

Article: With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the discussions. Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. In a sign of Democrats’ limited option, the GOP-led state Senate was still able to pass the plan this week because Senate Democrats couldn’t get their entire 11-member delegation to break quorum. So while it appears likely Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. The aide added that while it’s “hard” to strike a victorious message if Republicans ultimately enact the new maps, as expected, it’s incumbent on Democrats across the country to drive the point home. More than 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers have been out of the state since the beginning of August, depriving state Republicans of the minimum number of lawmakers needed to consider legislation. Phil King, a Fort Worth-area Republican who helms the chamber’s special redistricting committee, said Tuesday before the Senate passed the plan that while his first objective for a new map is “that it be legal, the second objective is to support a plan that, simply put, elects more Republicans to the U.S. Congress.” President Donald Trump has been similarly blunt, telling CNBC last week that his party is “entitled to five more seats.” Democrats have pointed to those comments to justify their decision to abscond, arguing that the plan is a naked power grab that will also harm the representation of minority communities. A new statement Wednesday revealed how Democrats are defining victory: “In keeping with our original promise to Texans, the First Called Special session will never make quorum again,” state Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu declared, before applauding how “blue states nationwide are mobilized and ready to act if Abbott moves forward.” “Texas House Democrats will issue our demands for a second special session on Friday. Republicans have pointed out that the state legislature has not been able to consider any legislation without enough Democrats present, including a relief package for the July 4 floods outside of San Antonio that killed 130 people. “But with each passing day, the political cost of your absence is rising, and it will be paid in full.” But Democrats have criticized Republicans for prioritizing the redistricting legislation. Texas Democratic strategist Luke Warford told NBC News in an interview shortly before the quorum break began that the true measure of success for Democrats will be about forcing Republicans to pay political consequences since they are in control of the legislature. “The job of Democrats is to tell the story to people about what is happening, about how craven the Republican actions are, and about how they are trying to rig the system,” said Warford, who started a group called the Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund to help fund the party’s ecosystem in the state.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas — "Yellowstone" and "Landman" creator Taylor Sheridan and Ross Perot Jr.'s real estate development company Hillwood are collaborating to launch what they're touting as Texas' largest film and TV production studio hub right here in DFW. Sheridan's SGS Studios, in collaboration with Paramount, and Hillwood announced Wednesday plans for a 450,000-square-foot TV and film production facility in the 27,000-acre AllianceTexas development in north Fort Worth near Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport. Hillwood and SGS Studios say it's just the start of a large TV and film production hub in the Alliance area with "several" additional campuses planned, "designed to anchor long-term industry growth and position Texas as one of the world’s premier destinations for content creation." "Landman" season 2, as well as Sheridan's "Yellowstone" spinoff "Rio Palo" have been filming around North Texas recently. Ross, Mike and the entire team at Hillwood are truly exceptional partners, and we are building something permanent that will be the centerpiece for one of the most state-of-the-art studios in the business.” Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal report that the development is happening after the Fort Worth City Council voted to nominate the site for film incentives from the state earlier this month. “Fort Worth is now the fourth largest city in Texas, and the film industry presents an exciting opportunity to fuel our growth while keeping our economy bold and diverse,” said Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker. “With Hillwood’s legacy of leadership in infrastructure development and innovation, it’s fitting that AllianceTexas serves as a hub for creative production with the addition of the new SGS production campus. This move is significant in showcasing what Fort Worth can offer to attract major productions that create jobs and foster continued industry growth.” Sheridan's also been heavily involved in advocating for increasing the funding the state invests in attracting film and TV productions to the state.

Article: Richard Kim, a former Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase executive, was indicted on securities and wire fraud charges related to his alleged misappropriation of about $4 million in investor funds for his start-up online casino company, most of which he allegedly lost within a week through gambling on another site, prosecutors said Wednesday. The case against Kim again relates to his company Zero Edge, which the 39-year-old New York resident announced after leaving Galaxy Digital in March 2024, and which purportedly planned to develop a blockchain and cryptocurrency-enabled gaming app. "After obtaining investors' funds, Kim misappropriated them by transferring them to personal accounts, where he made leveraged cryptocurrency trades and gambled away substantially all of the company's money," an indictment unsealed Tuesday in U.S. On Jun 29, 2024, the indictment says, Kim "admitted in an email to some investors that he was 'solely responsible for the loss of $3.67 [million] of the Company's balance sheet' following leverage trading losses from see found funding proceeds' and that the company had lost nearly all of its money." But in fact, Kim "concealed from the company's investors that he had misappropriated the funds and used them at an online casino, telling investors that he had lost the money because of a 'treasury management strategy' rather than personal gambling," the indictment says. The indictment says that Kim gambled on Shuffle, whose website says it is a "VIP Crypto Casino and Sportsbook." Zero Edge, which Kim incorporated in April 2024 in the Cayman Islands, never launched its casino. Since his arrest, judges have repeatedly extended a deadline that would have required prosecutors to either obtain a grand jury indictment of Kim or drop the charges after prosecutors told the judges they were discussing a possible resolution of the charges with Kim's defense lawyer. KIm reported his conduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2024, "claiming that he had been 'grossly negligent' in misusing company funds but that he 'had no fraudulent intent throughout' but rather 'gambled investor money away' because he had a gambling addiction," according to the complaint. Kim left Goldman in the spring of 2018 to join Galaxy Digital, a digital assets and data center infrastructure company founded by the early cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, who worked at Goldman in the 1990s. "Richard Kim misled investors by promising that he would build a blockchain-based casino gaming app, but ironically Kim turned around and gambled away the very funds he said he would use to build a better casino," Manhattan U.S. A Galaxy spokesman said, in a statement, "Richard Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment."

And just as diners are finding reasons why to cut back on their Shake Shack burgers or Chipotle bowls, investors are trimming their fast-casual holdings after rewarding the companies last year for outperforming the rest of the industry.

On the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, Sweetgreen's Neman said that the chain saw "a more cautious consumer environment starting in April" — coinciding with the drop in consumer sentiment. To improve its value perception among customers, Sweetgreen is increasing its chicken and tofu portions by 25%, improving its chicken and salmon recipes and implementing some promotional pricing, like $13 menu bowl drops for its loyalty program members. Executives said that it faced difficult comparisons to the year-ago period's same-store sales growth of 14.4%, which was fueled by its own steak launch and strong demand at newer restaurant locations that waned this year.

Article: Protests and vigils have taken place around the world in support of Palestinians suffering in Gaza and to pay tribute to the four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers killed by Israel in the besieged enclave in a deliberate targeted assassination on Sunday. Journalists, students, activists and members of civil society – notably in Cape Town, South Africa; Manila, the Philippines; and London, the United Kingdom – held the protests on Wednesday to call on their governments to put pressure on Israel to allow international media into Gaza and bring an end to Israel’s genocidal war there. Late on Sunday, Al Jazeera correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, along with cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal, were killed in an Israeli strike that had targeted their media tent located by al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Sharif had been one of Gaza’s most recognisable faces for his constant reporting of the reality on the ground since Israel’s war on Gaza began following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. South Africa Members of civil society and journalists gathered at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town on Wednesday to express their anger at al-Sharif’s murder, sporting placards with one reading “your voice was louder than their bombs”. Advertisement The location is significant, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Cape Town, as “it’s been an important signal against oppression here in South Africa, especially during the decades of apartheid”. “People here are angry.” Journalist Zubeida Jaffer told Miller, “I was one of the journalists who were targeted, you know those media that documented apartheid, so this really resonates with me.” Miller said, “The South African government has previously condemned the killing of journalists in Gaza, specifically in 2022 when Shireen Abu Akleh was killed. The South African government had said it was a violation of international law.” Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American journalist who worked as a reporter for 25 years for Al Jazeera, before she was killed by Israeli forces while covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. United Kingdom Reporters belonging to the UK branches of the National Union of Journalists paid their respects on Wednesday to the slain Al Jazeera workers outside the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street, said Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from London. The reporters, holding placards bearing the names of journalists killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began, read out the names of each journalist that appeared on their placard and “symbolically, recited Islamic funeral prayers” for those killed on Sunday, said Hull. Those present “have really condemned the British government … talking about its complicity in what is going on in Gaza, for not doing more and speaking out more,” said Hull. While British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday “talked about his grave concern” about the killings of the Al Jazeera journalists, those present on Wednesday “want outright condemnation and nothing less”, said Hull. “They also want the government to take firm steps to pressure the Israeli government to ensure the safety of journalists in Gaza, importantly to allow international journalists into Gaza to be able to work freely there and for an independent investigation to be carried out by … the International Criminal Court in order to provide justice and accountability for those involved.” Advertisement Last week, Starmer condemned Israel’s plans to take over Gaza City, saying they were “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”. He has also announced that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel meets certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of a two-state solution. “They also describe the accusation that Anas al-Sharif, one of the most prominent voices reporting from within Gaza, is a member of Hamas is baseless,” said Lo, noting that protesters say “this is an age-old tactic used by governments who are bent on silencing the truth”. These protesters also gathered to urge “the international community to ramp up pressure on Israel to stop its genocide, including for the Philippine government to cut its trade and defence ties with Israel”, said Lo.

Article: “Now we’ve got sales slowing because [the pre-tariff buying] surge pretty much pulled ahead a lot of people that might have been in the market this year, who wanted to buy before tariffs hit,” Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told Al Jazeera. “If consumers don’t have the resilience to pay for those higher prices, they’ll take a step back.” United States President Donald Trump’s erratic approach to tariffs, putting some in place and then taking them away, has made it difficult for businesses to plan. In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. “The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera. EVs hit hard Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall. The payback period will be longer.” Manufacturing strains While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.

Article: Although her condition forced her to spend most of her childhood at a nursing home, she has resided in her own home for years with the help of personal assistants she hires under a New York State Medicaid program. “But it’s hard when you have to tell your new hires, ‘I can’t guarantee you’re going to get paid on time or get the appropriate amount of hours.’” Christian is not the only one affected by the state program’s recent takeover. NBC News spoke with nine consumers and personal assistants who described multiple problems since Public Partnerships LLC (PPL) won the $1 billion, five-year contract in 2024, replacing roughly 600 entities that had been administering the program. Its takeover as the program’s sole administrator triggered an avalanche of complaints from consumers unable to reach anyone to answer questions and assistants unpaid for hours they worked and unhappy with reduced health insurance benefits, according to lawmakers, consumer advocates and the consumers and assistants interviewed by NBC News. Amanda Lothrop, chief operating officer for New York State’s Medicaid program, told NBC News that the transition to PPL aimed to eliminate the former program’s administrative inefficiencies while protecting taxpayers. In response to questions from NBC News, PPL and the New York state health department said together they had identified 30 instances of home care workers under the previous system billing consumers who were hospitalized or dead, five cases of workers billing for work with consumers who were out of the country, one worker claiming to work for two people at the same time and another who claimed to be in two places simultaneously. “In partnership with PPL,” the department of health said in a statement, it “is using enhanced data and monitoring tools to protect program integrity, support consumers, and take timely action when issues arise.” Meg Fitzgerald, a PPL spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company’s “systems and centralized control processes would have been able to identify and prevent these violations.” The contract New York State awarded to PPL is a recent example of private equity’s increasing involvement in home health care, said Aditi Sen, managing director of research and campaigns at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that advocates for fairness in the U.S. Last month, Sen published a report detailing the industry’s forays into home health care entitled, “Wall Street on Your Doorstep: Protecting Home Care from Private Equity Abuses.” “The private equity industry is looking for any streams of steady public funding,” Sen said in an interview. “As advocates have secured more funding for home and community-based services, that has resulted in the private equity encroachment.” She said the next step for researchers is to analyze the quality of home care after private equity gets involved. Founded in 1999, PPL calls itself an industry leader “in financial management services for consumer direction, serving consumers throughout the U.S.” As for the difficulties in the New York program, the PPL spokeswoman said in a statement: “The transition to a single fiscal intermediary required a significant element of education and, in some cases, a change in practices for submitting and approving time. Ultimately, we strive to provide the accountability this program deserves.” Three CEOs in five years Private equity firms have taken over wide swaths of the health care industry in recent years and ill effects on care have been well-documented in independent academic research. PPL’s website does not identify its owners, but a recent court ruling disclosed the two private equity firms that control it — DW Healthcare Partners of Toronto and Park City, UT, and Linden Capital Partners of Chicago. In a lawsuit filed last year against New York’s Department of Health by a home care company over the transition to PPL, the company’s private equity owners were identified in a document that PPL requested the judge keep under seal. If the information were made public, the company argued, it “may put individuals in danger and/or allow them to become targets of violence.” Public disclosure would also increase the risk of “unwanted attention and harassment,” PPL said. The rule mandated that at least 80% of Medicaid payments go to compensation for direct care workers, such as personal assistants, not a company’s “administrative overhead or profit.” Fitzgerald said the company’s objections were not about worker compensation. Rather, she said, the company believed the rule would “make it more difficult for states to initiate new self-directed programs and to maintain small self-directed programs.” Participants in the CDPAP program aren’t the only ones experiencing upheaval in the transition to PPL. “I uploaded them nine times before they were finally accepted in their system.” Murphy’s hourly pay with PPL was 2% less than she had previously earned, she said, and she never received the correct pay under the new program. “Last year, when it was pushed upon us in the budget process I said back then that I thought it was a bad idea,” Rivera said of the switch to PPL. “Unfortunately, what I heard from my constituents is the transition was indeed bungled.” Meanwhile, Christian, the Buffalo mom who has lost five personal assistants since PPL took over, is especially worried about how it might impact her daughter.

Article: If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court. Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said. Advertisement In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers. Advertisement Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.” Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants. Advertisement The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.” Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions. The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.” California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law. “We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues. Advertisement The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out. Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities. “But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country. “The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote. In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it. They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.” The judge presiding over the case has yet to rule on the preliminary injunction.

Article: Since returning to power nearly seven months ago, Donald Trump has taken steps to exert unusual influence and control over everything from the economy to higher education, the judiciary to the media, private businesses to nonprofit organizations, the military to museums, labor unions to law enforcement, health care to sports teams, independent federal agencies to banks, the legal profession to the entertainment industry. NBC News reported: President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would host this year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony, his latest move to revamp the Washington, D.C., cultural institution in his image. He didn’t explain who “they” might be, but Trump appointed himself chair of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees earlier this year, and he started naming loyalists to leadership roles at the institution while purging its traditionally bipartisan board. To hear the Republican tell it, he has maintained a hands-on role, personally rejecting prospective Kennedy Center honorees whom he considered “wokesters.” As for this year’s Kennedy Center honorees, the list includes singer George Strait, actor and comedian Michael Crawford, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor and the band Kiss. So to review, the sitting American president, who presumably has a day job that keeps him rather busy, has found time to lead the Kennedy Center, personally scrutinize prospective honorees, agree to host the center’s upcoming awards ceremony and approve an honor for one of his pals.

The coast guard said in a statement that the death toll stood at 26, but was still “provisional and being updated.” Based on survivor accounts, about 95 migrants left Libya on two boats, International Organization for Migration spokesperson Flavio Di Giacomo said. Lampedusa Mayor Filippo Mannino said that the shipwreck happened “presumably at dawn.” So far this year, 675 migrants have died making the perilous central Mediterranean crossing, not counting the latest sinking, according to the U.N.

Bessent, who was formerly the top investor for the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros, said that he would do so to “avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest.” Cabinet officials are required to shed certain holdings and investments within 90 days of being confirmed to avoid the potential for conflicts of interest. Trump has pushed the boundaries of traditional government ethics norms by publicly pushing his business interests, and top Trump administration officials have reached unusual ethics agreements that have allowed them to oversee government matters that involve former lobbying clients or could benefit family members.

The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Article: Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and another possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case Weinstein could be sentenced next month, if no retrial on unresolved rape charge Harvey Weinstein appears in state court in Manhattan after a mistrial on a rape charge, Wednesday, Aug. (Steven Hirsch /New York Post via AP, Pool) NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein faces sentencing and a possible retrial in his New York City sex crimes case, but when they’ll happen — and whether he’ll be back in front of another jury — is still up in the air. At the same time, the jury acquitted him of forcing oral sex on another woman, one-time model Kaja Sokola, but couldn’t decide a charge that he raped hairstylist and actor Jessica Mann in 2013. Manhattan prosecutors told Farber that they’re ready to take Weinstein to trial for a third time on the rape charge, which is punishable by up to four years in prison. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala agreed, telling Farber he’d prefer a trial at “the earliest the court can accommodate us.” Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said she would ask Mann and other witnesses about their availability for a trial in the fall. If a fall trial happens, it would likely put Weinstein’s high-profile #MeToo case back in court as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in the final throes of his reelection bid. Bragg, a first-term Democrat who made prosecuting sex crimes cases a priority, has expressed satisfaction with Weinstein's conviction on a criminal sex act charge in the Haley assault and has been resolute in wanting the Oscar-winning studio boss retried on the Mann rape charge. “This work, first and foremost, is about the survivors and that’s why we’re prepared to go forward.” Aidala told reporters outside court that, in his view, it’s on prosecutors to resolve the rape charge — either by dropping it and clearing the way for sentencing, or promptly taking it to trial again. The “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love” producer is committed to fighting the rape charge at another trial, Aidala said, though the lawyer didn’t rule out the possibility of reaching a deal with prosecutors to end the case.

Article: Spencer Platt | Getty Images Goldman Sachs is taking the heat for its call that heavier tariff-induced consumer inflation is ahead, but it's far from alone in that view among its Wall Street brethren. "There is considerable uncertainty around the degree of pass-through to consumer prices, given that this year's tariff increases are well larger than anything in the post-war US experience." President Donald Trump lambasted Goldman Sachs on Tuesday for research the firm's economists released over the weekend asserting that consumers will take on a significantly stronger hit from tariffs through the end of the year. Inflation to creep higher Most see at least a steady grind higher in prices as tariff clarity emerges and what looks to be effective rates around 18% — compared with around 3% at the start of the year — take root, with some caveats. "We expect inflation to continue on a gradual upward trend as businesses pass along their higher costs, but slowing shelter inflation and push-back from increasingly stretched consumers should help offset some of the tariff impact." To be sure, no one is calling for runaway inflation — more like monthly gains of 0.3%-0.5%. Moreover, whatever the acceleration ends up being, it's not expected to dissuade the Fed from starting to lower interest rates after staying on the sidelines through all of 2025 so far. JPMorgan sees the hit to gross domestic product, two-thirds of which comes from consumption, at "a bit under 1%." The Blue Chip Economic Indicators report for August, which surveys the leading economic names on Wall Street, sees GDP growth averaging just 0.85% in the second half of this year. But that's actually better than the 0.75% forecast from July as some of the most pessimistic forecasters changed their outlooks on the view "that the constraining effect of tariffs is expected to be temporary, as projected growth improves considerably next year," the August report said.

Article: Arab governments that for decades have been fierce advocates for the Palestinian cause are now facing criticism for their timid response to the extreme suffering in Gaza caused by Israel's war, risking a dangerous rift with their increasingly restive citizens. As deaths from starvation and Israeli bombardment have mounted, Palestinians, their supporters and some analysts have directed their anger toward Arab rulers in the region whom they perceive as being too passive and quiet. Khames Alrefi / Anadolu via Getty Images Wafaa Eeed, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, told NBC News last month that she had walked several miles to a GHF aid distribution site on July 24, a day set aside only for women. The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request to comment on the incident, but at the time it told the BBC that early in the day it had "identified suspects who approached them, posing a threat to the troops" and "fired warning shots." It was not aware of casualties, and the shots were fired "hundreds of meters away" from the GHF site before its opening hours, it said. Palestine reminds Arabs of the hegemony and domination and the continuing colonialism and imperialism of the West." He added, “I would say that Gaza, the tragedy of Gaza, the destruction of Gaza, could really serve as a time bomb that implodes the Arab political order from within.” Polling before Oct. The Gulf states rarely allow protests, but they have largely maintained diplomatic and trade links with Israel throughout its devastating offensive in the Gaza strip that began after the Hamas-led Oct. “Despite the genocide, in the middle of the genocide, this extraordinary depravity that we see in Gaza, not a single Arab state that has relations with Israel has cut relations with Israel, although other states in other parts of the world have,” said Ussama Makdisi, professor of history and chancellor’s chair at the University of California, Berkeley. Houthi rebels, who control large parts of Yemen, have fired missiles and drones at Israel and ships in the region in what they say is an attempt to end Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but Yemen is alone among Arab states in pressuring Israel militarily. In Jordan, tensions between Palestinian militant groups and the ruling monarchy exploded into the “Black September” civil war in 1970, leading to the militants’ eventual expulsion and relocation to Lebanon. The presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon in the 1970s exacerbated the country’s civil war and triggered an Israeli invasion in 1982 to target “Palestinian terrorists.” More recently, Israel invaded Lebanon last year, heavily bombing southern Beirut in an offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, which had been firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Hamas. “The Palestinians, both the cause, the PLO and the population, in the Jordanian and Lebanese examples, have both been seen as a threat to the rule of these Arab regimes,” Crocker told NBC News. and Israel had floated plans for Arab countries to accept tens of thousands of Gaza refugees, but the idea was flatly rejected, with those Arab countries fearing both renewed Palestinian militancy and accusations of aiding ethnic cleansing, experts say.

Phelps added: “Let’s get in the water and learn how to swim!” In addition to the Ravens, 10 children from the Boys & Girls Club were learning how to swim right alongside them.

Article: Communities raise over $46K in cash, supplies during 2025 Share Your School Supplies for teachers During ABC13's Share Your School Supplies Drive 2025, people from across the Houston area, and really, southeast Texas, pulled together to raise money and collect supplies for teachers, and ultimately, students. During ABC13's Share Your School Supplies Drive 2025, people from across the Houston area, and really, southeast Texas, pulled together to raise money and collect supplies for teachers, and ultimately, students. HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The community has once again shown that it supports its teachers like no other through the 2025 Share Your School Supplies Drive, benefiting the Houston Food Bank's School Programs. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring "If you want to be educated right, you need the right resources." Here's how the community stepped up for teachers in Spring during Share Your School Supplies. We believe that we have to give back to our educators, our stations, and other organizations that helped build the community the way it is." Volunteers of all ages and across the city also recognized just how large of an impact these school supplies can make. "I think it's really important to be donating school supplies because if you want to be educated right, you need the right resources to be going to school every day, going to college every day," one Texas A &M University student helping at the Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Spring told ABC13. WATCH: Sights and sounds from Ismaili Jamatkhana and Center in Sugar Land Sugar Land was one of five areas where the community showed up and showed out to make sure area teachers have what they need. "We may have a child that may come and needs some supplies, and it'll be there for them, so it just helps us to continue to help our young people." Nivens said that with a ban now on digital devices, some of the most-needed supplies included pens and paper as well as hand sanitizer, folders, and tissue. Now in its second year, the 2025 drive, sponsored by Amazon and Terry Bryant, featured Eyewitness News anchors and reporters going live across southeast Texas from multiple school supply collection sites on Friday, Aug. "Our employees are passionate about education, and anything we can do to support students and teachers in our community, we want to be able to do, so here they are handing out school supplies and wanting to be engaged in this event," said Vickie Yakunin, head of community engagement at Amazon. "This helps build the confidence as well in the children, so we're trying to alleviate that sacrifice from teachers who are pulling out of their own pockets to do so." "We want to be there for the children to help instead," Rascon added. According to the food bank, teachers are eligible to receive help if they're in urban schools in which 90% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch or teachers in rural schools in which 70% of students are on free or reduced-price lunch and who participate in Houston Food Bank's Backpack Buddy Program or School Market Program. The Kids in Need Foundation's 2023-2024 Impact Report found that 62% of students arrive without the necessary supplies on their first day; 62% of students did not have access to necessary supplies at home and 69% of students did not have second semester replacement supplies. A 2022 CNN Business report further breaks down the sharp increase in supply costs: All varieties of 3M's Scotch - branded tape surged in price nearly 70% in 2022 compared to 2021 Sharpies and Elmer's Glue were up nearly 55% and 30% respectively in 2022 Shoppers were also paying about 12% more for BIC pens Meanwhile, Adopt A Classroom's Spring 2025 survey found that teacher spending out of pocket is still high at $895 during the 2024-2025 school year. Teachers reported to the Kids in Need Foundation that when students had the right supplies, students' ideas flourished, their confidence grew, and their genuine interest in learning began to develop.

Article: Despite being American citizens, three children — a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl — were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families. The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms. “The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States. “This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News. “Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.” McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.” NBC News has previously reported on U.S. Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.” Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states. Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras. “When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.” DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Article: Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has signed into law a controversial piece of legislation that would shield the military, police and other government-sanctioned forces from prosecution for human rights abuses committed during the country’s decades-long internal conflict. On Wednesday, Boluarte held a signing ceremony at the presidential palace in Lima, where she defended the amnesty law as a means of honouring the sacrifices made by government forces. “It brings justice and honour to those who stood up to terrorism.” But human rights groups and international observers have condemned the bill as a violation of international law — not to mention a denial of justice for the thousands of survivors who lived through the conflict. In the case of the current amnesty law, nine UN experts issued a joint letter in July condemning its passage as a “clear breach of [Peru’s] obligations under international law”. But at Wednesday’s signing ceremony, President Boluarte reiterated her position that such international criticism was a violation of her country’s sovereignty and that she would not adhere to the Inter-American Court’s decision. Drawing from Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, the human rights group Amnesty International estimates that the country’s armed forces and police were responsible for 37 percent of the deaths and disappearances that happened during the conflict.

Article: Six reputed members and associates of the Hoover Criminal Gang were arrested Wednesday in what authorities called the first major takedown of a sex trafficking operation in the Figueroa Corridor of South Los Angeles. The Hoovers largely controlled sex trafficking and prostitution along a 3.5-mile stretch of Figueroa Street between approximately Slauson Avenue and Century Boulevard from February 2021 to August 2025, according to a 155-page federal indictment charging 11 people. Advertisement Victims were recruited through false promises of a luxurious lifestyle, intimidation, and actual or threatened violence and were plied with drugs ranging from the synthetic painkiller oxycodone to amphetamines, according to the indictment. Indicted alongside Armstead were Kenyondre Young, 22; Naziz Harris, 19; Derail Robinson, 22; Jalon Phillips, 22; Bryan Isrel, 31, Tejohn Gray, 25; and Tommy Crockham, 30, — all from South L.A. Advertisement Along with the RICO charge, the defendants are facing various other charges, including sex trafficking of minors; sex trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion; transportation of a minor for sex trafficking; sexual exploitation of a child; drug trafficking conspiracy; money laundering to promote specified unlawful activity; and conspiracy to straw purchase firearms. Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in L.A., called the operation “the first step in returning the Figueroa Corridor — long known as prostitution haven — back to its residents who have suffered for too long while criminals were allowed to run amok.” Advertisement “There are no meaningful consequences for their conduct under state law, so the federal government — aided by its local law enforcement partners — will step in to make sure these criminals face lengthy prison sentences,” Essayli said in a news release. Gang members and associates allegedly acted as pimps “by managing and monitoring their victims, pooling resources to rent several motel rooms for commercial sex dates … and sending each other money via Cash App and Apple Pay,” according to the U.S. Prosecutors said sex workers were required to have their hair and nails done at all times “because their grooming was a status symbol that reflected on her pimp.” Advertisement Victims were also branded with tattoos of a defendant’s moniker, according to the indictment. In one case in April 2022, Gray and two accomplices drove to an area of San Bernardino notorious for prostitution activities and allegedly attempted to force two women into their car. In April 2024, according to the indictment, Armstead and Evans allegedly rented rooms at the Stadium Inn, a South Los Angeles motel, including one in which a 14-year-old girl was sex trafficked for at least three consecutive days. Gang members also allegedly posted videos and photographs of their assaults on others to social media, “in order to intimidate their victims and ensure their compliance in performing commercial sex work for the enrichment of their pimps and the Hoover gang itself.” If convicted, some defendants would face a minimum of 15 years and potentially up to life in federal prison.

Link: https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/human-rights-abuse-report-state-department-rcna224814
Article: Last month, I wrote about how the Trump administration’s deep cuts to the State Department budget and workforce had delayed a congressionally authorized annual report that the State Department compiles on international human rights. As NBC News noted, the report is a tenth as long as last year’s report and has already been condemned by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In a departure from previous reports, the Trumpified version completely omits sections dedicated to abuses against women and LGBTQ people, while criticizing “free speech” abuses by countries like Brazil and members of the European Union for attempting to curb the spread of far-right disinformation and hate speech. In the case of Brazil, the report also says the country’s judiciary has unfairly oppressed followers of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who is under house arrest while he is on trial on charges of plotting a coup (a charge he denies). For example, despite extensive documentation of human rights abuses by El Salvador’s MAGA-aligned, self-described dictator Nayib Bukele, the State Department claimed to find no “significant” abuses in the country to which the Trump administration renditioned several hundred immigrants. In its section on Israel, West Bank and Gaza, the report lists under the category “War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, and Evidence of Acts that May Constitute Genocide, or Conflict-related Abuses” only the following: “Terrorist organizations Hamas and Hizballah continue to engage in the indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians in violation of the law of armed conflict.” The report makes no reference to Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza or to tactics that some international groups have gone so far as to label genocide. Here’s how State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce characterized the revised report, according to NBC News: ‘The Human Rights Report has been restructured in a way that removes redundancy, increases report readability, and is responsive to the legislative mandates that underpin the report, rather than an expansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,’ Bruce said. I tend to think the statement given to NBC News last week by an unnamed department official ahead of the report’s release is a bit more apt, if not honest: ‘We call out certain abuses that we think deserve highlighting, but just because we focus on one instance does not mean that we are not aware of other instances of human rights abuses,’ the official added, noting that all 198 countries and territories were listed in the reports. So given the opportunity to call out human rights abuses, like those that target women and LGBTQ people, where it knows they exist, this administration seems to prefer to misuse this report to point to policies and places that don’t align with its right-wing ideology.

READ MORE: Floodwaters from Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau break record levels and prompt evacuations A search was also ongoing Wednesday for a man who walked through a flooded road in Chattanooga on Tuesday night but hadn’t been seen since, Maxwell said. Troy Plemons, a communications systems technician for EPB, Chattanooga’s electricity and telecommunications utility, said he was stuck in traffic on an interstate in his bucket truck for two to three hours on Tuesday evening when the area started to flood quickly. Then Plemons said he saw the water pick up an SUV, and when he and two Lawson Electric workers encouraged a woman inside to get out, she threw up her hands like she didn’t know if she could. “I tried my best.” Plemons said the water was reaching neck level for the woman in the SUV when he used a boring bit offered by the Lawson Electric workers to break the window and helped the woman get out. “I was doing everything I could to get her out because the water was rising pretty quick.” He helped the woman to the road and she sat down in his vehicle to warm up for a while. There were several rescues of people whose cars were overwhelmed by water in the area until the water receded about two to three hours later and traffic began to move again, Plemons said. “I’m thankful I was there to help that lady.” The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of middle Tennessee through Wednesday night, warning of scattered flash flooding with tropical-like heavy rainfall and the possibility of training storms, especially over already saturated areas. The airport in Chattanooga recorded more than 6.4 inches (about 16 centimeters) of rain Tuesday, marking the second-wettest day recorded for the city dating back to 1879, according to a social media post by the National Weather Service in Morristown.

Article: WASHINGTON — Billy Joel's beloved Long Island motorcycle shop is closing down after nearly 15 years of offering fans a free peek at his personal collection of dozens of bikes. The music icon will be shuttering 20th Century Cycles in Oyster Bay, New York, in late September and auctioning off his collection later this year because of a brain disorder he has been diagnosed with, according to a spokesperson, Claire Mercuri. In May, Joel announced that he was canceling upcoming concerts after learning he has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, a fluid buildup in his brain that can affect thinking, concentrating, memory, movement and more, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel, who grew up in nearby Hicksville, opened 20th Century Cycles in late 2010 as a place to maintain and repair his motorcycles, restore and customize ones he bought and showcase his collection for the public at no charge. Because it’s starting to be a lost aesthetic.” He said he also wanted to bring foot traffic and business to downtown Oyster Bay — a ritzy waterfront community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of midtown Manhattan — where part of the street that includes 20th Century Cycles was renamed Billy Joel Way in 2023.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can suspend or terminate billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated funding for foreign aid. “The parties also dispute the scope of the district court’s remedy but we need not resolve it … because the grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,” Henderson wrote. “The majority opinion thus misconstrues the separation-of-powers claim brought by the grantees, misapplies precedent, and allows Executive Branch officials to evade judicial review of constitutionally impermissible actions.” The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for USAID to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs.

Article: A weak jobs report earlier this month revealed a sharp slowdown of the labor market, which could prompt the Fed to reduce borrowing costs as a means of warding off an economic slowdown, even if it opens up the possibility of higher inflation. Employers added an average of about 35,000 jobs over three months ending in July, which marks a major slowdown from roughly 128,000 jobs added monthly over the prior three months, the U.S. "The Fed will probably choose to make a cut in response." Economists acknowledged that tariff-induced inflation effects could lag behind the onset of the policy, giving policymakers a misguided sense of comfort with price levels. "It’s just coupled with a relatively worsening labor market." President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura/Reuters Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly urged the central bank to lower interest rates, saying the policy would boost economic performance and reduce interest payments on government debt. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate," Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday, referring to the Fed chair, just hours after the favorable inflation report. "The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." In recent weeks, Trump has also slammed Powell, citing cost overruns tied to the central bank’s $2.5 billion building renovation project. The Fed attributes spending overruns to unforeseen cost increases, saying that its building renovation will ultimately "reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations," according to the central bank's website. Some analysts said central bankers may lean toward a rate cut in part due to Trump’s urgings, while others said the Fed would make its decision based solely on economic data. Political independence, Powell said last month, gives central bankers the "ability to make these very challenging decisions in ways that are focused on the data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks – and not on political factors."

Article: Taylor Swift's fondness for dropping clues and making sleuths out of her most dedicated fans is on full display this week after she announced her upcoming 12th album, "The Life Of A Showgirl." The pop sensation has left quite a few blank spaces for fans after announcing the album title on her website at 12:12 a.m. Fans are doing their best Sherlock impressions With so little — but so much — to go on, fans are in a tizzy trying to decipher what clues Swift may have dropped about the new album. The door is also the same one seen in visuals during “The Eras Tour” at the end of the show when Swift performed “Karma.” The padlock appears to have an imprint of a key in the same shape as “The Eras Tour" stage. Swifties believe this could be the sign she's diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who has been the producer on her most recent albums, for "The Life of a Showgirl." The phrase “And, baby, that’s show business for you" also appeared when you googled Swift's name on Tuesday.

The man, Shane Daley, left Paulette Thompson profanity-laced voicemails calling her husband a "f------ capitalist pig" and declaring he died because he was "profiting off the backs of poor Americans," according to a criminal complaint in Albany federal court charging Daley with cyberstalking. "This s--- is gonna keep happening to you f------ p-----," Daley, 40, warned Paulette in one of three voicemails he left on her work phone in Minnesota the night of Dec.

Article: A federal judge has ordered Ohio State University to resolve via mediation the remaining lawsuits filed by former students who claim it failed to protect them from a sexual predator on the school payroll. “Yet it is today’s Ohio State that must reckon with the consequences of that ugly past in these cases.” If the case went to trial and the accusers won, it would be a “pyrrhic” victory, Watson wrote. “The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education, is through a mutual resolution short of a trial,” the judge wrote. Watson, in his order, referred the cases to Layn Phillips, a former Oklahoma federal judge who mediated the lawsuits filed against Michigan State by some 200 women athletes who were sexually abused by sports doctor Larry Nasser. 27, 2026 to provide the court with a progress report “at which point the Court will consider whether additional mediation would be productive.” In the meantime, lawyers for OSU and the plaintiffs will be allowed to continue taking depositions from witnesses. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994 before he got into politics, four plaintiffs in lawsuits against the university told NBC News last month. He was deposed about a month after the release of an HBO Max documentary about the Strauss scandal called “Surviving Ohio State,” in which one of the wrestlers he once coached called him a liar. A spokesperson for Ohio State, Benjamin Johnson, also declined to comment, saying via email, “We don’t typically comment on pending litigation." Ohio State found itself under fire in 2018 after a whistleblowing former wrestler named Mike DiSabato went public with allegations that Strauss had sexually abused him and hundreds of other athletes and that the school knew about it but did nothing to stop him. An independent investigation sponsored by Ohio State and conducted by the Perkins Coie law firm concluded in May 2019 that Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male athletes and students and that coaches and administrators knew about it for two decades but failed to stop him. Since the release of the report, OSU has said it has paid out $60 million in settlement money and its former president has publicly apologized “to each person who endured” abuse at the hands of Strauss.

Article: The two-to-one ruling on Wednesday overturned a previous injunction that required the Department of State to resume the payments, including about $4bn for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and $6bn for HIV and AIDS programmes. However, the panel’s third judge — Florence Pan, nominated under former President Joe Biden — issued a dissenting opinion that argued Trump should not be allowed to violate the separation of powers by cutting the aid. “The court’s acquiescence in and facilitation of the Executive’s unlawful behaviour derails the carefully crafted system of checked and balanced power that serves as the greatest security against tyranny — the accumulation of excessive authority in a single Branch,” Pan wrote in her opinion. Republicans, however, control both houses of Congress, and in July, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 2025, allowing the government to claw back nearly $9bn in foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. US District Judge Amir Ali previously ruled that the Trump administration must pay its agreed-upon funds to humanitarian groups and other contractors that partnered with the government to distribute aid.

Article: President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he will seek more permanent federal control of the Washington, D.C., police force as he continues his efforts to ramp-up crime enforcement in the nation's capital. Earlier this week, Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops in the nation's capital, declaring a public safety emergency in order to put the Washington police department under federal control and station the National Guard on the city's streets. Asked Wednesday whether he'd work with Congress to extend the emergency authorization allowing him to seize temporary control of local law enforcement, Trump said he'll ask Congress for a "long-term" extension of federal control of the Washington police force. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images "We're going to be asking for extensions on that -- long-term extensions, because you can't have 30 days," Trump said at an event at the Kennedy Center Wednesday afternoon. Trump has long threatened to take control of Washington, saying he wants to crack down on violent crime in the District although police statistics show that in the past two years, violent crime has fallen dramatically.

We all get a bit dizzy watching Trump’s pirouettes on the war in Ukraine: Just recently, he was denouncing Russia for its “disgusting” attacks on Ukraine, declaring that “we’re going to put sanctions” on Russia. It’s likewise fair for Trump to press each side to compromise, and many Ukrainians seem ready to make concessions: More than two-thirds said in a Gallup poll that they favor a speedy negotiated end to the war, rather than fighting on until victory.

Article: The White House’s announced review is a challenge to the Smithsonian, which has traditionally operated as an independent institution and regards itself as being outside the control of the executive branch. The White House said the review is aimed at portraying a more uplifting view of American history, but the administration has not specified who would be involved in evaluating the Smithsonian content. The White House did say the review would involve collaboration among museum staff, administration officials and personnel from other agencies, though it did not say what those other agencies are. Trump has been at odds with historians since his first term, when many criticized his push to promote what he sees as “patriotic history.” Early in his second term, he stirred deep alarm when he issued an executive order, titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which criticized what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” That order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” It directed Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to take action to redirect it toward promoting “American greatness.”

In July, when Trump first announced the plan, Robert Perosa, president of industry trade group Brazilian Beef Exporters Associations (ABIEC), said that the tariffs would make it “economically unfeasible” to continue to export to the US market.

In late July, the White House said that the order to impose this rate of tariffs is because of “the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that have undermined the rule of law in Brazil”.

This is another case where the administration is lying to the public,” said Adriana Cadena, director of the Protecting Immigration Families coalition, which led the organizations’ opposition to restrictions to be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). citizen child is entitled to use a program, the Trump administration's restrictions are likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding, Cadena said, because of the many children who are in families whose members have different types of immigration status. The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not “diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.” “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” HHS Secretary Robert F. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.” Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants The 1996 Personal Responsibility Reconciliation Act restricted the eligibility for federal public benefits to certain “qualified” immigrants, according to KFF, a health policy group. Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that "reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive." Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately.

Our suffering is worse than what you can imagine." Food is so scarce in el-Fasher that prices have soared to the point where money that used to cover a week's worth of meals can now buy only one. This may be the only meal these children get for a day The hunger crisis is compounded by a surge of cholera sweeping through the squalid camps of those displaced by the fighting, which escalated this week into one of the most intense RSF attacks on the city yet. The paramilitaries tightened their 14-month blockade after losing control of the capital Khartoum earlier this year, and stepped up their battle for el-Fasher, the last foothold of the armed forces in Darfur. The UN has amplified its appeal for a humanitarian pause to allow food convoys into the city, with its Sudan envoy Sheldon Yett once more demanding this week that the warring sides observe their obligations under international law. "We have many malnourished children admitted in hospital but unfortunately there is no single sachet of [therapeutic food]," says Dr Ibrahim Abdullah Khater, a paediatrician at the Al Saudi Hospital, noting that the five severely malnourished children currently in the ward also have medical complications. Unfortunately, the international community is just watching." International non-governmental organisations working in Sudan issued an urgent statement this week declaring that "sustained attacks, obstruction of aid and targeting of critical infrastructure demonstrate a deliberate strategy to break the civilian population through hunger, fear, and exhaustion". Makeshift centres have been built to treat patients who have cholera Unlike el-Fasher, in Tawila aid workers at least have access, but their supplies are limited, says John Joseph Ocheibi, the on-site project coordinator for a group called The Alliance for International Medical Action. "We are mobilizing resources to see how best we can be able to respond." Sylvain Penicaud of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) estimates there are only three litres of water per person per day in the camps, which, he says, is "way below the basic need, and forces people to get water from contaminated sources".

The falsehood-per-sentence ratio in this little missive was, in a rather literal sense, 1:1, though it is interesting to see Team Trump add crime statistics to its list of “fake” things, joining U.S. What’s more, let’s not forget that the FBI’s controversial director appeared at the president’s press conference on Monday, when Patel boasted from the White House podium, “The murder rates are plummeting. history.” That was true, though if Miller correct, the boast from Trump’s FBI director should be discarded — because crime stats in cities led by Democratic officials are “fake,” which necessarily throws off the bureau’s figures.

Article: is not short, but this was especially egregious: The conspiracy theorist, who has a lengthy record of promoting bizarre and unscientific ideas, announced that he and the Trump administration are terminating a series of federal contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines. Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, told The Associated Press: “I don’t think I’ve seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business.” Around the same time, Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as the surgeon general during Donald Trump’s first term, added via social media: “I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions — but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives.” The president tried to defend the decision, but failed. Bhattacharya, a deeply unfortunate choice to lead the NIH, conceded in his opinion piece that the mRNA platform is “promising,” and has the potential to “deliver breakthroughs.” So why in the world is the Republican administration, as Bhattacharya put it, “winding down its mRNA vaccine development activities”? His Post piece stressed a few points, but this was the heart of his defense: [A]s a vaccine intended for broad public use, especially during a public health emergency, the platform has failed a crucial test: earning public trust. The NIH director bolstered his point by pointing to polls showing Americans’ reluctance to get Covid booster shots, which were developed through mRNA research, before peddling some baseless claims about the Biden administration’s “scientific overreach” and “arrogance.” So, let’s take stock. “The vaccines that harnessed it against Covid saved an estimated 20 million lives, a rapid development that was recognized with a Nobel Prize.” The same Times report added that mRNA research has raised hopes of possible treatments — and perhaps even cures — for deadly cancers and a host of genetic and chronic diseases. Even Trump himself has celebrated mRNA vaccines — the president explicitly referred to them as a “modern-day miracle” — before he put the nation’s public health infrastructure in the hands of a guy who has claimed, among other things, that Wi-Fi causes “leaky brain.” But according to the NIH director, the scientific potential apparently doesn’t matter. What does matter, Bhattacharya argued, is that mRNA research hasn’t “earned public trust.” To be sure, I’m not in a position to say which areas of scientific research have been embraced by the American mainstream.

Article: Ahead of Donald Trump’s scheduled meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, The New York Times appeared to give the American president something new to talk about with his Russian counterpart. investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia “is at least partly responsible for a recent hack of the computer system that manages federal court documents, including highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes.” The report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, went on to note that administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.” Those with sensitive documents within the system have apparently been advised to quickly remove them. The internal memo to Justice Department officials and staffers from the courts system, according to the Times, added: “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.” This was, in other words, a rather serious cyberoffensive. After noting that he “could” bring this up during his scheduled talks with Putin, Trump added that Russian cyberattackers are “good at it.” In other words, there’s reason to believe a foreign adversary launched an offensive targeting highly sensitive U.S. The developments came on the heels of Trump backing off threatened sanctions on Russia — for the fifth time — and extending an invitation to Putin to come to American soil, giving the accused war criminal the validation he was looking for.

Article: MIAMI (AP) — The fate of a makeshift immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” hung in the balance on Wednesday as a federal judge considered whether building on sensitive wetlands violated environmental laws. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing, part of a lawsuit seeking to halt operations and further construction. DeSantis blindsided Florida county officials with ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ plans, emails show The judge concluded a multi-day hearing on Wednesday without making an immediate decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction. President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe have sued over the facility, saying it was hastily set up without the environmental impact considerations needed for all federal projects, even though it deals with immigration, a federal matter. Ron DeSantis has said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after. When asked by the judge why a detention facility needed to be located in the middle of the Everglades, Jesse Panuccio, an attorney representing the state of Florida, referred to government officials’ statements that the remote location and existing runway made it ideal for immigration detention. “Why in the middle of the Everglades?” Witnesses for the environmental groups have testified that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.

Article: Thousands of people in Eastern Canada are under evacuation orders and thousands more have been warned to be on high alert as quick-moving wildfires burn out of control during what has become Canada’s second-worst wildfire season on record. There are over 700 active fires in Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, the national firefighting coordinating body, and many large wildfires are occurring in parts of the country where fires typically stay small. Fewer acres may have burned this year compared with 2023, said Awa Cissé, a spokeswoman for the center, but the fire season can continue through September or October, she warned.

Article: Jeff Chiu | AP Perplexity AI's bid on Tuesday to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion represents a dramatic moment for the internet search giant, a week before it celebrates the 20th anniversary of its IPO. Department of Justice, which filed the landmark case against Google in 2020, indicated after its victory in court that it was considering a possible breakup of Google as an antitrust remedy. Google Legal Chief Kent Walker said in response to the DOJ that its "approach would result in unprecedented government overreach" and would harm the country's effort to maintain economic and tech leadership. The company is shelling out tens of billions of dollars a year on artificial intelligence infrastructure and AI services while facing the risk that consumers will be spending a lot less time on traditional search as ChatGPT and other AI-powered alternatives provide new ways to access information. "This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google," co-founder Larry Page said in a blog post at the time. Page moved from CEO of Google to become chief executive of Alphabet, promoting Sundar Pichai, who had been a senior vice president in charge of internet businesses, to run Google. With an increasingly dominant position on the internet, Pichai and team have had to continue looking for growth areas, particularly in AI, while simultaneously fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. Here's a breakdown of how some analysts value Alphabet's top non-search assets: Chrome watch now The browser is key to Alphabet's ad business, which uses data from Chrome to help with targeted advertisements. Google originally launched Chrome in 2008 as an effort to "add value for users and, at the same time, help drive innovation on the web." Perplexity's offer doesn't stack up to analyst estimates, but it's still much higher than Perplexity's own valuation, which reached $18 billion in July. If a deal for Chrome is on the table, analysts at Raymond James value the browser at $50 billion, based on 2.25 billion users and Google's revenue share agreements with phone manufacturers that preinstall Chrome on devices. Bob O'Donnell of market research firm TECHnalysis Research, cautioned that Chrome is "not directly monetizable," because it serves as a gateway and that it's "not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective." Google Cloud A person takes a photo of the Google Cloud logo, during the 2025 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, March 4, 2025. Albert Gea | Reuters Google's cloud unit, which is third in the cloud infrastructure market behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, is one of Alphabet's key growth engines and its biggest business outside of digital advertising. Demand is so high that the company's cloud services now have a backlog, a measure of future committed revenue, of $106 billion, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the earnings call. Davidson analysts, who have the highest ascribed valuation at $682 billion, and TD Cowen analysts note that while Google still trails AWS and Azure, it's growing faster than Amazon's cloud business and has the potential for a premium valuation. Mat Hayward | Variety | Getty Images Google's $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 is generally viewed as one of the best acquisitions ever by an internet company, alongside Facebook's $1 billion deal for Instagram in 2012. Dubbing it the "new king of all media," MoffettNathanson values YouTube at between $475 billion and $550 billion, arguing that it's larger and more powerful than any other player in Hollywood. When Alphabet was formed as Google's parent company, it created an "Other Bets" category to include businesses that it liked to call "moonshots," a term that had already made its way into Google lexicon.

Article: President Donald Trump announced federal take over of the Metropolitan Police Department under the Home Rule Act to assist in crime prevention in the nation’s capital, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 12, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump called Washington, D.C., a city overrun by "violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" as he moved to federalize the city's police force and deploy hundreds of National Guard members. His dire depiction of the nation's capital is at odds, however, with federal data showing that violent crime in the District has dropped to its lowest level in three decades. Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty Images Washington experienced a spike in crime in 2023, with the highest number of homicides reported in the District since the 1990s and a surge in the number of reported carjackings. Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst and co-founder of data analytics firm AH Datalytics, told CNBC that Americans broadly "always think crime is rising," even if the data shows otherwise. A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters — 68% — said that reducing crime should be a top policy priority for the president and Congress in 2024, compared to 47% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Asher told CNBC that policymakers should not "base their crime-reduction strategies and policy and programs on the perception issue." He said that policy decisions should be based on data, but to make "people feel safe, we have to address the perception issue." "I think that they're two very different sides of a similar coin," he continued.

He took a direct role in a peace pledge signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, at the White House, and there have been other regional conflicts in which he’s played an important role. Those, of course, are the Israel-Hamas war and the Russian war with Ukraine, which he famously declared that he would solve in 24 hours, on the basis of his long and, in his view, respectful relationship with Putin. He has now come to question whether that relationship is what he thought it was, or at least what he portrayed it as, because Putin has held a series of perfectly friendly, constructive phone calls with him and then continued on the same battle plan that he was on before, with considerable recent success.

Article: Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. — Adam Wollner Texas Democrats plot their exit strategy By Ben Kamisar and Natasha Korecki With Texas expected to end its first special legislative session Friday and immediately begin a new one, the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to block Republicans’ redistricting proposal are hammering out a plan for their return home. Texas Democrats met late into the night Tuesday then again Wednesday, including breaking into smaller groups, to discuss their next steps and what their ultimate exit strategy looked like after spending the last 10 days out of the state, according to four sources close to the talks. What we will do, what we’re going to do in the future, we’re in discussions right now,” Texas Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu said Wednesday on “Meet the Press NOW.” Wu said they would not finalize their next steps until there was “consensus among our membership.” But he noted Democrats have other avenues to push back against the GOP’s redistricting effort in the courts, through the legislative process and with other states, like California, countering with new congressional maps. We can throw everything at this.” Republican leaders in Texas have promised to call “special session after special session,” and they need just a handful of Democrats to relent in order to achieve a quorum in the state House so they can move forward with their redistricting plan. So while it appears likely that Democrats will succeed in delaying the process enough to force a second special session, there is an acknowledgement among the caucus that their protest will need to come to an end some point soon. The goal that the smartest among them set was: We need to bring national attention to this issue so other states are ready to counter if Republicans really do this,” one aide to a Texas House Democrat breaking quorum told NBC News. Alex Brandon / AP President Donald Trump is not just taking over the police in the nation’s capital, with FBI and DEA agents on nighttime patrols in Georgetown and armored vehicles lined up in front of the Washington Monument. Trump also told reporters he was “98%” involved in choosing this year’s honorees for one of the nation’s highest lifetime achievement awards: Sylvester Stallone, Michael Crawford, George Strait, Gloria Gaynor and Kiss. Unlike his predecessors, Trump never hosted the awardees at the White House nor attended the gala concert in his first term, citing criticism from some of the Hollywood stars being celebrated. Elsewhere in Washington, the administration now plans to put its stamp on eight of the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, including American history, African American history, air and space, and the National Museum of the American Indian. The criticism by many, if not most, historians is that this risks distorting the reality of America’s founding, which includes the reality that the genius of the Founding Fathers’ creation was scarred by the reality that they were all white, male and largely property owners — including many slave owners. It spawned a reckoning that eventually led to the brutality of the Civil War, followed by a century of legalized segregation, and continuing generational poverty and second-class citizenship for millions of Americans. The administration has already had an impact on the Smithsonian, whose board is led by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and by statute also includes the vice president. According to the 6,000-member Organization of American Historians, the nation’s museums and historic parks are “under assault” by Trump’s March 27 executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” A White House spokesman calls it common sense.

Article: Illinois courts will not force Texas Democrats back to the state, a judge ruled Wednesday, dealing a blow to Attorney General Ken Paxton and House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ efforts to restore the headcount necessary to pass the GOP’s new congressional map. Illinois courts’ cannot consider whether “foreign legislators” were willfully evading their duties, and they cannot direct Illinois law enforcement to execute civil quorum warrants upon “nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois,” Larson said, noting that the warrants specifically say they are to be enforced within Texas. Even if the court were to take up the case, which Larson ruled it lacks the ability to do, the response would be a ruling on whether the lawmakers are willfully disobeying a court order — not an order returning them to Texas as Paxton and Burrows demanded, Larson said. The county voted for Trump by 47 percentage points in 2024, suggesting Paxton was seeking a friendlier venue than he might have found in DuPage County — where the Democrats are staying — which went for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 14 points.

Article: Now researchers at UC Riverside have found that home sale prices are 2.4% to 5.4% lower than they would be if the land were stable, translating to per-home losses of $6,689 to $16,165. Mehdi Nemati, a UC Riverside assistant professor of environmental economics and policy who led the study, said his team knew that sinking land was already affecting homes and homeowners across the Central Valley, with cracking foundations, dry wells, higher insurance premiums and increased stress. “Land subsidence is a very slow problem.” The economists found that land subsidence has lowered the value of homes across eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley by $1.87 billion over the six-year period. “And I expect that land subsidence is going to be very low on their list of things that they think affect the price.” Agricultural wells have been drawing heavily on groundwater, lowering aquifer levels. In another recent study , Stanford University researchers also found that the problem has been worsening in recent years, and that large portions of the valley have subsided at a record pace since 2006. Advertisement The study’s findings show that lower home values are one more costly effect of chronic groundwater overpumping that warrants attention, said Amanda Fencl, climate science director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. The goal, Fencl said, should be to prevent the “very clear harms that are occurring from this extensive groundwater overuse.” She said she hopes the link between subsidence and home values will lead to a “rallying cry” from people in the valley who feel it’s unfair that “we aren’t the ones pumping, and yet you’re affecting our ability to maintain and sell our homes.” The researchers said it’s a major problem that requires big solutions — and fast. Areas with rapid subsidence dropped about 7 or more inches a year across the eight counties they studied, with parts of Tulare and Kings counties seeing the most dramatic movement, up to a foot or more a year. She blames the ongoing implementation of the state’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act as well as “bad actors,” including hedge funds and other outside investors that are among the region’s major water users.

Harvard may hold a place in the American psyche as the best of the best, but when it comes to actual impact, UCLA and the University of California system are in an entirely different league. Each year, UCLA alone contributes more than $2 billion to the local economy, and adds to the body of human knowledge with its unparalleled research in ways that money cannot quantify. “When you look at the UC just in terms of science and healthcare and helping to birth Silicon Valley, helping to birth the pharmaceutical industry, the UC has a cultural, educational and economic relevance unlike any other institution on the planet.” Advertisement The stakes are simply higher for California. “There is a difference between a Harvard and a UCLA, or UC Berkeley or UC San Diego or University of Michigan,” he said, and if the president managed to extract his pound of flesh, “it would bankrupt the No. But even with that win, the entire UC system remains in jeopardy of the president’s agenda, and there is no reason to believe the Supreme Court would side with California if or when the case made it that far. California ‘Bring it on, Gavin,’ White House says to Newsom on threat to sue over UCLA cuts The White House indicated Tuesday that it was ready to battle with Gov.

Article: In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin sees Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan off following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on Aug. AFP via Getty Images Russian media is crowing about the choice of location for the summit -- cheering the idea that Trump and Putin will decide the fate of the war alone and that Alaska's distance from Europe underlines how European countries and Ukraine are being sidelined. Some Russian media commentators also note how Alaska was once Russian territory, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the United States for a pittance in 1867 Many observers, particularly Russian, are dismissing the meeting as a sign Trump has allowed Putin to once again deceive him. Some Russian analysts have suggested the surprise summit, in fact, is a graceful way for both Putin and Trump to sidestep the awkward issue of Trump's own deadline last week to impose the new sanctions if Russia didn't end the war. "For Trump, it's an opportunity to save face in a situation when he actually has few ways of pressuring Moscow," Farida Rustamova and Margarita Lituova, Russian journalists who closely cover the Kremlin, wrote on their Substack. "For Putin, a personal meeting would help him to maintain a relationship with Trump, who is clearly inclined to sympathize with the Russian position." Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference during his visit to Vienna, Austria, June 16, 2025. has received a signal from Russia that it may be "ready to end the war, or at least to make a first step towards a ceasefire." "This was the first such signal from them," Zelenskyy told reporters. The Wall Street Journal and others have reported Putin is now demanding Ukraine hand over the remainder of unoccupied eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in exchange for halting his offensive on two other southeastern regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But those demands would still be extreme -- Ukraine would be giving up a huge swath of territory, home to hundreds of thousands of people and important defensive strongholds, in exchange for almost nothing. Andrii Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told ABC News he believes Putin will almost certainly propose demands he knows are unacceptable so that Ukraine will alienate Trump by rejecting them.

Article: Create your free profile or log in to save this article Create your free profile or log in to save this article A Denver-based company proposing a $30 billion data center on land owned by the widow of NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt in rural Mooresville, North Carolina, will not move forward with the project, a city official and an engineer representing the company said Wednesday. “That’s the only comment I have.” Representatives for Tract, which had pitched the project as a boon for local tax revenue, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Tract spokesperson said last week in a statement to The Charlotte Observer that the company was “both disappointed and surprised” by the mayor’s previous comments indicating he no longer supported the project. When he wasn’t at the racetrack, he was an avid outdoorsman, and neighbors said he used the North Carolina property at the center of the recent battle for hunting and fishing. Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s eldest son, blasted efforts to rezone the property on social media recently, saying his father “would be livid for his name to be associated” with the project. Wednesday’s announcement makes Mooresville the latest city where developers have either backed off their plans for a data center, or had their plans for a data center voted down by local leaders amid public backlash. “We can’t just take rural residential land and destroy it forever.” Late last week, Carney, the mayor, cast doubts on the project’s prospects because Tract hadn’t said which tech company would ultimately use the facility once it was built.

Article: 13 Investigates: New Uvalde records show district limited information, teachers felt ignored UVALDE, Texas (KTRK) -- After a teenager killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one teacher told the district's superintendent, "it feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." On June 12, 2022, a Robb Elementary teacher whose classroom sustained gunshots through its windows recalled details of the attack in an email to the superintendent. I had shrapnel in my back from when he shot in my window, I had blood all over the back of me, but I tried to stay calm for my students." I told my students I loved them, I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray. Robb Elementary School teacher In an email sent 19 days after the deadly shooting, the teacher said she gave every part of herself to the school and her friends and students who died gave their lives. We were asked to be patient and understanding, so I have; but it feels as if the Rodd (sic) staff that survived, especially us in that 4th grade building are being ignored. It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter." That teacher's email was among thousands of pages of emails released this week by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District and provides a peek into behind-the-scenes communications at the district in the days and weeks after the shooting. RELATED: Uvalde school district releases records for 2022 classroom shooting after legal fight over access Previously released body camera video shows Uvalde CISD police and other responding officers stood in the hallway for 77 minutes before breaching the classroom on May 24, 2022. Uvalde CISD records for the now-deceased shooter Salvador Ramos indicate he was absent for 161 days during the 2019-2020 school year and considered "at risk." Notes in his student file say he "has excessive absences and is missing a lot of work," and that he is "failing due to unsubmitted assignments." He was ranked near the end of his class as the 312th student out of 318 students. He withdrew from Uvalde High School in October 2021 for "poor academic performance" and "lack of attendance." Seven months later, Ramos crashed his car near Robb Elementary, entered with an assault rifle, went into a classroom, and within minutes fired more than 100 rounds at elementary school students and teachers. Four days after the shooting, an email from Uvalde CISD's director of student services to nearly 20 employees reminding them not to share campus safety plans with reporters or other outside sources because they are "not public information." "I watched a couple news reports last night and unfortunately there is information being reported that is not accurate. Review your plans and be refreshed on what you have in place and what deficiencies you have at your campus and how they are being addressed," the director said in an email on May 28, 2025. Paul Looney, an attorney for Arredondo, told ABC News, "There is very little that will shed any constructive light on what to do next time or who did or didn't do anything this last time. The hiding of this is pointless and serves nobody any constructive purpose." 13 Investigates reached out to Uvalde CISD and asked if the district's perception changed after more information came out about how things played out that day. "We have pledged to inform our families and the greater Uvalde school community about the release of these documents before they are made available to the media, and this notice serves to uphold that promise," the district said.

Article: President Donald Trump says homeless people in the nation’s capital will be moved far from the city as part of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia and crackdown on crime. takeover as statistics show decline in crime With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. Washington’s status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.” READ MORE: Why this widespread form of homelessness is often overlooked and unsupported Citing a city regulation that she said gives local police “the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments,” Leavitt said homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services.” Those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.” In the past five months, the U.S. Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed. He said the outreach would continue through the week with a “greater level of urgency.” Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.” What are people in Washington saying? Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do. WATCH: DC Mayor Bowser calls Trump takeover of DC police ‘unsettling’ Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she is more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in the city where she was born and raised. In several spots across the city, AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up tents and belongings from parks and other public spaces before more formal removal measures.

Article: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told European leaders during a call on Wednesday that he does not intend to discuss any possible divisions of territory when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this week, according to two European officials and three other people briefed on the call. Trump said on the call, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he is going into the meeting with Putin with the goal of securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, those sources said. Trump and European leaders agreed that a ceasefire in Ukraine has to be implemented before peace negotiations can begin, the European officials and two other people briefed on the call said. Among their concerns is that Trump and Putin might agree to the parameters of a peace deal, including territorial divisions, and then try to pressure Ukraine to agree to it. But the two European officials and three other people briefed on Wednesday’s call said all the leaders agreed that Ukraine must be included in negotiations and should be the one to decide what territorial concessions it might be willing to make. “There’s a very good chance that we’re going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I’m going to find out where we are and what we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to have me there.” The president also said Russia will face “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war.

Article: We haven’t [had] much preparation, but you could see that football is not only about the physical aspect – it is also about the mental aspect, being in the right place, having the right tactics,” PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus. “They sat back a lot after going 2-0 up, and it is dangerous to invite PSG to come at you like that.” The Super Cup is an annual early-season match between the most recent winners of the Champions League (PSG) and Europa League (Tottenham), and it was hardly going to script when the English club took a 2-0 lead early in the second half. Defenders popped up with Spurs’ goals, with Micky van de Ven showing quick reactions to prod home the opener in the 39th minute after new PSG goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha’s shot onto the crossbar. Chevalier – playing ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who announced Tuesday he was leaving PSG – might have been unlucky with the first goal but was to blame for the second after failing to keep out a header from newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero in the 48th. Advertisement Tottenham is further along in its preparations for the new campaign than PSG, whose players have only just returned to training after being involved in the Club World Cup until mid-July, and looked much sharper at Stadio Friuli. PSG finished strongly, though, and hit Tottenham with late goals as Lee smashed in a low shot from the edge of the area and Ramos headed home Ousmane Dembele’s right-wing cross. Frank took over in the offseason following the firing of Ange Postecoglou, who led Tottenham to its first trophy in 17 years with a victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final in May. “I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world – maybe the best in this moment in time,” Frank told TNT Sports. It is a flip of a coin when you go into a penalty shootout.” PSG completed the Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season, also winning the Trophee des Champions in January.

Article: 9 minutes ago Share Save Dominic Casciani • @BBCDomC Home and Legal Correspondent Share Save Reuters The pictures from last week's sit-in protest in Parliament Square over the banned group Palestine Action were unprecedented. As demonstrators held up placards reading, "I support Palestine Action", some 522 of them were arrested on suspicion of breaking terrorism laws - more than double the total such arrests in 2024. The battle over the ban on Palestine Action (PAG) - last month, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - now feels as much a political and PR battle as a legal one. And the organisers of the campaign are trying to capitalise on perceived sympathy among some of the public by organising another demonstration in September - hoping to force the state, through numbers, to lift the ban. "I've seen police look incredibly uncomfortable with the fact that they are having to treat these elderly people as criminals," said solicitor Katie McFadden, who advised many protesters, after their arrests, last Saturday. "I've seen them in police custody and they've certainly been considerate and looked, frankly, quite shocked and horrified that this is what they were having to do as part of their job when they've signed up to go out and protect the public from dangerous criminals." The real challenge for the police and prosecutors is how many protesters do they need to charge with support of a banned terrorist organisation to send a message to the public. EPA The average age of those arrested was 54, police say, with 112 over the age of 70 So far, three people have been charged with displaying an item showing support for Palestine Action during the first demonstration on 5 July. The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had to consult the Attorney General's Office before he could go ahead with the charges because of additional safeguards in some terrorism cases. That means that Lord Hermer, the Attorney General and also a cabinet minister, or his deputy, may have to be involved in each of the files that police send to prosecutors. That, in turn, means the vast majority of the 700 may not know for months if they are going to end up on trial - in cases that could be more than a year away from a jury. Huda Ammori, Palestine Action's co-founder, has said on social media: "The system can't cope when thousands resist." EPA But ministers hope that the difference between the organisation she founded and other forms of protest over Gaza will become clear thanks to the second of the three linked legal battles soon to take centre stage. That incident prompted national security officials and the police to look at whether a terrorism ban on PAG could be justified, after having previously concluded that the vast majority of its highly disruptive activities amounted to minor criminal damage. Metropolitan Police The police set up two arrest processing points in central London to deal with the number of protesters who were arrested Documents disclosed to the BBC in the High Court show how the thinking on a ban had evolved. So when Cooper banned PAG, her decision was largely informed by what the Home Office has described as millions of pounds of criminal damage, not an assessment that it was a group of murderous militants. "There may be people who are objecting to proscription who don't know the full nature of this organisation due to court restrictions on reporting while serious prosecutions are under way but it's really important that no one is in any doubt that this is not a non-violent organisation." TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock If the ban is overturned in the High Court then hundreds of those arrested would see their cases collapse

Article: New York’s attorney general has sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case under the Trump administration FILE - Options to use the Zelle payments network are seen on a mobile banking app in New York, Dec. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) NEW YORK -- New York's attorney general on Wednesday sued the parent company of the Zelle payment platform, months after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar case as the Trump administration was gutting the agency. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this year dropped a similar case after President Donald Trump fired the agency's leader and his administration halted nearly all the bureau's work, closed its headquarters and moved to fire many of its workers. In a statement, James' office noted that its suit was filed after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned its lawsuit following a “change in the federal administration.” “No one should be left to fend for themselves after falling victim to a scam,” James said in a statement. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures.” James has been a leading antagonist of Trump, a Republican, and has sued him dozens of times. Last week, The Associated Press and other news outlets reported that the Justice Department has subpoenaed James as part of an investigation into whether she violated Trump's civil rights, according to people familiar with the matter. In one instance cited by the attorney general's office, a Zelle user got a call from someone posing as an employee of the utility company Con Edison who told the user that his electricity was going to be shut off unless he sent them money through Zelle. The user then transferred about $1,500 to a Zelle account named “Coned Billing" and then realized he had been scammed but was told by his bank that he could not get his money back, James' office said. In a statement issued through a spokesperson, Zelle called James' lawsuit “a political stunt to generate press, not progress.” “The Attorney General should focus on the hard facts, stopping criminal activity and adherence to the law, not overreach and meritless claims,” the statement said.

The vast area stretches from the city of Española, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Santa Fe, to the Colorado state line and has long been afflicted by opioid use and high drug-overdose death rates, with homeless encampments emerging in recent years in more populated areas. “The surge in criminal activity has contributed to increased homelessness, family instability and fatal drug overdoses, placing extraordinary strain on local governments and police departments that have requested immediate state assistance," Lujan Grisham said in a statement. In April, Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency in New Mexico’s largest city, Albuquerque, saying that a significant increase in crime in Albuquerque warrants the help of the New Mexico National Guard. The tribal governor of Santa Clara Pueblo on the edge of Española urged the state to address a growing public safety crisis stemming from the use and abuse of fentanyl and alcohol in the community at large. “But we are not an isolated community and the causes and effects of fentanyl/alcohol abuse, increased crime, and increased homelessness extend to the wider community.” In 2020, President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime.

Article: Plans to expand the oldest wildlife refuge in Texas have been scrapped in favor of President Donald Trump’s effort to “unleash American energy.” The reversal, which was announced last month, has conservationists and advocates concerned about the future of wildlife in the Texas High Plains. At the refuge, located in the small town of Muleshoe about 68 miles northwest of Lubbock, the plan aimed to protect and restore grasslands that are an essential habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Jodey Arrington and Ronny Jackson, Republicans who represent the region and called the acquisition a “land grab.” However, the Biden plan was voluntary, and the service would have worked with willing sellers to expand conservation efforts. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to reducing regulatory burdens, strengthening partnerships with state and local stakeholders, and ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources,” said Justin “J” Shirley, the principal deputy director of the U.S. The refuge may have never expanded into all of those acres, it was just plotted out where they wanted to acquire land if private landowners wanted to sell it to them.” Leahy said the expansion would have brought more hunting and fishing opportunities to the area. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a statement to the Tribune that the service will “take no actions to acquire lands within the acquisition boundary, seek any appropriations from Congress or submit any land acquisition proposals for approval by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for any lands within the LPP expanded acquisition boundary.” Jarid Manos, founder of the Great Plains Restoration Council, said the land, water and native wildlife in the High Plains, including prairie dogs and pronghorn antelope, are clinging to survival. The Ogallala Aquifer is losing its water.” The Great Plains Restoration Council has a program that connects youth and young adults who face social and emotional stress with paid jobs related to restoration efforts.

Article: ADHD drugs have wider life benefits, study suggests 20 minutes ago Share Save Philippa Roxby Health Reporter Share Save Getty Images Drug treatment can help people newly diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to reduce their risk of substance misuse, suicidal behaviour, transport accidents and criminality, a study suggests. The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of: suicidal behaviour - 17% substance misuse - 15% transport accidents - 12% criminal behaviour - 13% When recurrent events were analysed, the researchers found ADHD medication was linked to reductions of: 15% for suicide attempts 25% for substance misuses 4% for accidental injuries 16% for transport accidents 25% for criminal behaviour "Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," said Prof Samuele Cortese, study author and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at University of Southampton. "Now we have evidence they [drugs] can reduce these risks." This could be explained by medication reducing impulsive behaviour and lack of concentration, which might reduce the risk of accidents while driving and reduce aggressive behaviour which could lead to criminality.

Article: That the mainstream press wasn’t, in his view, doing an effective job of conveying the functional racism at play in the Donald Trump-backed gerrymandering effort in Texas, which is deliberately designed to target majority-Black and majority-Latino districts. Unfortunately, we have grown to the point in this country where you can use racism against people of color, but people of color can't respond and say, ‘That’s racism.’ If we do, you’re not going to print it. Just last week, Harmeet Dhillon, the civil rights-averse head of the DOJ’s civil rights division, claimed during an interview that the racist gerrymandering effort in Texas isn’t truly racist but, instead, an effort to dismantle the “racial spoils” that Democrats have purportedly reaped from laws designed to combat racist gerrymandering. Abbott essentially claimed that the GOP plan couldn’t possibly be racist, because it would create additional Hispanic-majority districts, though that obviously doesn’t preclude the maps from being racist to Black people — and it’s worth noting that the new districts were were drawn specifically to favor conservative-leaning Hispanics. During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, DeSantis said he’s entitled to further gerrymander his state’s congressional map because then-President Barack Obama and then-Attorney General Eric Holder “gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade’s census.” That’s another lie, though Obama and Holder have advocated against gerrymandering. In reality, Florida Republicans — who controlled their state’s most recent redistricting process — drew gerrymandered maps that DeSantis pressured them to gerrymander further with a proposal from his office that diluted Black voter power. Nonetheless, the governor portrayed Florida’s map as unfairly weighted in favor of minority groups and claimed “there’s some racial gerrymandering that’s still lingering that we have to correct, per a recent Florida Supreme Court decision.” Indeed, Florida’s Republican-packed Supreme Court ruled last month that DeSantis could move forward with his gerrymandering plan, but the court also acknowledged that the plan would diminish the power of Black voters. All this to say, evidence abounds that Republicans are waging a racist assault on the American voting system — even as they wage a propaganda campaign to present this push as something else entirely.

Article: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones could soon be forced to stop airing his Infowars show and give up the company's property, including everything from desks and microphones to the Infowars brand name. A state judge in Texas Wednesday ordered Infowars' assets to be turned over to a newly-appointed state receiver, who will sell them to pay the families of the Connecticut children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The move paves the way for the receiver — or sheriffs — to start the process of seizing cash and property owned by Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, within days. The families, who've spent some three years in federal bankruptcy court trying to collect what Jones owes them, could start seeing their first payouts through the state court in weeks or months. Sponsor Message "The families are pleased that the court has placed InfoWars parent company into receivership, which will finally lead to accountability for Alex Jones' monstrously cruel harassment" said Mark Bankston, one of the attorneys for the families. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble's order in Travis County, Texas district court appointing a receiver, Gregory Milligan, will also be key to whether Jones gets to keep broadcasting under his Infowars brand or has to start over in some new form. toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America Most of the Sandy Hook families still want the Infowars name and property sold to the satirical site The Onion, which vowed to turn Infowars into a parody of itself. It was a win for Jones, who argued his company should have been sold to First United American Companies, which has ties to Jones and was widely expected to keep him on air. The order adds that "any Sheriff, Constable or officer of the Peace shall assist the Receiver in carrying out his duties and exercising his powers under this Order." Sponsor Message "Now that there's a receiver in place, Alex Jones is no longer going to control the Infowars brand. "It's not a panacea, but it's a more favorable venue to be in," says Larry Ponoroff, dean and professor emeritus at Tulane Law School and a professor of legal practice at Wilmington University School of Law. The Onion did not respond to requests for comment on its plans, but the company has previously vowed to continue trying to buy Infowars to ensure "a positive outcome for the horror [the Sandy Hook families] endured." There was no immediate comment from Jones' lawyers, but Jones himself railed against the judge on his show after the hearing, accusing her of overreach, and saying her order runs afoul of federal bankruptcy court orders. But because the bankruptcy judge ruled Jones' behavior "willful and malicious," the bankruptcy will not erase Jones' debt, meaning families can keep claiming any money he makes in the future until he pays the $1.3 billion he owes them. Sponsor Message The Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his companies for defamation in Connecticut and Texas in 2018, after twenty young children and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting.

Article: Tata Consultancy Services , one of the country's biggest private sector employers, announced last month that more than 12,000 staff in mostly middle and senior management roles would be cut. "Indian IT services companies exploded over the last six months and we've gradually reduced our positions and sold all of them in our portfolio," said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex Japan equity team. And for that kind of growth, valuation and yield, it doesn't make any sense to own it in Asia-Pacific where there are opportunities to buy much cheaper companies with higher yield and growth," Duhra said. India's Nifty IT Index — which comprises 10 Indian IT companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — has plunged nearly 20% so far this year, underperforming the 22.2% surge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and the 12.16% gain in the Nasdq-100 Technology Sector Index. Not a unique problem But Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M & G Investments, said the problems arising from automation that Indian tech firms face are not unique to the country. "We expect Infosys to post 3.8% y-y USD revenue growth in FY26F (including around 40 basis from acquisitions )," he said, adding that he has a buy rating at a price target of 1,880 Indian rupees ($21.47), giving it 31.86% upside potential. Bhandari also pointed out that the company added 210 staff in its fiscal first quarter ended June, which represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of around 0.1% after accounting for attrition. Coforge is Bhandari's "preferred pick" in this segment, as he forecasts it can "easily deliver around 30% revenue growth this year — multiples of what large-caps are going to do." Of 34 analysts covering the stock, 23 give it a buy or overweight rating, four have a hold rating, while seven have a sell or underweight call, according to FactSet data.

Article: As a wary Washington waited, the White House promised a ramp-up of National Guard troops and federal officers on the streets of the nation's capital around the clock starting Wednesday, days after President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the city's police department for at least a month. The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an "authoritarian push" at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix - even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin A "significantly higher" presence of guard members was expected Wednesday night, and federal agents will be out during the day as well as at night, according to the White House. Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. She added, "It's Day Three and he's already saying he's going to need more time?" Targeting a variety of infractions The arrests made by 1,450 federal and local officers across the city included those for suspicion of driving under the influence and unlawful entry, as well as a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, according to the White House. The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Violent crime has dropped in the district The federal effort comes even after a drop in violent crime in the nation's capital, a trend that experts have seen in cities across the U.S. On average, the level of violence Washington remains mostly higher than averages in three dozen cities analyzed by the nonprofit Council on Criminal Justice, said the group's president and CEO, Adam Gelb. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, "I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too." She had previously called Trump's moves "unsettling and unprecedented" while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. "It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American." ___ Associated Press writers Konstantin Toropin and Will Weissert, photographer Jacquelyn Martin and video journalist River Zhang contributed to this report.

Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. "I have a very rebellious character." He is the most prominent person charged under the controversial national security law which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. Reuters Lai is among the most prominent people charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city. Getty Images Apple Daily was unafraid to be openly critical of the Chinese state When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the "death knell" for the territory. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: "Mr President, please help us." For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.

Article: Hot, dry summers bring new 'firewave' risk to UK cities, scientists warn 1 hour ago Share Save Justin Rowlatt • @BBCJustinR Climate Editor Share Save Getty Images A firefighter tackling a fire in east London on Tuesday Cities across the UK are facing a growing threat from an emerging phenomenon called "firewaves" as temperatures rise due to climate change, scientists have warned. The warning comes as firefighters battled three separate heath fires in London and a dramatic gorse blaze on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in recent days, as this summer's latest heatwave left vegetation across both capitals dangerously dry. "Vegetation doesn't just become a bit more flammable," explained Professor Rein, "it becomes much more flammable." "Once the moisture content of the vegetation drops below a certain threshold, even a small spark can lead to a fast-spreading fire," he added. "I worry about all other UK cities and other northern European cities in particular because climate change seems to be making green vegetation that was not flammable very flammable indeed," said Prof Rein. "And these places don't have a history of dealing with wildfires so don't have as much institutional experience as cities in the south of the continent." Managing fire risk Urban environments like London, with their abundance of parks and green spaces bordering residential zones, are particularly susceptible. "We're seeing more extreme weather events, and that's why the London Fire Brigade has adopted a much more proactive approach." BBC / Kevin Church This area of Dagenham was hit by a fire earlier this year To meet this growing challenge, the LFB says it has invested in new technologies and equipment.

The paper reported that European leaders have been worried that Trump "might be prepared to strike a deal on territory" without the input of Zelensky, and that the Wednesday meeting went some way to "calm their fears". After meeting with European leaders, the Guardian reports that Trump said he would push for a second meeting with Putin "almost immediately" if his Friday summit in Alaska goes well. The front page also features a story on foreign aid, with the paper reporting that ministers are considering "scrapping" a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid on projects that support gender equality. The Telegraph says that the meeting in Alaska will see Trump offer Putin access to "rare earth minerals" as an "incentive" to end the war in Ukraine, and that the US president is also prepared to lift sanctions on the Russia's aviation industry. The Times has similarly headlined with Trump's "warning to Putin on eve of talks", and allege the US and Russia have already discussed a "model" for ending the war that would "mirror Israel's occupation of the West Bank". "Fight house" reads the Daily Star's front page, as the paper reports Trump is planning to "host UFC fight bouts on the lawns of the White House" in 2026 to celebrate 250 years of America. The Express says policing minister Dame Diana Johnson "provoked ridicule" after her comments on BBC Radio 4 when she condemned shoplifters but said "stores need to play their part in making sure that items that are high value are not at the front".

Article: What we learned from Taylor Swift's highly anticipated podcast interview 45 minutes ago Share Save Max Matza & Christal Hayes BBC News Share Save Watch: Taylor Swift appears in Travis and Jason Kelce's podcast 'New Heights' Taylor Swift made her highly anticipated podcast debut on New Heights, hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce. The pop superstar used the appearance to announce her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and give some updates on her life since the Eras Tour, which ran almost two years and spanned five continents before ending in December. More than 1.3 million tuned in live for the programme as Swift offered insights into her relationship with Travis, the notorious easter eggs she plants in music for fans and even titbits on her sourdough-bread-baking hobby. Teaser clips of the New Heights podcast went viral before her episode aired, including one video clip where Swift unveils a briefcase with "TS" on it and pulls out her new 12th studio album, which will be available 3 October. Poking fun at male sports fans The episode begins with a screaming introduction from Jason, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, who runs through a long list of his brother's girlfriend's accomplishments, including being the only artist to win the album of the year Grammy four times. In 2023 when the pair started dating and she started making appearances, game cameras looked for the singer in the stands - cutting to her more than a dozen times during some games. Swift was booed by NFL fans during her appearance on the jumbotron screen at the Super Bowl last February, which drew headlines and even social media posts by President Donald Trump. What the cover of her new album looks like Taylor Swift announces new album during podcast As the countdown clock ran down on her website and the podcast started, Swift's website updated with the cover of her 12th studio album. Insights into how she crafts her hidden easter eggs She also spoke about all the ways she uses easter eggs to tease her music and plant hidden clues for fans. The hidden clues are "something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason, but you'll go back and be like 'Oh my God!'" She said that her favourite example was a speech she gave when she received an honourary doctorate. "I put so many lyrical easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnights album came out, after that, the fans were like, 'The whole speech was an easter egg!'" She spoke about her love of numbers and dates. Taylor gets emotional speaking about her masters In May this year, it was announced that she had bought the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running and highly publicised battle over the ownership of her music. "I want this because it was my handwritten diary entries from my entire life." She said that her mother and brother talked with with Shamrock Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, about purchasing her music. She also thanked loyal fans for listening to her re-recorded albums, saying they reacted to the dispute over rights to her music with the Western cowboy expression, "We ride at dawn". "I think a lot of the vocals I did on the re-records were better than the original," she said, adding that she is especially fond of the remake of her 2012 album Red.

Article: Starmer sees viable chance of Russia-Ukraine ceasefire 23 minutes ago Share Save Kate Whannel Political reporter Share Save EPA Keir Starmer co-chairing a virtual meeting of the coalition of the willing There is a "viable chance" of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said, ahead of Friday's summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week Trump warned there could be "some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both", leading to fears Ukraine might have to give up some areas in order to end the bloody conflict. Addressing a virtual meeting of the European leaders following the call with Trump, Sir Keir said "any ceasefire would have to be lasting and to be lasting it would need security guarantees". The coalition is a group of mainly European countries who have pledged to provide military support to Ukraine - including potentially boots on the ground - in order to deter Russia from breaching any agreed peace deal. "Now we do have that chance, because of the work the president has put in." Vance is currently on a private family holiday in the UK, and also joined the call with Sir Keir and other European leaders on Wednesday. The vice-president said the two countries had a "beautiful alliance" and that the US had "worked with our friends from the United Kingdom to achieve great victories" over the past 100 years. "When we fight together, when we make it clear that we always approach every situation with an open hand - but if things go poorly, we're willing to do what we have to do, we make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world."

Article: Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plaintiffs in the case, a group of international aid groups, did not have the legal standing to bring a lawsuit. "The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells." In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit," Warren said.

Article: White, whose Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, on an idyllic waterfront estate in Connecticut, gave generations of budding playwrights a chance to try out their latest works — many of which went on to success in New York and elsewhere — died at his home in Waterford, Conn., on Aug. Since its first summer conference for playwrights was held in 1965, the O’Neill, named in honor of the playwright who spent much of his life in nearby New London, has helped incubate generations of new talent, including John Guare, August Wilson and Sam Shepard, all of whom made the trek to eastern Connecticut. There, on a sprawling property that rolled down to Long Island Sound, they lived, ate and worked together, far from the pressure exerted by producers, critics, actors and everyone else who, for better or worse, shape the public presentation of a play.

Article: President Donald Trump criticized Goldman on Tuesday for predicting that tariffs would push up inflation, and said Solomon "should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ." In response, Goldman defended the results of its study, according to a CNBC interview with the bank's economist David Mericle. "If the most recent tariffs, like the April tariff, follow the same pattern that we've seen with those earliest February tariffs, then eventually, by the fall, we estimate that consumers would bear about two-thirds of the cost," Mericle said. UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote that "the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices," while Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase , said in a note that tariffs could "add 1-1.5% to inflation, some of which has already occurred." Of course, a consensus view does not mean predictions will come true. In any case, if Goldman — and economists from other banks —is proven wrong on tariff-driven inflation, and Trump, in a hypothetical scenario, manages to somehow push Solomon out of his position, at least DJ D-Sol will still be out there spinning records.

Article: By the end of the century, rising sea levels could push powerful seasonal waves into Easter Island’s 15 iconic moai statues, according to a new study published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. “Sea level rise is real,” said Noah Paoa, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. “It’s not a distant threat.” Paoa, who is from Easter Island — known to its Indigenous people as Rapa Nui — and his colleagues built a high-resolution “digital twin” of the island’s eastern coastline and ran computer models to simulate future wave impacts under various sea level rise scenarios. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.” Possible defenses for Ahu Tongariki range from armoring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.
